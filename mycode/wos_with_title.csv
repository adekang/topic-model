Coordination Energetic Materials-Scientific Curiosity or Future of Energetic Material Applications?,"Significant incentives for developing and introducing new energetic materials to the industrial-scale production and application of new energetic materials have stimulated extensive research on the subject. Despite numerous studies, which have reported a broad array of results, progress in this field remains limited as the research results do not translate into commensurate practical applications. Coordination energetic materials are one of the promising classes of such materials. Despite more than two decades of research efforts dedicated to these substances and their advantages over classical energetic materials, in terms of performance parameters and safety parameters, these materials have not found any broader practical application. In this work, selected representative literature reports dedicated to these materials have been analysed in order to present the possible reasons for this state. Some suggestions about the future direction of research and development efforts dedicated to coordination energetic materials have also been formulated. The publication is one voice in the discussion on new challenges related to the search for new lead-free explosives.",2022
Amination of energetic anions: high-performing energetic materials,"The new energetic materials 2-amino-5-nitrotetrazole (ANT, 1), 1-amino-3,4-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole (ADNT, 2), and both 1,1'-diamino-5,5'-bistetrazole and 1,2'-diamino-5,5'-bistetrazole (11DABT, 3 and 12DABT, 4) have been prepared by the amination of the parent anion with O-tosylhydroxylamine. The 5-H-tetrazolate anion has also been aminated using hydroxylamine O-sulfonic acid to both 1-aminotetrazole and 2-aminotetrazole (1AT, 5 and 2AT, 6). The prepared materials have been characterized chemically (XRD (1-4, 6 center dot AtNO2, 8), multinuclear NMR, IR, Raman) and as explosives (mechanical and electrostatic sensitivity) and their explosive performances calculated using the EXPLO5 computer code. The prepared N-amino energetic materials, which can also be used as new ligands for high energy-capacity transition metal complexes, exhibit high explosive performances (in the range of hexogen and octogen) and a range of sensitivities from low to extremely high.",2012
Imidazolium-Based Energetic Materials,"We show that 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium salts, as well as the salts of their nitrite esters, that include oxidizing anions (so-called explosphores) such as nitrate, picrate and perchlorate are endowed with high enthalpies of decomposition, high decomposition temperatures, and high densities. This combined with detonation velocities and pressures calculated using Explo5, indicates that especially the perchlorate salts have potential as energetic materials. All the studied salts are easily preparable in up to gram scale through two or three synthetic steps from simple imidazole. Many of these salts are ionic liquids, which may render them useful as energetic plasticizers or gel filled materials.",2022

Making Energetic Materials Safer,"Canine (K9) units and scientists developing explosives trace detection devices (ETDs) work with and are expose to energetic materials when imprinting the dog or building instrument libraries. However, access to extremely hazardous materials, such as explosives, is limited, with a great need for training aids that provide a safe-handling and long shelf-life material. In order to address these needs, encapsulation of energetic materials, such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP), erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) in a polymer matrix have been developed, and extensively characterized to ensure explosive desensitization, controlled released, clean background odor and delivery of the pure explosive as effective training aids. Although, peroxide explosives, such as TATP and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) are a prominent threat, and their detection a priority within K9 units and ETD manufacturers, their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in the body have not been investigated. TATP is volatile and HMTD is lipophilic allowing for their inhalation and dermal absorption. Their distribution to the body was evaluated with blood incubations, which determined that TATP is stable for at least a week, while HMTD is degraded within minutes. Hepatic metabolism was investigated with microsomal and recombinant enzyme incubations. The metabolism of TATP undergoes hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) to form TATP-OH, which undergoes glucuronidation catalyzed by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7) to form TATP-O-glucuronide, which was excreted in the urine of laboratory personnel and bomb-sniffing dogs exposed to TATP. Detection of these peroxide explosives and/or their metabolites in biological matrices (e.g. blood and urine) can be used as forensic evidence to exposure; therefore, paper spray ionization mass spectrometry was exploited as a robust analytical method for the analysis of peroxide explosives in in vitro and in vivo biological samples.",2020
"Zwitterionic Energetic Materials: Synthesis, Structural Diversity and Energetic Properties","Zwitterionic compounds are an emergent class of energetic materials and have gained synthetic interest of many in the recent years. Due to their better packing efficiencies and strong inter/intramolecular electrostatic interactions, they often ensue superior energetic properties than their salt analogues. A systematic review from the perspective of design, synthesis, and physicochemical properties evaluation of the zwitterionic energetic materials is presented. Depending on the parent ring(s) used for the synthesis and the type of moieties bearing positive and negative charges, different classes of energetic materials, such as primary explosives, secondary explosives, heat resistant explosives, oxidizers, etc., may result. The properties of some of the energetic zwitterionic compounds are also compared with analogous energetic salts. This review will encourage readers to explore the possibility of designing new zwitterionic energetic materials. A systematic review from the perspective of design, synthesis, and physicochemical properties evaluation of the zwitterionic energetic materials is presented. The properties of some of the energetic zwitterionic compounds are also compared with analogous energetic salts. This review will encourage energetic material researchers in developing novel zwitterionic energetic materials with balanced overall properties. image",2024
Progress towards nanoengineered energetic materials,"Given the constraints on typical bond energies and the commonality of final products produced from combustion of C-H-N-O based energetic materials, the possibilities for further increases in stored potential energy and thermodynamic performance from these classes of materials are limited. Thus, modulating the energy release to achieve efficiency and effectiveness for desired applications is of great value. Investigation of nanomaterials as energetic materials began more than twenty years ago with much of the interest to increase reaction rates and reduce sensitivity. During this period, research on energetic nanoparticles was devoted to reducing the loss of energy density with metallic materials due to the naturally occurring oxide passivating layer, managing their high surface area preventing high loadings in solids, minimizing particle-particle interactions making dispersion in the gas-phase difficult, and understanding combustion mechanisms. As an outcome, novel synthesis methods of producing nanocomposites, and new fields of applications, such as micro-pyrotechnics, have developed. Yet, the research community is only beginning to understand how to ma-nipulate and build energetic materials at the nanoscale, and what designs are optimal for desired functions. Furthermore, recognizing the difficulties for increased energy density and reduced sensitivity, the development of multifunctional and smart nanoenergetic materials is currently being researched to enable control of energy release rates and material sensitivity on demand. This research is being advanced by assembly of na-noengineered energetic materials to bulk scales by additive manufacturing, the development and application of combustion diagnostics that resolve nanometer and micron scales, and ab initio quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations. The challenges that have been confronted and the directions of continuing research on nanoenergetics are presented and discussed. (c) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Discrete effects in energetic materials,"The classical theory of detonation wave propagation has been highly successful in prediction of detonation dynamics based on a macroscopic, continuum-based approach, wherein the heterogeneity of the energetic material only enters the model via the reaction rate term (e.g., hot-spot based reaction mechanisms). The effects of spatial heterogeneity are rarely treated explicitly in detonation models. However, considerable evidence can be found that mesoscale phenomenon can influence the dynamics of the detonation front on scales larger than the heterogeneities. Two scenarios are identified that may result in spatial non-uniformity of the detonation front influencing the macroscopic dynamics of the wave propagation: (1) large-scale heterogeneities and (2) transverse or longitudinal instability of the front. This evidence is critically reviewed, and possible directions for modeling approaches that incorporate the spatial granularity (discreteness) of the energetic material are suggested.",2014
Molecular characterization of energetic materials,"Assessing hazards due to energetic or reactive chemicals is a challenging and complicated task and has received considerable attention from industry and regulatory bodies. Thermal analysis techniques, such as Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), are commonly employed to evaluate reactivity hazards. A simple classification based on energy of reaction (−ΔH), a thermodynamic parameter, and onset temperature (T o ), a kinetic parameter, is proposed with the aim of recognizing more hazardous compositions. The utility of other DSC parameter in predicting explosive properties is discussed. Calorimetric measurements to determine reactivity can be resource consuming, so computational methods to predict reactivity hazards present an attractive option. Molecular modeling techniques were employed to gain information at the molecular scale to predict calorimetric data. Molecular descriptors, calculated at density functional level of theory, were correlated with DSC data for mono nitro compounds applying Quantitative Structure Property Relationships (QSPR) and yielded reasonable predictions. Such correlations can be incorporated into a software program for a priori prediction of potential reactivity hazards. Estimations of potential hazards can greatly help to focus attention on more hazardous substances, such as hydroxylamine (HA), which was involved in two major industrial incidents in the past four years. A detailed discussion of HA investigation is presented.",2003
Terahertz spectroscopy of energetic materials,"Recently, terahertz spectroscopy has attracted increasing interest as a probe of organic molecular crystals such as pharmaceutical compounds and explosives. Terahertz time- domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) focuses on low-frequency (10-120 cm(-1)) intermolecular modes that are characteristic of the crystal structure. The prospect of material-specific identification, combined with the ability of THz light to penetrate many common materials, has lead to an emphasis on the prospect of a THz-based, standoff explosives detection device. In this presentation, THz spectra of materials ranging from military-grade explosives to home-made explosive components will be discussed. In addition to the experimental results, THz spectral assignments will be presented based on solid-state density functional theory simulations. Finally, the effect of particle size on the observed spectra will also be considered.",2011
New plasticizers for energetic materials,"Specific features of the synthesis of new nitroxy-containing N,N'-bis(alkylnitramine) mixtures have been considered. The results of studying the plasticizing ability of the mixtures with respect to various cellulose nitrates, as well as the performance data on energetic materials on their basis, have been reported. Combustion of both the plasticizers and compositions on their basis has been studied in detail.",2007
Molecular Models of Energetic Materials,"A material is considered energetic if a significant portion of the constitutive compounds possesses a molecular structure that can release large quantities of stored chemical energy. Highly energetic materials are commonly employed in the defense and aerospace industries for their application as propellants. Due to the chemical nature of the energy storage, a large portion of molecular simulations of energetic materials have been conducted from a quantum mechanical perspective. Studies of energetic materials that employ classical atomistic models do exist, but the chemical space covered by these classical studies is small when compared to the literature of quantum mechanical studies. One reason for this difference is the requirement of high fidelity force fields for the production of quantitatively meaningful results when using a classical atomistic model. Only a handful of classical models exist for different energetic materials and the parameterization process is typically tedious. The primary focus of this work is the development of classical atomistic models for conventional solid propellant that contains ammonium perchlorate and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. The secondary focus of this work is the investigation of modifying classical models and parameterizing polarizable models for studying energetic deep eutectic solvents.",2021
Electro-analysis of energetic materials,"Cyclic voltammetric studies of triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN), 3,3'-hydrazino bis(bis[6,6'-(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-lyl])-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (HBPT), 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan (DNBF) and 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) were carried out at different pH conditions in 50% aqueous acetonitrile using glassy carbon electrode. Optimum pH was selected for individual compounds. Influence of scan rate and concentration on the voltammetric response were studied in optimum pH. The number of electron transferred was determined by controlled potential coulometry. All compounds undergo diffusion controlled electrochemical reaction. Based on cyclic voltammetric results, differential pulse and square wave voltammetric methods have been developed for the analytical determination. Instrumental parameters such as initial scan potential, amplitude, pulse increment, pulse period, pulse width and frequency were studied. Optimum experimental conditions for each compound were obtained. After fixing optimum conditions, the effect of concentration was studied and calibration plot was arrived. These plots can be used to determine the traces of the above said four energetic materials. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2007
Thermal conductivity of energetic materials,"Thermal conductivity has been determined for a variety of energetic materials (EMs) using finite element analysis (FEA) and cookoff data from the Sandia Instrumented Thermal Ignition (SITI) experiment. Materials studied include melt-cast, pressed, and low-density explosives. The low-density explosives were either prills or powders with some experiments run at pour density (not pressed). We have compared several of our thermal conductivities with those in the literature as well as investigated contact resistance between the confining aluminum and explosive, multidimensional heat transfer effects, and uncertainty in the thermocouple bead positions. We have determined that contact resistance is minimal in the SITI experiment, the heat transfer along the midplane is one-dimensional, and that uncertainty in the thermocouple location is greatest near the heated boundary. Our values of thermal conductivity can be used with kinetic mechanisms to accurately predict thermal profiles and energy dissipation during the cookoff of explosives.",2020
Energetic Materials: Synthesis to Detonation,"Energetics like 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) have been around for over a century, and although use as a military explosive has dwindled since World War II, picric acid is a popular choice for armature chemists in part to the ease of production and availability of starting materials. To better understand the threat picric acid presents, five published synthetic routs were studied along with five starting materials. Reactions provided a wide range of conditions in which picric acid could be prepared. Recovered materials were methodically characterized using Raman and Infrared spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray analysis. Characterization of recovered material shed light on the role synthetic conditions and starting materials play in the formation of picric acid as well as unexpected side-products. Generally, synthetic methods which used laboratory style starting materials or reagents produced pure picric acid. An exception to this was a multi-step reaction which, in addition to picric acid, produced lesser nitrated phenols. Methods that used commercially available or “over-the-counter” (OTC) starting materials or reagents like aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or a skin treatment powder (salicylic acid) exhibited the most deviation in recovered products. A simple substitution of concentrated sulfuric acid for drain cleaner led to the formation and isolation of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid instead of picric acid. Reactions which used potassium picrate as a nitration source saw the formation of the metal salt potassium picrate allowing for the easy identification of method used. Although the reaction types and materials tested were far from exhaustive, this work provides a better understanding of the preparation of picric acid. There is a dual role that explosive materials must play for military ordnance, which seem to, at times, incompatible. They must be safe to handle, transport, and insensitive to accidental initiation. These same materials must also fully detonate when intended, leaving no unreacted material, and have the highest explosive performance possible. To obtain this goal additives were used to modify explosive behavior of a pressed explosive formulation of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) with polyethylene wax and pressed 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN). Chemically inert additives like glass and polymer microspheres or balloons were tested against microencapsulated pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and thermally expandable microspheres (TEMs). Additives were incorporated into the RDX formulation, then pressed into 13 mm pellets for detonation testing as rate sticks. Incorporation of additives was assessed via micro-X-ray CT. Explosive tests were recorded by high-speed cameras. The detonation velocity of formulations containing inert additives were compared to those with reactive materials added. Although all additives tested reduced the detonation velocity of the formulation compared to the base material, reactive additives allowed for the performance to be tailored. Formulations containing TEMs had a consistent detonation velocity (7.90–7.94 km/s) over a wide range of concentrations (0.5–2.5 % vol). However, after heating to 120 °C for 30 minutes, the TEMs would irreversibly expand inside the formulation decreasing the density of the pellet, in turn, lowering the detonation velocity up to 20% for pellets with 20% vol additive. This drastic reduction in detonation velocity allows for the performance of an explosive formulation to be modified after manufacture, a long-sought goal for tunable munitions. Addition of microencapsulated PETN in formulations had comparable performance to formulations with neat crystalline PETN added. Microencapsulation of PETN reduced the sensitivity of the nitrate ester to impact and friction, lowing the sensitivity of the material from 5.5 J (impact) and 60 N (friction) for the neat PETN, to over 109 J (impact) and 355 N (friction) once microencapsulated. Sensitivity to shock was measured, microcapsules of PETN were packed into a rate sick and shocked by booster pellets of RDX:wax. The reaction light coupled in from booster pellets quicky extinguished roughly halfway through the rate stick (24 mm) indicating that the microcapsules could not sustain a detonation. Pressed RDX:wax formulations that contained microencapsulated PETN performed similarly to those with crystalline PETN added (8.15 km/s vs 8.11 km/s at 5% and 7.83 km/s vs 7.78 km/s at 20%). In the case for pressed pellets of DNAN, microencapsulated PETN stabilized the detonation in the inert material. DNAN with added microencapsulated PETN had a detonation velocity of 5.10 km/s at 5% wt and 5.00 at 20% wt, where neat DNAN would fail to detonate at the same 13 mm diameter scale. Although these mixtures had lower detonation velocities than DNAN mixed with crystalline PETN (5.24 km/s at 5% wt, and 5.30 km/s at 20% wt), microencapsulated PETN did not sensitize the mixture to impact or friction unlike the addition of crystalline PETN. Although in these formulations PETN was only present in very small amounts, in comparison to the bulk explosive, it did contribute to the detonation of tested formulations without sensitization of the formulation to impact or friction. Initiation criteria of an explosive is of paramount importance. Small changes in pressure or detonation velocity can have a compounding effect. Characterizing and recording explosive events required high precision timing as events occur at rate at, or above kilometers per second. Mixtures of RDX with the tree resin “red gum” at 90:10, 95:5, and 98:8 (by weight) explosive to binder were prepared by dry- or wet-mixing. Coating RDX with red gum did not change the sensitivity of the material to impact or friction and had no effect in thermal decomposition by differential scanning calorimetry. Resulting powders were pressed into 13 mm diameter pellets with densities ranging from 1.628–1.683 g/cc. Pellets were tested as rate sticks and recorded using high-speed cameras. Particle velocity at end pellets into an acrylic window was observed by photon doppler velocimetry (PDV). Formulations had detonation velocities between 8.04–8.50 km/s, and an output pressure between 24–29 GPa. Use of red gum as a molding powder afforded structurally ridged explosive pellets, with consistent detonation velocities and output pressures, all while not requiring specialized processing facilities to prepare said formulations. Due to the consistency and ease of preparation, RDX:RG is a good candidate for small-scall explosive testing.",2022
Towards Groundbreaking Green Energetic Materials,"There is an increasingly pressing need for new, high-performance, environmentally benign energetic materials. Indeed, the state-of-the-art explosives and propellants are causing growing concern over their detrimental impact on the environment and human health. It is extremely challenging to find alternatives to the compounds currently in use, which are high performing, relatively insensitive and inexpensive to synthesize. This challenge requires the synthesis of new types of compounds. This dissertation summarizes my contribution to this effort. The approach of the Christe-Haiges research group to the synthesis of new energetic materials involves the targeting of groundbreaking, novel, highly challenging species, the development of efficient synthetic pathways and the characterization of these species. Chapters 2-3 deal with derivatives of 3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole, an energetic building block with suitable properties for potential applications. In CHAPTER 2 the improved synthesis of 3,5-dinitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole (HDNT) and the first structural characterizations of that compound, which had been used in situ for decades, are described. This chapter also discusses the identifcation and structural characterization of common impurities formed when literature synthetic methods are followed. Some of these impurities were found to be dangerously more sensitive than the targetted HDNT. CHAPTER 3 describes the synthesis and structural characterization of over twenty 3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazolate (DNT) salts and polymorphs thereof, most of which are highly thermally stable and insensitive. CHAPTER 4-CHAPTER 7 describe the syntheses of hydro‐borane and ‐borate compounds with energetic ligands. Halogen‐free boron‐based energetic materials are promising compounds because of their environmentally benign combustion products and because of the high heat of formation of boron oxide. CHAPTER 4 describes the synthesis of salts of nitroazolate‐trihydroborate complex anions using, among several nitroazolates, some of the precursors described in CHAPTER 2 and CHAPTER 3. CHAPTER 5 describes the synthesis and full characterization of the first room temperature‐stable solid salts of trinitromethyl‐trihydroborate. The compounds demonstrate that boron hydrides can form stable derivatives even with highly oxidizing moieties. CHAPTER 6 describes the synthesis of the dinitramide‐substituted ammonia‐borane NH₃.BH₂[N(NO₂)₂], another example of a surprisingly stable energetic boron compound and the first structurally characterized Group 13‐dinitramide compound. CHAPTER 7 describes the observation of several dinitramide‐hydroborates, which demonstrates the potential use of dinitramide as a weakly coordinating anion. CHAPTER 8 describes the synthesis and characterization of nitryl cyanide, a small molecule which had long eluded synthesis. This species is another spectacular example of the combination of a strong oxidizer and a reducing group. The energy density of this molecule is extremely high and the compound could eventually serve as a replacement for hydrazine as a monopropellant. CHAPTER 9 describes the synthesis of fluorodinitramide, a particularly reactive and marginally stable compound which was characterized by low‐temperature NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. The study of the compound provided insight into the stability of the intriguing fluoronitroamine family.",2015
Intermolecular interactions of energetic materials,"A variety of intermolecular interactions occurs when an energetic material responds to its surroundings. With a better grasp of these energetic material contacts, improved performance on plastic-bonded explosives, superior swab materials for explosives detection, and novel insensitive munitions are possible. In order to further understand these interactions, the following relationships were researched: adhesion between energetic materials and polymer substrates; quantitative collection and detection of energetic materials on electrostatically charged swabs; and noncovalent derivative investigation between energetic material pairs. A number of explosives detectors rely on introduction of the analyte to the instrument via swabs. However, most swab materials are burdened by either poor sorption (pickup) or poor desorption (release). Therefore, finding a swab that can both easily sorb and desorb an explosive is highly desirable. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), while normally employing a sharp (~5 nm) tip for topographic and force measurements, can also be used to measure adhesion between a material and substrate surface. AFM force curve experiments were performed on eleven polymers with nine energetic materials, organic explosives, and energetic salts. Teflon was the least adhesive polymer to all energetic materials, while no distinct trend could be elucidated among the other polymers or energetics. Rather than create a novel swab material for explosives detection, improving current commercial off the shelf (COTS) swabs would be a fast and cost-effective way to increase analyte detection on existing security instrumentation. For this reason, the viability of electrostatically charging COTS swabs was explored. COTS swabs were charged both triboelectrically and inductively, and charge degradation both in time and through changes in relative humidity was determined. For collection efficiency, transfer efficiency, and uncharged swab comparison, quantification of energetic materials on a triple quadrupole liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer was performed. Limits of quantification for trace amounts of energetic material were typically in the single nanogram level. In addition to adsorption of energetic material comparable to traditional uncharged swabs, electrostatically charged swabs can also adsorb material at standoff, introducing a new noncontact sampling method. The synthesis of the next generation of explosives is increasingly difficult because available novel reagents and synthetic techniques are limited. Energetic material solvates have been known for nearly 65 years, but cocrystallization of an energetic material and another solid has only been demonstrated in the last decade. Relying on noncovalent derivatives (NCDs), cocrystals can tailor explosive properties such as density and detonation velocity, potentially yielding a new energetic material without novel molecule synthesis. The most common synthons for pharmaceutical cocrystallization involve carboxylic acid and amide functionalities, but the majority of common energetic materials are devoid of these groups. With the wealth of knowledge from pharmaceutical cocrystals, utilizing these groups could yield more effective screening for energetic cocrystal pairs. Herein, we present the TNT-nicotinamide cocrystal, an energetic cocrystal with an amide synthon.",2016
Nanoscale additives tailor energetic materials,"The effect of anatase, rutile, and amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles on the combustion of solid rocket propellant was investigated. Each additive increased the burning rate of propellant strands by 30%. Typical fast-burning propellants are unstable due to oversensitivity to pressure variations, but the anatase additive yielded propellants with high yet stable burning rates over a broad pressure range. Anatase nanoparticles also catalyzed the high-temperature decomposition of ammonium perchlorate, a key component of solid propellant.",2007
Curvilinear deflagration of energetic materials,"The effects of material interface curvature on deflagration of a homogeneous solid energetic material ( EM) is studied in a limit when the radius of curvature is much larger than the deflagration front thickness. Under the assumption of quasi- steady burning, a method of matched asymptotics is employed do derive first- order curvature corrections to the mass flux across the gas - solid interface as well as to the interface temperature. As an illustration, a problem of quasi- steady spherical particle deflagration is solved numerically and the simulation results are used to verify those obtained through asymptotic analysis. An algorithm for a fully- coupled unsteady solver suitable for EM deflagration simulation is presented. Numerical solution of the unsteady spherical particle deflagration is used to show that the assumption of quasi- steady deflagration is valid.",2007
Energetic materials at extreme conditions,"In order to effectively model the behaviour of energetic materials under operational conditions it is essential to obtain detailed structural information for these compounds at elevated temperature and/or pressures. The structural characterisation of the high explosives RDX and CL-20 and a series of inorganic azides [Mn+(N3)n] at extreme conditions is described herein. In addition to the characterisation of a highly metastable β -form of RDX (1,3,5- trinitrohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine) at atmospheric pressure, the structure solution of a high-pressure/ high-temperature polymorph is described. This form, obtained above 4.3 GPa and 450 K, has been shown to be distinct from the β -form and has therefore been denoted - RDX. Furthermore, ε -RDX is sufficiently metastable to allow its recovery to ambient pressure at 150 K; it only transforms to the α -form upon warming to 230 K. Finally, the ambient-temperature compression of RDX has been investigated to a maximum pressure of 23.0 GPa, using methanol:ethanol (4:1) as the pressure-transmitting medium; no phase transition was observed under these conditions, other than the α → γ transition at 3.9 GPa. The structure of a high-pressure polymorph of CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12- hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane) has also been determined by a combination of powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compression of γ -CL-20 to above 0.7 GPa using Fluorinert (FC-77) as the pressure-transmitting medium results in a phase transition to the ζ -form, which has been found to display structural similarities with both theγ γ - and ε -forms. The high-pressure behaviour of CL-20, however, depends markedly on the starting polymorph and the pressure-transmitting medium selected. Compression of γ -CL-20 in MeOH:EtOH (4:1) results in the formation of a 2:1 CL-20:MeOH solvate at 0.5 GPa. This solvate is stable upon compression to P > 5.0 GPa. It may also be recovered to ambient pressure at 293 K. Meanwhile, no phase transition is observed during the compression of ε -CL-20 to a maximum pressure of 7.2 GPa. Finally, a series of inorganic azides [NaN3, CsN3, TlN3, NH4N3, AgN3 and Pb(N3)2] has been characterised under a range of pressure and temperature conditions. Of the six compounds studied, all displayed at least one polymorphic transition – 5 new forms have been structurally characterised in this work and evidence of another 5 is presented. The combined effect of pressure and temperature results in sodium azide adopting a tetragonal structure common to larger alkali metal azides. Caesium azide has been shown to undergo three phase transitions during compression to 6.0 GPa – the structure of the first high-pressure form is reported. A variable temperature X-ray powder diffraction study of TlN3 has allowed the structural characterisation of the low-temperature TlN3-IV (at 230 K) as well as providing evidence for a phase transition to a high-temperature form above 550 K. The high-pressure form III (obtained above 0.76 GPa) has also been determined by neutron powder diffraction. Silver, ammonium and lead(II) azides have all been shown to undergo a phase transition at high pressures. Compression of silver azide (P > 0.80 GPa) removes an orthorhombic distortion observed at atmospheric pressure, resulting in the tetragonal structure adopted by CsN3 and TlN3 under ambient conditions. Moreover, NH4N3 and Pb(N3)2 have been found to undergo phase transitions at 2.6 GPa, although their high-pressure structures have still to be determined.",2011
Aerosol synthesis of energetic materials,"Aerosols are facile and convenient methods for preparing many types of materials. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) and chemical aerosol flow synthesis (CAFS) are two examples of aerosol synthesis techniques that have opened up new opportunities for nanostructured materials with diverse applications including electronics, spintronics, energy, and biology. USP and CAFS use ultrasound directed through liquid precursors to the surface where capillary wave action from the ultrasound results in the formation of fine droplets (diameters < 5 μm). A photograph of ultrasonic nebulization of water is shown in Figure 1a. As shown in Figure 1b and 1c, the droplets are carried into a heated furnace where they undergo various reactions, and the products are collected by bubblers or other particle collectors (e.g. cyclonic, electrostatic, etc). Using these techniques submicrometer particles and nanoparticles of metals, metal nitrides, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and carbon with novel applications and morphologies have been produced. Energetic materials such as finely divided aluminum have long been and continue to be of significant interest due the high heat of reaction to form aluminum oxide: 31 kJ/g. There has been an upsurge of interest in submicrometer morphologies of Al for use in high energy nanocomposites (i.e., nanothermite and other highly energetic mixtures for explosives or propellants) and for use in hydrogen storage. Using a modified CAFS process, hollow metallic aluminum particles were prepared (Figure 2). Numerous other metals have been prepared previously using aerosol processes, but this is the first time a metal with a reduction potential more negative than hydrogen has been produced without starting with the metal initially. Solutions of trimethylamine aluminum hydride (TMAH) in toluene were nebulized into a gas stream containing TiCl 4 , which catalyzes the decomposition of the TMAH into metallic aluminum. Characterization revealed the product to consist of hollow agglomerates of aluminum nanoparticles. Macroporous shells were created when the aerosol was heated to 100 °C, and transitioned to nonporous shells when heated to 200 °C. For the nonporous particles, traces of the TiCl 4 catalyst were trapped inside the particles. The prepared aluminum particles were found to be oxide passivated in spite of rigorous efforts to exclude oxygen from the system. The active aluminum content of the particles was measured using a previously reported redox titration method. The particles were found to consist of 72 wt% and 85 wt% active aluminum for particles prepared at 100 and 200 °C, respectively, even after storage at 22 °C and 30% RH for 5 months. A significant drawback to the use of metallic aluminum in energetic materials applications is that no significant amount of expansion gases is generated when reacted in nanothermites. Aluminum carbide, Al 4 C 3 , is a hard ceramic material with few reports in the literature, and no applications to date. It was found that nanoparticles of Al 4 C 3 could be synthesized by the pyrolysis of trialkyl aluminum precursors, and that these nanoparticles were passivated by a layer of amorphous carbon which protected the surface against oxidation unlike previous reports. The size of the nanoparticles could be increased from ~ 80 nm up to 250 nm by increasing the vapor pressure of the precursor, and the thickness of the amorphous carbon layer could be increased from 5 nm up to 15 nm by increasing the furnace temperature from 900 to 1100 °C. The Al 4 C 3 nanoparticles were investigated in energetic materials applications by combining them with metal oxides to form metastable intermolecular composites (MICS). The nanoparticles show excellent brisance when reacted in a flame, and could be a useful energetic material due to the formation of permanent expansion gases (CO or CO 2 ) when reacted.",2010
Anisotropic decomposition of energetic materials,"Using a white x-ray synchrotron beam, we have dynamically studied radiation-induced decomposition in single crystalline PETN and TATB. By monitoring the integrated intensity of selected diffraction spots via a CCD x-ray camera as a function of time, we have found that the decomposition rate varies dramatically depending upon the orientation of the crystalline axes relative to polarized x-ray beam and for differing diffracting conditions (spots) within the same crystalline orientation. We suggest that this effect is due to Compton scattering of the polarized x-rays with electron clouds that is dependent upon their relative orientation. This novel effect may yield valuable insight regarding anisotropic detonation sensitivity in energetic materials such as PETN.",2007
Additive manufacturing of energetic materials: Tailoring energetic performance via printing,"Additive manufacturing (AM), also called three-dimensional (3D) printing, has been developed to obtain energetic materials within the past decade. 3D printing represents a family of flexible manufacturing techniques that enable fast and accurate fabrication of structures with complex 3D features and a broad range of sizes, from submicrometer to several meters. Various methods have already been explored, including templating, melting extrusion, inkjet printing and electrospray methods. It was demonstrated that the structure achieved by AM could be used to manipulate the reactivity of energetic or reactive materials by changing the flow of gases and entrained particles via architecture. By employing different AM techniques, energetic materials with controllable nanostructures and uniformly dispersed ingredients can be prepared. It is exciting to tailor the energy release without defaulting to change the formulation of the conventional method. The combustion and mechanical properties of conventional energetic materials can be retained at the same time. In this review, the preparation and characterization of AM energetic materials that have been developed in the last decade are summarized. Various AM techniques used in the fabrication of energetic materials are compared and discussed. In particular, formulations of energetic materials applied in AM, metallic fuels, binders and energetic fillers and their advantages in terms of combustion efficiency and other properties are proposed. ?? 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.",2022
"Functional energetic materials: Simple preparation of fluorinated materials to improve safety, preservation and energy release performance of energetic materials","Paraffin wax (PW) coatings are widely used in the military as the most effective way to reduce the sensitivity of energetic materials, but their inert nature is not conducive to energy release. In this work, paraffin -like fluorinecontaining molecules (FPW) which are highly anticipated on a large scale were synthesized by combining crystalline units with fluorine units via a simple method. Core -shell Al@FPW was prepared for further characterization. FPW exhibits better lubrication and greater density (1.14 g/cm 3 vs. 0.81 g/cm 3 ) than PW, which can provide favorable guarantees for reduced friction sensitivity and increased energy density. The similar melting temperatures and crystallization enthalpies (168 J/g vs. 201 J/g) of FPW and PW are advantageous for mitigating the temperature sensitivity of nano -Al. Furthermore, the improved hydrophobicity of Al@FPW prevents further oxidation of the active metal, thereby enhancing the preservation of nano -Al. Moreover, the reaction process of Al@FPW was characterized by DSC-Tg. Notably, the combustion pressure, pressurization rate and calorific value of Al@FPW are significantly increased compared to Al@PW. Meanwhile, the ignition delay time is reduced by 83 % and the combustion rate is increased by 330 %, which is attributed to the action of fluorine during the reaction. The exceptional performance of FPW holds great potential for replacing PW in various applications.",2024
"Nitrogen-Rich Energetic 1,2,5-Oxadiazole-Tetrazole - Based Energetic Materials","Research for new energetic materials with tailored properties is of particular interest in many research groups. In order to meet challenging requirements heterocyclic systems have been investigated. One of the most promising area of research is synthesis of high nitrogen content compounds. Connection of highly endothermic moieties within one molecule attracted attention in recent time. The combination of nitrogen rich tetrazole and tetrazole oxides with oxygen containing furazan and furoxan is a new trend in synthesis of energetic materials with appropriate oxygen balance, high density, and good thermal stability. Various salts have been obtained in order to improve properties in comparison to covalent energetic materials. In this paper results in a recent research for nitrogen rich compounds containing 1,2,5-oxadiazole-tetrazoles species are presented.",2015
Nitroxy- and azidomethyl azofurazans as advanced energetic materials,"Progress in the rocket industry is only possible on the basis of new, higher performance and more environmentally friendly materials compared to up-to-date propellant ingredients for liquid, solid, gelled and hybrid propellant systems. In this work, synthetic methods have been developed for the preparation of new energetic azofurazans bearing nitroxymethyl or azidomethyl groups. All prepared compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies, as well as elemental analyses. An analysis of the structural features based on the X-ray single-crystal diffraction made it possible to discuss their influence on the densities of the azofurazans of this study. Thermal decomposition and combustion of nitroxymethyl and azidomethyl azofurazans were studied using a number of complementary experimental techniques, namely thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, manometry, microthermocouple measurements in the combustion wave. The structural and physical characteristics of these new energetic analogues illustrate the extent to which the nature of the explosophoric groups can be used to tune the performace of the azofurazan framework. These azofurazans possess positive calculated enthalpy of formation and are promising candidates for new environmentally friendly energetic materials.(c) 2022 China Ordnance Society.

Electricity-heat response of energetic materials,"Transient pulse testing (TPT) is a kind of non-destructive testing technique that can be used to obtain the electro-thermal response of initiators by applying a considerable low current to them. During the testing progress, it is important to ensure that the mining detonators do not function. Thus, it is desirable to know the current-induced temperature increment of the bridgewire. In order to obtain the temperature increment of the bridgewire in the TPT, the simulation of this test is described in this paper. Based on the heat transfer theory, a three-dimensional model is built on the assumption that there is no chemical reaction. Considering the initial conditions and the boundary conditions, the influence of different heat loss factors, heat capacities of bridgewire and currents to the result is studied through the usage of software FlexPDE. Theoretical results are represented in figures. Those results show that this new model is better than model Rosenthal when considering the temperature distribution along the bridgewire.",2016
Energetic biocidal materials and spore neutralization,"The objective of this dissertation is to explore a more accurate and versatile approach to investigating the neutralization of spores suffered from ultrafast heating and biocide based stresses, and further to explore and understand novel methods to supply ultrafast heating and biocides through nanostructured energetic materials (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)",2015
Bionic inspired multifunctional modular energetic materials: an exploration of new generation of application-oriented energetic materials,"The balance between pertinence and universality of high value-added energetic materials has gained importance in recent years. Inspired by the efficient working mechanism of stem cells, an innovative energetic material concept, multifunctional modular energetic materials (MMEMs), with the ability of quantity production and multifunctional uses was first proposed. A machine learning-assisted high-throughput screening system was developed and applied to guide the discovery of MMEMs, and promising energetic compounds were rapidly targeted and synthesized. These compounds exhibited a satisfactory density, thermal properties, detonation performance and sensitivity. Furthermore, they can be easily synthesized to maintain the ""energetic stem cell pool"" and can undergo ""differentiation"" for functioning as various compounds such as crystal explosives, cast explosive carriers, energetic binders, and plasticizers through different processing forms/different formulae as needed. It is anticipated that the findings of this study will open up a new research direction of application-oriented energetic materials. Aiming to balance the pertinence and universality of energetic materials, this study proposes a new concept of bionic inspired multifunctional modular energetic materials and seeks out potential monomers via a high-throughput screening strategy.",2024
Molecular dynamics study of energetic materials,"This dissertation is focused on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of energetic materials. Energetic materials are a class of materials with high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released. Propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnic are typical classes of energetic materials. In the past decade, energetic materials have been playing very important roles in the fields of defense and other technologies, since they are secure, convenient and energetically compact, which will be continuously functionalized for further improvements indispensably in the new era. The significance of how to utilize the novel and promising features more profitably and constructively will necessitate fundamental understanding of dynamics of the material releasing energy through reactions. Among all kinds of energetic materials, aluminum nanostructures and high explosives are the subjects studied in this dissertation. For aluminum nanostructures, we have performed multimillion atom reactive MD simulations to investigate the oxidation dynamics of aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NPs), Al-NP aggregates, and aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs). For high explosives, we have addressed the shock-induced detonation of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX, an initialism for Research Department Explosive). The scientific interest in aluminum nanostructures research basically lies in the increased reactivity during oxidation as compared with conventional micro-sized structures. However, what is the size effect on the reactivities of the Al-NPs still puzzles researchers. Practically, Al-NPs commercially produced always have a thin oxide layer encapsulating the pure metal particles. The oxide shell has been included in all our simulated aluminum nanostructures to accurately represent the reality as much as possible. We have systematically simulated different sizes of single Al-NPs (diameter, D = 26, 36 and 46 nm) to study their reactivities in oxygen environments as isolated individuals. We have also systematically extended our study to their assemblies – Al-NP aggregates with different sizes in oxygen environments. Aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs), a different type of morphology, also have been investigated due to their high contact areas with oxidizers. Our MD simulations reveal, within the range of our studied cases, the smaller sizes of aluminum nanostructures have higher reactivities ( e.g., faster reaction rate, shorter reaction time and faster oxidation speed). Meanwhile, our atomistic analyses show interesting and unexpected roles of the interfaces of the oxide shell with aluminum and oxygen environment during the initial oxidation. In addition, the processes of final product formation show the evolution of different major intermediate species. Such atomistic understanding of the interface, reaction pathways and the size effect should have profound impacts on the design of the efficient burning of intermolecular products. The second topic of this dissertation is the detonation of a high explosive, RDX. Despite many years of intense research, atomistic mechanisms underlying the reaction time and intermediate reaction products of detonating high explosives have been elusive. Our reactive MD simulations reveal a novel two-stage reaction mechanism during the detonation of RDX crystal. Rapid production of N 2 and H 2 O is followed by delayed production of CO molecules. We have found that further decomposition towards the final products is inhibited by the formation of large, metastable carbon- and oxygen-rich clusters. Such atomistic understanding may pave a way toward rational design for detonation synthesis of materials.",2014
Explosive risk criterion for energetic materials,The theoretical basis of laboratory shock sensitivity test procedures (methods of critical energies and critical pressures) of energetic materials is given.

Computational modelling of multi-material energetic materials and systems,"In this paper, we present a systematic roadmap for developing a robust and parallel multi-material reactive hydrodynamic solver that integrates historically stable algorithms with new and current modern methods to solve explosive system design problems. The Ghost Fluid Method and Riemann solvers were used to enforce appropriate interface boundary conditions. Improved performance in terms of computational work and convergence properties was achieved by modifying a local node sorting strategy that decouples ghost nodes, allowing us to set material boundary conditions via an explicit procedure, removing the need to solve a coupled system of equations numerically. The locality and explicit nature of the node sorting concept allows for greater levels of parallelism and lower computational cost when populating ghost nodes. Non-linear numerical issues endemic to the use of real Equations of State in hydro-codes were resolved by using more thermodynamically consistent forms allowing us to accurately resolve large density gradients associated with high energy detonation problems at material interfaces. Pre-computed volume tables were implemented adding to the robustness of the solver base.",2020
Nanochargers: Energetic materials for energy storage,"Nanochargers are energetic materials consisting of fuel metal particles and metallic oxide particles that absorb and store energy up to an ignition threshold. Once ignited a controlled exothermic reaction ensues producing energy. Nanotechnology has spurred the understanding of unique nanoparticle combustion behaviors that enable creation of nanochargers with optimized heat capacity for storing energy. Although in the initial stages, these experiments demonstrate evidence of the nanocharger's potential for energy storage and transfer. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Chemical bonding in energetic materials: beta-NTO.,"The electron density and related properties of the quasi-stable beta form of 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (NTO; space group P2(1)/c) have been determined from a low-temperature [100 (1) K] X-ray diffraction experiment. Intensities were measured with a 2K CCD Bruker diffractometer using Ag Kalpha radiation. Two detector settings, several varphi settings, 0.3 degrees omega scans and 160 s exposure time per frame gave R(int) = 0.0215 for 68 989 (4080 unique) reflections and (sin straight theta/lambda)(max) = 1.23 A(-1). The Hansen-Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1978), A34, 909-921] multipole model as implemented in the XD program gave R = 0.0333 (all reflections), which allowed calculation of the electron density, Laplacian and electrostatic potential distributions. The bonding (3,-1) critical points and the molecular dipole moment of 3.2 (1) D were also obtained. Chemical bonding in the molecule is discussed.",-Jun
Nonlinear Electromagnetic Interactions in Energetic Materials,"We study the scattering of electromagnetic waves in anisotropic energetic materials. Nonlinear light-matter interactions in molecular crystals result in frequency-conversion and polarization changes. Applied electromagnetic fields of moderate intensity can induce these nonlinear effects without triggering chemical decomposition, offering a mechanism for the nonionizing identification of explosives. We use molecular-dynamics simulations to compute such two-dimensional THz spectra for planar slabs made of pentaerythritol tetranitrate and ammonium nitrate. We discuss third-harmonic generation and polarization-conversion processes in such materials. These observed far-field spectral features of the reflected or transmitted light may serve as an alternative tool for standoff explosive detection.",2016
Development of Electrically Controlled Energetic Materials,"U.S. Army ARDEC has been examining a novel pyroelectric-type material developed by Digital Solid State Propulsion, LLC for its unique combustion properties and insensitivity. This unique ECEM is formed using an ionic liquid oxidizer and polymer fuel, via sol-gel processes and is quite dense, making it very suitable for energetic applications in both the civilian and military fields. This ECEM is completely insensitive to the application of impact, flame, friction, and shock threats. Once a power of the required voltage is applied, the baseline ECEM rapidly initiates combustion with H2O, CO2, and N-2 formed as the only major gas phase products produced. Initial testing of ECEM in perforated pipes appears promising as indicated by uniform ignition along the entire length of the test assembly.",2013
THERMAL DAMAGE CHARACTERIZATION OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"We conducted thermal damage experiments at 180 degrees C on PBXN-9 and characterized its material properties. Volume expansion at high temperatures was very significant which led to a reduction in material density. 2.6% of weight loss was observed, which was higher than other HMX-based formulations. Porosity of PBXN-9 increased to 16% after thermal exposure. Small-scale safety tests (impact, friction, and spark) showed no significant sensitization when the damaged samples were tested at room temperature. Gas permeation measurements showed that gas permeability in damaged materials was several orders of magnitude higher than that in pristine materials. In-situ measurements of gas permeability and density were proved to be possible at higher temperatures.",2009
Synthesis and evaluation of energetic materials,"Over the years new generations of propellants and explosives are being developed. High performance and pollution prevention issues have become the subject of interest in recent years. Desired properties of these materials are a halogen-free, nitrogen and oxygen rich molecular composition with high density and a positive heat of formation. The dinitramide anion is a new oxy anion of nitrogen and forms salts with variety of metal, organic and inorganic cations. Particular interest is in ammonium dinitramide (ADN, NH 4 N(NO 2 ) 2 ) which is a potentially useful energetic oxidizer. ADN is considered as one of the most promising substitutes for ammonium perchlorate (AP, NH 4 ClO 4 ) in currently used composite propellants. It is unique among energetic materials in that it has no carbon or chlorine; its combustion products are not detrimental to the atmosphere. Unquestionable advantage of ADN over AP is the significant improvement in the performance of solid rocket motors by 5-15%. The present thesis is centered on the experimental results along with discussion of some of the most pertinent aspects related to the synthesis and characterization of few dinitramide salts. The chemistry, mechanism and kinetics of the formation of dinitramide salts by nitration of deactivated amines are investigated. The evaluation of the thermal and spectral properties along with the adsorption and thermal decomposition characteristics of the dinitramide salts are also explored in this thesis.",2005
Sensitivity and Performance of Energetic Materials,"This paper provides an overview of the main developments over the past nine years in the study of the sensitivity of energetic materials (EM) to impact, shock, friction, electric spark, laser beams, and heat. Attention is also paid to performance and to its calculation methods. Summaries are provided of the relationships between sensitivity and performance, the best representations for the calculation methods of performance being the volume heat of explosion or the product of crystal density and the square of detonation velocity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is possible to state that a single universal relationship between molecular structure and initiation reactivity does not yet exist. It is confirmed that increasing the explosive strength is usually accompanied by an increase in the sensitivity. In the case of nitramines this rule is totally valid for friction sensitivity, but for impact sensitivity there are exceptions to the rule, and with 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazepane, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane, beta-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane, and the alpha-, beta- and epsilon-polymorphs of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane the relationship works in the opposite direction. With respect to the QSPR approach there might be reasonably good predictions but it provides little insight into the physics and chemistry involved in the process of initiation.",2016
Piezoelectric Ignition of Nanocomposite Energetic Materials,"Piezoelectric initiators are a unique form of ignition for energetic material because the current and voltage are tied together by impact loading on the crystal. This study examines the ignition response of an energetic composite composed of aluminum and molybdenum trioxide nanopowders to the arc generated from a lead zirconate and lead titanate piezocrystal. The mechanical stimuli used to activate the piezocrystal varied to assess ignition voltage, power, and delay time of aluminum-molybdenum trioxide for a range of bulk powder densities. Results show a high dielectric strength leads to faster ignition times because of the higher voltage delivered to the energetic. Ignition delay is under 0.4ms, which is faster than observed with thermal or shock ignition. Electric ignition of composite energetic materials is a strong function of interparticle connectivity, and thus the role of bulk density on electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity is a focus of this study. Results show that the ignition delay times are dependent on the powder bulk density with an optimum bulk density of 50%. Packing fractions and electrical conductivity were analyzed and aid in explaining the resulting ignition behavior as a function of bulk density.",2014
HIGH-PRESSURE STUDIES OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"High-pressure studies of energetic materials provide valuable information about how these compounds behave under the extreme conditions experienced during detonation.

Laser-induced reactions in energetic materials,"Several energetic materials have been investigated under shock wave loading, heating, and photodissociation. This dissertation highlights some efforts to understand energetic material from an angle of basic physical processes and elementary chemical reactions. The first series of experiments was performed to study laser-generated shock waves in energetic materials. Shock waves are generated by pulsed laser vaporization of thin aluminum films. The rapidly expanding aluminum plasma launches a shock wave into the adjacent layer of energetic material, initiating chemical reactions. The shock velocity has been measured by a velocity interferometer. Shock pressures as high as 8 GPa have been generated in this manner. A simple model is proposed to predict laser-generated shock pressure. Several energetic materials have been studied under laser-generated shock wave. The second series of experiments was conducted to study thermal decomposition and photodissociation of energetic materials. Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) and poly(glycidyl nitrate) (PGN) have been investigated by pulsed infrared laser pyrolysis and ultraviolet laser photolysis of thin films at 17–77 K. Reactions are monitored by transmission infrared spectroscopy. Photolysis of GAP at 266 nm shows that the initial reaction steps are elimination of molecular nitrogen with subsequent formation of imines. Thermal decomposition of GAP by infrared laser pyrolysis reveals products similar to the UV experiments after warming. Laser pyrolysis of PGN indicated that the main steps of decomposition are elimination of NO 2 and CH 2 O from the nitrate ester functional group. It seems that the initial thermal decomposition mechanism of GAP and PGN are the same from heating rate of several degrees per second to 10 7 o C/s. The third series of experiments is about detailed study of photodissociation mechanism of methyl nitrate. Photodissociation of methyl nitrate isolated in an argon matrix at 17 K has been investigated by 266 nm laser photolysis. Characterization of the product species has been performed by transmission infrared spectroscopy. There are two parallel initial reaction channels, one of which is formation of formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and hydrogen nitryl (HNO 2 ). The second channel is formation of formaldehyde and a previously unreported species, imine peroxide (HNOO). Quantum chemical calculations of the structure, vibrational frequencies and infrared band intensities have been performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G**, MP2(full)/6-311++G**, and QCISD/6-311++G** levels of theory. The calculated vibrational frequency patterns allowed us to confirm the detection and infrared spectral assignments of imine peroxide for the first time.",1999
Extreme Energetic Materials at Ultrahigh Pressures,"Owing to their extremely high energy density, single-bonded polymeric nitrogen and atomic metallic hydrogen are generally regarded as the ultimate energetic materials. Although their syntheses normally require ultrahigh pressures of several hundred gigapascals (GPa), which prohibit direct materials application, research on their stability, metastability, and fundamental properties are valuable for seeking extreme energetic materials through alternative synthetic routes. Various crystalline and amorphous polymeric nitrogens have been discovered between 100 and 200 GPa. Metastability at ambient conditions has been demonstrated for some of these phases. Cubic-gauche and black-phosphorus polymorphs of single-bonded nitrogen are two particularly interesting phases. Their large hystereses warrant further application-inspired basic research of nitrogen. In contrast, although metallic hydrogen contains the highest-estimated energy density, its picosecond lifetime and picogram quantity make its practical material application impossible at present. Metallic hydrogen remains a curiosity-driven basic research pursuit focusing on the pressure-induced evolution of the molecular hydrogen crystal and its electronic band structure from a low-density insulator with a very wide electronic band gap to a semiconductor with a narrow gap to a dense molecular metal and atomic metal and eventually to a previously unknown exotic state of matter. This great experimental challenge is driving relentless advancement in ultrahigh-pressure science and technology. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Nitrogen-rich tricyclic-based energetic materials,"The chemistry of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) featuring multiple nitrogen-rich heterocyclic skeletons with energetic fragments has witnessed enormous growth since the process of manufacturing explosives successfully was improved by Alfred Nobel. In particular, the recent surge of interest in HEDMs is because of its wide application in the military and civilian fields. In this review, we provide a systematic introduction to the developments in heterocyclic nitrogen-rich energetic materials with various explosive groups in the form of tricyclic-based compounds. This review summarizes the recent efforts toward new HEDMs based on the synthetic route, crystal behavior and the structure-property relationship.

Electrochemical Synthesis of High-Nitrogen Materials and Energetic Materials,"Electrochemical synthesis is a valuable method for the preparation of molecules. It is innately eco-friendly, as potentially hazardous oxidation and reduction agents are replaced with electrochemical potentials. Electrochemistry is commonly applied globally in the synthesis of numerous chemicals, but the energetic materials field lags in this regard. In this review, we endeavor to cover the entire history of synthetic electrochemistry for the preparation of energetic materials and detail the electrochemical transformations of high-nitrogen materials that are relevant for the preparation of new energetic molecules. We hope this review serves as a starting point to inform those involved in synthetic energetic materials chemistry, and those interested in other applications of high-nitrogen molecules, about the environmentally friendly electrochemical methods available for such compounds.",2022
High-pressure studies of energetic materials,"Although high pressure has been used extensively to study a range of materials that include metals, minerals, and ices, a class of material that has received rather less attention is energetic materials (explosives, propellants). The work presented has used high-pressure techniques to investigate polymorphism in energetic materials. Novel-high pressure phases of RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine or cyclonite) and ammonium perchlorate are reported, which have both been structurally characterised using single-crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction. Of particular importance has been the successful determination of the structure of the elusive high-pressure –form of RDX. Equations of state for both polymorphs of both compounds have been determined. High-pressure measurements of HMX (cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine or octogen) revealed no phase transitions up to 8.46 GPa. An equation of state up to this pressure has been determined. Crystallisation of HMX from DMSO at 0.1 GPa gives a 1:2 HMX-DMSO solvate which has been structurally characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The high-pressure behaviour of TATP (triacetone triperoxide) has been explored. Hydroxylammonium perchlorate has been investigated using high-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder neutron diffraction, and a high-temperature phase has been fully structurally characterised for the first time. High-pressure studies of hydroxylammonium perchlorate indicate the presence of two new polymorphs. High-pressure measurements have been conducted on ammonium nitrate up to 7.85 GPa, showing no phase transitions. An equation of state has been determined over this pressure range. Studies have also been undertaken on the simple molecular compound thiourea dioxide. Two new high-pressure phases have been identified and structurally characterised using both single-crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction.",2008
Shock interactions with heterogeneous energetic materials,"The complex physical phenomenon of shock wave interaction with material heterogeneities has significant importance and nevertheless remains little understood. In many materials, the observed macroscale response to shock loading is governed by characteristics of the microstructure. Yet, the majority of computational studies aimed at predicting phenomena affected by these processes, such as the initiation and propagation of detonation waves in explosives or shock propagation in geological materials, employ continuum material and reactive burn model treatment. In an effort to highlight the grain-scale processes that underlie the observable effects in an energetic system, a grain-scale model for hexanitrostilbene (HNS) has been developed. The measured microstructures were used to produce synthetic computational representations of the pore structure, and a density functional theory molecular dynamics derived equation of state (EOS) was used for the fully dense HNS matrix. The explicit inclusion of the microstructure along with a fully dense EOS resulted in close agreement with historical shock compression experiments. More recent experiments on the dynamic reaction threshold were also reproduced by inclusion of a global kinetics model. The complete model was shown to reproduce accurately the expected response of this heterogeneous material to shock loading. Mesoscale simulations were shown to provide a clear insight into the nature of threshold behavior and are a way to understand complex physical phenomena. Published by AIP Publishing.",2018
Interactions of polymers and energetic materials,"Trace explosive detection is the primary way for quick and easy sampling of various surfaces in a check-point environment, e.g. an airport. The swabs used for commercial explosive detectors, such as ion mobility spectrometers, are made of various materials. The difficulty in collection and analysis of explosive traces is that the swabs must be effective at adsorbing as well as desorbing materials, i.e. pickup from the surface and release into the detection device. This dichotomy results in a tradeoff for development of new swabs. Generally, desorption is considered to be the more desirable property; therefore, Teflon is one choice for commercial swabs. It would be ideal to develop a swab with both enhanced adsorption and desorption. One way to accomplish this is to apply an electrostatic charge to commercial swabs. This enhances their attraction to explosive particles, but once the swab is placed in the inlet of commercial detection instrument, the charge is dissipated, and desorption of the particles into the instrument proceeds as usual. Methods of generating electrostatically charge swabs was determined; triboelectric charging vs corona charging was compared examining magnitude of the charge, reproducibility and stability, and effects of humidity. The magnitude of charge necessary for enhanced collection of particles was evaluated using an electrostatic voltmeter to measure charge and various means to measure particle pickup. Corona charging was determined to be more effective. Enhancement of collection was judged by comparing results of corona charging swabs to those achieved by contact swabbing. Two variables were examined: the analyte and the substrate from which the analyte is removed. The swab material was Nomex. In each case but three, collection of an analyte by an electrostatically enhanced swab outperformed the traditional contact swabbing. Evaluation was determined by a rigorous quantification by mass spectrometry of the analyte picked up by the swab and the analyte remaining on the substrate after swabbing. When analytical protocol was not amenable to a particular analyte or substrate a commercial explosive trace detection instrument was used. It was found that the substrate morphology played a bigger role in pickup of analyte than the particular analyte. In order to eliminate biological warfare agents, both heat and halides are used. Ideally, these agents would be destroyed without dispersing them. The approach to create a polymeric-sprayable matrix would allow dispersion of an iodine-producing pyrotechnic, without dispersing the biological weapon, and when initiated would produce both heat and iodine gas. This matrix will provide iodine vapor and a long-lasting flame, not an explosion, to control dispersion of the threat. A two-part foam was formulated based on polyurethane chemistry, i.e. a diisocyanate combined with polyol to produce a urethane linkage. Each component of the foam (e.g. isocyanate, polyol, catalyst, blowing agent, surfactant) was experimentally adjusted to achieve the best foam based on expansion, structural integrity, and cell uniformity. Since the polyol is the most adjustable component in the foam, an investigation of commercial and synthesized energetic polyols was performed. The structures of the energetic polyols were verified by LC-MS and FTIR and characterized for heat flow by DSC. Once the structures of the energetic polyols had been proven, it was formulated into a polyurethane foam which was characterized for heat of decomposition, by SDT, for heat of combustion by bomb calorimetry, and structurally by FTIR. Documenting heat flow with SDT helped to determine that the structural modification increased heat release and lowered ignition temperature compared to the standard polyurethane foam. The formulated polyurethane foam was then tested for expansion against increased solids loading. When optimal solids loading was determined (>70%), the pyrotechnic foam was ignited in a bomb calorimeter. The heat released and iodine production was quantified.",2017
Dendrite growth of energetic material RDX,"1, 3, 5-trinitro-1, 3, 5-triazacyclohexane (C3H6N6O6, RDX) with different dendrite morphologies has been prepared under the non-equilibrium state through re-crystallization on glass substrates. Different growth models of RDX crystals have been induced by the saturation degree of solution and additive. The growth processes are captured and investigated using in situ observations. A possible mechanism has been proposed to explain the formation of RDX dendrite. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2012
The laser ignition of energetic materials,"This dissertation describes research performed to further the current understanding of the laser diode ignition and subsequent burn of energetic materials. It constitutes a comprehensive investigation of the fundamental processes involved in the operation of laser ignited explosive devices - from the initial absorption of light, through the onset of ignition to completion of burn. The systems under study utilised GaAlAs near infra-red laser diodes, emitting at around 820nm, to generate pulses of optical energy (1-100ms in duration and up to 2W). The energy was transmitted to the energetic material by silica optical fibres with a core diameter of 100 m. The ignition of an energetic material by radiant energy is governed by a large number of complex processes. In order to simplify the investigation, the study of these processes was divided into three parts. First, the laser ignition thresholds of pressed HMX/carbon black samples were measured, to quantify their dependencies on factors such as explosive particle size distribution, carbon black concentration and laser pulse attributes. The existence of critical minimum powers and energies to achieve ignition (in a given system) was demonstrated and discussed. Second, the near infra-red optical properties of these energetic compositions were characterised at laser power levels too low to cause decomposition, providing an insight into how much of the incident optical energy is absorbed and in what volume. The influences of carbon concentration, HMX particle size distribution, sample density and crystal damage were evaluated. Finally, descriptive/predictive numerical models were developed, to reconcile the measured optical properties and ignition threshold characteristics, identify the dominant energy transfer paths, and quantify heat dissipation. The remaining research addressed the explosive burn following ignition. One area of particular interest is the pressure build up within a system utilising a laser ignited charge. Initial investigations into this field have been completed.",1997
Crystal Structure Prediction of Energetic Materials,"The synthesis and experimental testing of energetic materialscanbe hazardous, but their many industrial and military applicationsnecessitate their constant research and development. We evaluate computationalmethods for predicting the crystal structures of energetic molecularorganic crystals from their molecular structure as a first step incomputationally evaluating materials, which could guide experimentalwork. Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is evaluated on a test setof 10 energetic materials with known crystal structures, initiallyusing a rigid-molecule, anisotropic atom-atom force-field approach,followed by reoptimization of predicted crystal structures using dispersion-correctedsolid-state density functional theory (DFT). CSP using the force fieldwas found to provide good results for some molecules, whose knowncrystal structures are reproduced by one of the lowest-energy predictions,but are more variable than typical results for other small organic molecules. Reoptimization of predictedcrystal structures using solid-state DFT leads to reliable predictions,demonstrating CSP as an approach that can be applied in the area ofenergetic materials discovery and development. The performance of crystal structureprediction methodsis assessed on a set of 10 molecular organic energetic materials,demonstrating that these methods are sufficiently reliable to be usedfor the design of new energetic materials.",2023

Coating and Characterization of Energetic Materials,"This project develops a method of manufacturing Plastic Bonded Explosives by using use precision control of agglomeration and coating of energetic powders. The energetic material coating process entails suspending either wet or dry energetic powders in a stream of inert gas and contacting the energetic powder with atomized droplets of a lacquer composed of binder and organic solvent. By using a high velocity air stream to pneumatically convey the energetic powders and droplets of lacquer, the energetic powders are efficiently wetted while agglomerate drying begins almost immediately. The result is an energetic powder uniformly coated with binder; i.e., a PBX, with a high bulk density suitable for pressing. Experiments have been conducted using mock explosive materials to examine coating effectiveness and density. Energetic materials are now being coated and will be tested both mechanically and thermally. This allows for a comprehensive comparison of the morphology and reactivity of the newly coated materials to previously manufactured materials.",2012
Manufacturing and characterization of energetic materials,"Few products take several years of research effort to be synthesize yet disintegrate in scarcely millionths of a second when used. Despite their short lifespan energetic materials, particularly high explosives, are in demand as never before by the Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Gas, Mining, and Oil Industry for their unique properties. One class of high explosives known as polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) are popularly used in a wide variety of applications ranging from solid rocket propellants to the main explosive charge in conventional ammunitions. A key characteristic behind the popularity of PBXs in comparison to other high explosives is their handling safety. This characteristic of the PBXs has its root in its composition. Polymer bonded explosives are comprised of two different constituent materials: micron size energetic crystals and polymer binder material. The polymer binder material cohere the energetic crystal together into a single mass. In addition, the polymer binder material prevents friction between the energetic crystals and allows deformation. This characteristic of PBXs makes them safer to handle than any other class of high explosive. Is important to keep in mind that the particular behavior of the constituent materials will dictate the mechanical properties of the PBX. Polymer bonded explosives have a high demand for research development among industry due to the unexplained phenomena that occurs on the mechanical response regime. Interest in the mechanical response of PBXs continues to rise as applications for these continue to evolve. Characterizing the mechanical properties of a PBX is not an easy task in terms of security. This is due to user and equipment safety. Despite the fact the PBXs are safer to handle than any other high explosive, it is not advised to conduct mechanical testing on a real PBX. In order to characterize the mechanical properties of a PBX safely is imperative to adapt a “mock” PBX. A mock PBX has the ability to reproduce the mechanical behavior of a PBX closely without the risk of detonation. In this thesis, a new manufacturing method for a mock PBX named Miner mock will be covered. Quasi-static uniaxial compression, indirect tensile test, and semi-circular bending were carried out to extract the compressive, tensile, and fracture properties of the Miner mock. This mechanical properties will be compared to a real PBX formulation in order to provide validation to the new manufacturing method and the Miner mock formulation",2016
Multiscale Modeling of Crystalline Energetic Materials.,"The large discrepancy in length and time scales at which characteristic processes of energetic materials are of relevance pose a major challenge for current simulation techniques. We present a systematic study of crystalline energetic materials of different sensitivity and analyze their properties at different theoretical levels. Information like equilibrium structures, vibrational frequencies, conformational rearrangement and mechanical properties like stiffness and elastic properties can be calculated within the density functional theory (DFT) using different levels of approximations. Dynamical properties are obtained by computations using molecular dynamics at finite temperatures through the use of classical force fields. Effect of defects on structure is studied using classical molecular dynamics methods. Temperature induced reactions at elevated temperatures have been studied using ab initio molecular dynamics method for moderate size crystals of nitroethane. Furthermore, while presenting the state of the art in the study of modeling energetic materials, the current advances in the area as well as the limitations of each methodology are discussed.",2010
"Energetic materials containing fluorine. Design, synthesis and testing of furazan-containing energetic materials bearing a pentafluorosulfanyl group","The advantageous impact of a pentafluorosulfanyl substituent on the properties of furazan-containing energetic materials was demonstrated by the synthesis and study of the energetic properties of ten new compounds. The thermal stability of these compounds was evaluated by DSC and TGA, whereas densities, heats of formation, pressures of detonation and speeds of detonation were obtained computationally. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that the combination of the SF5 substituent with the furazan ring led to materials of higher density and predicted detonation properties than other known furazans or SF5-containing materials. In addition, the synthetic studies provided insight regarding the electron-withdrawing nature of the furazan ring, in particular its effect on the basicity and nucleophilic reactivity of amino furazans.

Computational studies on energetic properties of nitrogen-rich energetic materials with ditetrazoles,"Based on the full optimized molecular geometric structures at B3LYP/6-311++G**level, the densities (rho), heats of formation (HOFs), detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) for a series of ditetrazoles derivatives, were investigated to look for high energy density materials (HEDMs). The results show that the influence of different substituted groups on HOFs has the order of -N-3>-CN>-NH2>-NO2>-NF2>-ONO2>-H>-CH3>-CF3. The introduction of -CF3 groups is more favourable for increasing the density and the introduction of -CH3 groups is not favourable for increasing the density. In addition, all the series combined with -NF2 group except B-NF2 all have higher densities, larger D and P. F-NF2 may be regarded as the potential candidates of HEDMs because of the largest detonation velocity and pressure among these derivatives.The energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO of the studied compounds are also investigated.",2014
"2-Tetrazene Derivatives as New Energetic Materials; Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties","The oxidation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine with aqueous monochloramine yielded (E)-1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-2-tetrazene (1) as a pale yellow liquid with hypergolic properties. 1 can be oxidized with potassium permanganate to form (E)-1-formyl-1,4,4-trimethy1-2-tetrazene (2) and (E)-1,4-diformyl-1,4-dimethyl-2-tetrazene (3). Additionally, 1 reacts with a diethyl ether solution of monochloramine to form a stable 1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-2-tetrazenium chloride salt (4). The chloride in salt 4 was exchanged with various energetic anions, such as nitrate (5), perchlorate (6), 5,5'-azobistetrazolate (7*6H(2)O), picrate (8) and azide (9). All materials were characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods and the solid state structures of compounds 2-8 were elucidated. Due to the energetic nature of these materials, they were submitted to friction and impact sensitivity tests and DSC analysis was used to assess their thermal stabilities. Furthermore, the heats of formation of compounds 2-8 were computed using quantum mechanical methods (CBS-4M) and their detonation parameters (pressure and velocity) and specific impulses were also calculated. Lastly, the 2-tetrazene derivatives presented here are of potential interest either as building blocks or as a new class of low toxicity, low sensitivity energetic materials.",2014

Compatibility of PNIMMO with some energetic materials,"The compatibility of poly(3-nitromethyl-3-methyloxetane) (PNIMMO) with some energetic materials are studied by using pressure DSC method in detail. Cyclotetramethylenetetranitroamine (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), nitrocellulose (NC), nitroglycerine (NG), N-nitrodihydroxyethylaminedinitrate (DINA), and aluminum powder (Al) are used as common energetic materials, and 3,4-dinitrofurzanfuroxan (DNTF), 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (TNAZ), hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 4,6-dinitro-5,7-diaminobenzenfuroxan (CL-14), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (DADNE), and 4-amino-5-nitro-1,2,3-triazole (ANTZ) are used as new energetic materials. The results show that the binary systems of PNIMMO with HMX, RDX, NC, NG, DINA, Al, CL-14 and DADNE are compatible, with TNAZ, CL-20 and ANTZ are slightly sensitive, and with DNTF is sensitive.",2012
FiniteVolume Methodfor the Launch Safety of Energetic Materials,"It is important to examine the ignition of energetic materials for launch safety. Given that there is a paucity of experimental tests, numerical simulations are important for analysing energetic materials. A computer program based on the finite volume method and viscoelastic statistical crack mechanics model is developed to study the ignition of energetic materials. The trends of temperature and stress of energetic materials subjected to projectile base pressure are studied by numerical examples. The results are compared with those in an extant study, which verified the correctness of the proposed method. Additionally, the relationships between the temperature increase and nonimpact ignition of energetic materials were analysed. The results show that when the temperature at the bottom of the explosive rises to a certain value, it will cause the explosive to ignite. This research has significance to the study of the base gap of explosives, and it provides a reference for launch safety evaluation of energetic materials.",2021
Fundamental properties and processes of energetic materials,"Energetic materials comprise a set of systems of tremendous technological importance. Besides helping shape landscapes to establish communications, they have been used to reach fuel reservoirs, deploy safety bags and prevent heart strokes. Understanding its behavior can help in attaining strategic and tactical superiority, and importantly, preserve lives of people who handle these materials. The large discrepancy in length and time scales at which characteristic processes of energetic materials are of relevance pose a major challenge for current simulation techniques. We present a systematic study of crystalline energetic materials of different sensitivity and analyze their properties at different theoretical levels. Equilibrium structures, vibrational frequencies, conformational rearrangement and mechanical properties can be calculated within the density functional theory and molecular dynamics at finite temperatures. We have found marked differences in the calculated properties in systems with ranging sensitivities. Reactions at elevated temperatures have been studied using ab initio molecular dynamics method for crystals of nitroethane. Furthermore, while presenting the state of the art of energetic materials modeling, the limitations of each methodology are also discussed. Prospective systems and an elasticity driven approach that can be applied to other type of materials is also presented.",2011
Silicon quantum dots for energetic material applications,"In its history as an energetic material, porous silicon has demonstrated flame speeds in excess of 3km s(-1), tunable combustion behavior, and high energy output, which in theory makes it a very attractive energetic system. In practice, its application within the field is limited by porous silicon's typical substrate-adhered form and caustic chemical processing requirements that limit how and when porous silicon is made. In this work, we have relieved porous silicon of these constraints by creating reactive silicon quantum dots from free-standing porous silicon films. The resulting material is composed of crystalline silicon nanoparticles with diameters as small as 2 nm that retain the chemical properties of the original films including the SiH2 termination layer. The fabricated silicon particles were characterized using FTIR Spectroscopy, TEM, and EDS for determining the size and the chemical composition. For testing as an energetic material fuel, porous silicon was mixed with an oft used oxidizer, sodium perchlorate. During open-channel combustion tests, silicon quantum dots mixed with sodium perchlorate demonstrated flame speeds over 2.5 km s(-1), while bomb calorimetry tests showed an average heat of combustion of 7.4 kJ g(-1). These results demonstrate the ability to retain the porous silicon material properties that allow for highly energetic material reactions to occur, despite the additional processing steps to create silicon quantum dots. This opens the door for the use of porous silicon in the bulk of the energetic material application space, much of which was previously limited due to the substrate-attached nature of typical porous silicon.",2018

Electron-Ion Coupling in Shocked Energetic Materials,"The magnitude and role of electronic excitations in shocked energetic materials are studied theoretically using quantum molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on the detonating primary explosive HN3 (hydrazoic acid), this work finds that the material transiently exhibits a high level of electronic excitation characterized by carrier densities in excess of 10(21) cm(-3), or one electronic excitation for every eight molecules. Electronic excitations enhance the kinetics of chemical decomposition by similar to 30%. The electronic heat capacity has a minor impact on the temperatures exhibited, on the order of 100 K. These simulations are performed using the self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method (SCC-DFTB) combined with a new modification of a multiscale computational scheme for simulation of the coupling between electrons and ions in shocked matter.",2012
A REVIEW OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"Explosives are employed extensively not only in military areas but also in civilian applications. There are many researchers working on the discovery of explosives. In recent years, synthetic and theoretical studies on polycyclic aromatic explosives have received significant interest. The present short review concentrates on the synthesis and some of the physico-chemical characteristics of energetic materials of the classes of tetraazapentalene, naphthalene, di-and tetraaza-naphthalene, pyrazolo-pyrazole, benzofuroxan, tetrazine and tetrazene derivatives as well as theoretical studies. A brief comment is also made on the emerging explosive concepts such as velocity of detonation, detonation pressure etc. The compounds in the review have the potential for subsequent applications in the area of energetic materials. Therefore, an endeavor is made to assemble the important contributions made by the various scientists in the area of energetic materials in this review.",2009
Equation of State for Energetic Structural Materials,"Current investigations of energetic structural materials involve shock-induced and shock-assisted chemical reactions in which complex physical processes are currently only elucidated by computational models of gas-gun experiments. The equation of state is one of the most important parts of the constitutive models incorporated into models that describe the processes in shock-induced and shock-assisted chemical reactions. Implementation of current methods typically requires simplifying assumptions in the mixture rules. In this paper, two new equation-of-state methods are proposed that 1) are used to physically interpret both homobaric and uniform-strain assumptions, 2) do not require mixture-averaged equation-of-state model parameters, and 3) do not have any restrictions on the form of constituent equation-of-state or pore-collapse model. The proposed methods are compared with other mixture equation-of-state methods, and cases in which the mixture is porous are demonstrated. Gas-gun experiments are simulated and compared with experimental data for a material with 2Al, Fe(2)O(3), 20 wt % Epon 828, and voids, in which the reaction initiation threshold was not reached. The simulation integrates conservation equations and momentum balance using a second-order finite volume scheme.",2009
Machine-Learning Assisted Screening of Energetic Materials,"In this work, machine learning (ML), materials informatics (MI), and thermochemical data are combined to screen potential candidates of energetic materials. To directly characterize energetic performance, the heat of explosion Delta H-e is used as the target property. The critical descriptors of cohesive energy, averaged over all constituent elements and the oxygen balance, are found by forward stepwise selection from a large number of possible descriptors. With them and a theoretically labeled Delta H-e training data set, a satisfactory surrogate ML model is trained. The ML model is applied to large databases ICSD and PubChem to predict Delta H-e. At the gross-level filtering by the ML model, 2732 molecular candidates based on carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (CHNO) with high Delta H-e values are predicted. Afterward, a fine-level thermochemical screening is carried out on the 2732 materials, resulting in 262 candidates with TNT equivalent power index P-e(TNT) greater than 1.5. Raising P-e(TNT) further to larger than 1.8, 29 potential candidates are found from the 2732 materials, all are new to the current reservoir of well-known energetic materials.",2020
Tailoring the physical properties of energetic materials,"Energetic materials are a class of material that have large amounts of chemical energy stored within their molecular structure. This energy is released upon decomposition, generally in the form of rapidly expanding, hot gases. They are therefore used for a wide range of applications such as; mining, military, and space exploration, and there is therefore a strong desire to improve the overall performance and safety of such materials. On account of reduced sensitivity to initiation by shock and impact, 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) is a potential replacement for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in melt-cast formulations for military applications. However, up to 15 % irreversible growth of DNAN has been previously observed upon thermal cycling and is a key reason why DNAN has not yet been universally accepted as a replacement for TNT. DNAN exhibits a complex system of polymorphism. One particular transition from DNAN-II to DNAN-III, which occurs at 266 K, has been observed in these studies to cause 8 - 10 % growth of DNAN-II pellets when temperature cycled for 30 cycles between 256 K and 276 K. What was even more concerning was the appearance of cracking of DNAN pellets after being temperature cycled. Doping the crystal structure of DNAN-II with related molecules, such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene or 2,4-dinitroaniline, was investigated in order to probe how steric and electronic factors affect the transition. The addition of varying amounts of 2,4-dinitroaniline suppressed this transition to varying extents and ultimately as low as 150 K with 10 mol% 2,4-dinitroaniline, and potentially eliminated entirely. This doped material has been designated as phase-stabilised DNAN (PS-DNAN). Temperature cycling of PS-DNAN was conducted over the same 256-276 K range, and this material showed no evidence of irreversible growth compared to undoped DNAN pellets, on account of suppression of the II-III transition. The production of PS-DNAN is therefore a possible route to avoiding problematic irreversible growth in DNAN formulations. Melt-casting of DNAN in a sealed environment consistently results in the metastable form-II, which has proven to be stable for in excess of 32 weeks. However, exposure to seeds of form-I, either via deliberate or accidental seeding, rapidly converted the material to the thermodynamically more stable form-I. This transition was accelerated by increasing temperature which rapidly converted pellets of DNAN-II to DNAN-I. When DNAN-I pellets were temperature cycled, they did not undergo a transition to form-III, and as a result did not illustrate irreversible growth. This presents another approach to avoiding problematic growth in DNAN-based materials. Whilst being one of the most widely used oxidisers in propellant formulations, ammonium perchlorate (AP) has several issues; the formation of porous ammonium perchlorate (PAP) can seriously affect the sensitivity of propellants, the hygroscopicity of AP makes handling and manufacture of formulations difficult, and spherical AP exhibits poor binding properties to the polymer binders used in propellant formulations. Several different approaches were taken to combat these issues. Co-crystallisation of AP was attempted in order to produce new AP co-crystals with reduced reactivity towards the formation of PAP. A theoretical based approach using COSMOtherm was used for rapid screening and selection of potential co-formers to be used in lab-based co-crystallisation trials. Co-crystallisation was attempted using multiple stoichiometries and multiple solvents by solvent evaporation, cooling crystallisation, and Resonant Acoustic Mixing methods. Unfortunately no new co-crystals were obtained, presumably on account of the ionic nature of AP which makes co-crystallisation difficult. The mass of untreated AP increased by 0.027% in a humid environment (90% RH) due to the uptake of water, which resulted in significant caking and hence hindering the processability of AP. In an attempt to counteract the hygroscopicity and improve the processability of AP, particles of AP were coated in graphene nanoplatelets using the technique of Resonant Acoustic Mixing. Low mixing energy (G-force) (30 G) resulted in poor coating of AP, but the flowability of this mixure after exposure to moisture was significantly enhanced, most probably as a result of graphene acting as an effective lubricant. Higher mixing energy (90-100 G) was required to break up agglomerates of graphene nanoplatelets and resulted in AP particles efficiently coated with graphene (APGR). Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the energy released upon decomposition of APGR was greater than pure AP, or AP mixed with graphene, due to the intimacy of the AP particle surface and the graphene coating.",2017
Safer energetic materials by a nanotechnological approach,"Energetic materials - explosives, thermites, populsive powders - are used in a variety of military and civilian applications. Their mechanical and electrostatic sensitivity is high in many cases, which can lead to accidents during handling and transport. These considerations limit the practical use of some energetic materials despite their good performance. For industrial applications, safety is one of the main criteria for selecting energetic materials. The sensitivity has been regarded as an intrinsic property of a substance for a long time. However, in recent years, several approaches to lower the sensitivity of a given substance, using nanotechnology and materials engineering, have been described. This feature article gives an overview over ways to prepare energetic (nano-) materials with a lower sensitivity.",2011
Detonation shock dynamics of composite energetic materials,"A reaction-rate equation for a composite energetic material was calibrated from two-dimensional steady-state experiment data by using the detonation shock dynamics theory. From experimental detonation velocities and shock-front shapes at different diameters for an ammonium nitrate-based emulsion explosive at 1.248 g/cm$\sp3,$ the relationship between the detonation velocity normal to the shock-front and the shock-front curvature was obtained. By using this relationship and solving the quasi one-dimensional Euler equations of motion in a problem-conforming intrinsic-coordinate frame obtained from the detonation shock dynamics theory, the reaction rate was determined as a function of pressure and density:$${d\lambda\over dt} = 20.0 \times 10\sp6\ {m exp}({-}14390/\sqrt{P/ho\sp{0.8418}})(1 - \lambda)\sp{1.889}$$where $\lambda$ is the reaction extent, t is the time in s, P is the pressure in Pa, and $ho$ is the density in kg/m$\sp3$. The reaction-rate equation obtained for this emulsion explosive shows that the rate is very slow and weakly state dependent. These characteristics of the rate indicated that the nonideal behavior of most industrial-type explosives can be attributed to their slow and state-insensitive rates. By using the above rate equation, one-dimensional initiation experiments (wedge tests) were numerically modeled with a one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrodynamic code. The calculated shock trajectories agreed very well with experimental wedge test data. This agreement also suggested that the small shock-curvature asymptotics may be valid even for a relatively large value of the curvature. The calibration method developed in this study is independent of the form of the rate. Realistic rate equations for explosives can be obtained in a very systematic way from two-dimensional steady-state experiments.",1990
Energetic intermetallic materials formed by cold spray,"Cold spray was used to synthesize three intermetallic energetic materials from powders composed of mixed Ni/Al, mixed Ni/Al/MoO3, and Ni-clad Al. After bulk samples were produced, characterization was performed to determine their composition and reactivity. Ignition was achieved with a 30 W CO2 laser and propagation rates were measured using a high speed digital video camera. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to obtain energetic properties of the composites at slow heating rates. The energetic properties of cold sprayed samples were compared with lower density axially pressed pellets of identical composition. Samples composed of a mechanical blend of Ni and Al powders had higher reaction propagation rates at lower densities; with the near fully-dense cold spray samples having the lowest propagation rates. The opposite was found in samples composed of Ni-clad Al powders, with propagation rate increasing with increasing density for pellets, and reaching a maximum in the cold sprayed samples. The samples containing MoO3 had mixed results, with pellets experiencing higher propagation rates for all MoO3 contents' with increasing density, but cold sprayed samples having lower propagation rates as the MoO3 content increased.

Modeling physical vapor deposition of energetic materials,"Morphology and microstructure of organic explosive films formed using physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes strongly depends on local surface temperature during deposition. Currently, there is no accurate means of quantifying the local surface temperature during PVD processes in the deposition chambers. This work focuses on using a multiphysics computational fluid dynamics tool, STARCCM+, to simulate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) deposition. The PETN vapor and solid phase were simulated using the volume of fluid method and its deposition in the vacuum chamber on spinning silicon wafers was modeled. The model also included the spinning copper cooling block where the wafers are placed along with the chiller operating with forced convection refrigerant. Implicit time-dependent simulations in two- and three-dimensional were performed to derive insights in the governing physics for PETN thin film formation. PETN is deposited at the rate of 14 nm/s at 142.9 degrees C on a wafer with an initial temperature of 22 degrees C. The deposition of PETN on the wafers was calculated at an assumed heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of 400W/m(2) K. This HTC proved to be the most sensitive parameter in determining the local surface temperature during deposition. Previous experimental work found noticeable microstructural changes with 0.5 mm fused silica wafers in place of silicon during the PETN deposition. This work showed that fused silica slows initial wafer cool down and results in similar to 10 degrees C difference for the surface temperature at 500 mu m PETN film thickness. It was also found that the deposition surface temperature is insensitive to the cooling power of the copper block due to the copper block's very large heat capacity and thermal conductivity relative to the heat input from the PVD process. Future work should incorporate the addition of local stress during PETN deposition. Based on simulation results, it is also recommended to investigate the impact of wafer surface energy on the PETN microstructure and morphology formation. Published by the AVS.",2018
Energetic nano-materials: Opportunities for enhanced performances,"This paper deals with the contribution of nano-materials to the contemporary pyrotechnics science. The breakthroughs in this domain are illustrated by several examples of energetic nano-materials recently studied in our laboratory. The solidification of energetic phases in a porous matrix (Cr2O3) Was used to prepare and to stabilize at nano-scale explosive particles. The thermo-chemical behaviour of RDX nano-particles strongly differs from the one of micron-sized RDX. For instance, the temperature at which the decomposition occurs is significantly lowered and the melting point is removed. The effect of the decomposition of RDX nanoparticles on the matrix in which they are trapped was observed for the first time by the atomic force microscopy. The Cr2O3/RDX nano-composite materials were mixed with aluminium nano-particles in order to formulate gas-generating nano-thermites (GGNT). The combustion of GGNT involves a synergy mechanism in which the decomposition of RDX nano-particles fragments the Cr2O3 matrix and primes the thermite reaction. ""Classical"" nano-thermites were obtained by mixing nano-particles (diameter < 100 nm) of metallic oxides (WO3) with a reducing metal (Al). These materials were used to demonstrate that nano-particles (i) significantly lower the ignition delay time and (ii) remarkably increase the combustion rate. Finally, pure RDX nano-particles are prepared by a continuous process of crystallization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010
Fluorine-Containing Functional Group-Based Energetic Materials,"Molecules featuring fluorine-containing functional groups exhibit outstanding properties with high density, low sensitivity, excellent thermal stability, and good energetic performance due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability and high density of fluorine. Hence, they play a pivotal role in the field of energetic materials. In light of current theoretical and experimental reports, this review systematically focuses on three types of energetic materials possessing fluorine-containing functional groups F- and NF2- substituted trinitromethyl groups (C(NO2)(2)F, C(NO2)(2)NF2), trifluoromethyl group (CF3), and difluoroamino and pentafluorosulfone groups (NF2, SF5) and investigates the synthetic methods, physicochemical parameters, and energetic properties of each. The incorporation of fluorine-containing functional moieties is critical for the development of novel high energy density materials, and is rapidly being adopted in the design of energetic materials.",2023
Energetic intermetallic materials formed by cold spray,"Cold spray is a recently developed particle consolidation technique that has attracted attention as a method to create structural energetic materials. These materials can be used to replace non-energetic structural components in munitions and other devices. This replacement effectively increases the energy density of the device, without the need to develop a new high explosive payload, which has historically been very challenging. These materials are also candidates for use in self-propagating high-temperature synthesis applications, where the product of the energetic reaction is a useful material itself. These reactants can be deposited in a shape near their final form using cold spray, and then ignited to form the desired product. The low gas temperatures used in cold spray differentiate it from other thermal spray techniques. These low temperatures allow particles to remain solid throughout the deposition process. This is a significant benefit, as materials that react when mixed in a molten state can be cold sprayed without reaction taking place. It is this feature that makes cold spray an attractive process for the creation of energetic materials. The energetic material used in this work is an intermetallic composed of a mixture of nickel (Ni) and aluminum (Al). The two metals are intimately mixed with each other as they are deposited, but remain heterogeneous until they are heated to the point of reaction. This intermetallic reaction is exothermic, gasless, and results in a product composed of various nickel aluminide phases, such as Al 3 Ni or AlNi. The goal of this work is to investigate methods to control the properties of energetic materials made using cold spray. To do this, three studies were undertaken. In the first, the effects of different feed powder microstructures on the energetic properties of cold sprayed material were explored. Cold sprayed materials were made and compared with pellets and loose powders with matching compositions. The cold sprayed samples were made using mixed Al and Ni powders as the feed material, or a powder composed of Al particles that had been coated with a Ni shell (Ni-clad Al). The materials were characterized by measuring the rate at which a reaction front propagated through the material, and the amount of heat released by the material, which was measured using differential scanning calorimetry. Results from this study showed that, in Ni-clad Al, the speed of the reaction front increased with material density and reached a maximum of 116 mm/s in the cold sprayed material. The material made with mixed Al and Ni powders showed the opposite trend, with cold sprayed material having the slowest propagation rate of only 6 mm/s. This difference in behavior was attributed to the flow of molten Al enhancing the reaction propagation rate in samples made of mixed Al and Ni, which was limited when those materials were consolidated to high densities. An analytical model was used to describe the reaction propagation rates for both the mixed and clad materials. In the second study, molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) was added to mixed-Al/Ni cold sprayed material to increase energy density and gas production through the exothermic Al/MoO 3 thermite reaction. Results from this study showed that added MoO 3 increased the reaction propagation rate over that of mixed Al and Ni with no added MoO 3 , but reduced heat evolved by the reaction in the calorimeter. In the final study, the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical and energetic properties of energetic cold sprayed material was explored. Cold sprayed materials, made with mixed Al and Ni powders and Ni-clad Al powder, were annealed at temperatures between 300 °C and 500 °C for four hours in argon. Changes in the structure of the material caused by annealing were studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, calorimetry was used to determine how the heat release of the materials was effected, and Vickers hardness testing was used to find how the mechanical properties of the materials were altered. Results showed that diffusion occurred in the samples during annealing, which led to the formation of intermediate product phases. These decreased the heat release of the materials from 926 J/g to 558 J/g for the Ni-clad Al material, and from 978 J/g to 159 J/g in the mixed-Al/Ni material. The results of these studies show that the cold spray process is an effective means of producing energetic materials, and that the properties of these materials can be controlled through the selection of feed powder microstructure, the addition of ternary components, and heat treatment.

Density functional theory studies of energetic materials,"First-principles calculations employing density functional theory (DFT) were performed on the energetic materials PETN, HMX, RDX, nitromethane, and a recently discovered material, nitrate ester 1 (NEST-1). The aims of the study were to accurately predict the isothermal equation of state for each material, improve the description of these molecular crystals in DFT by introducing a correction for dispersion interactions, and perform uniaxial compressions to investigate physical properties that might contribute to anisotropic sensitivity. For each system, hydrostatic-compression simulations were performed. Important properties calculated from the simulations such as the equilibrium structure, isothermal equation of state, and bulk moduli were compared with available experimental data to assess the agreement of the calculation method. The largest contribution to the error was believed to be caused by a poor description of van der Waals (vdW) interactions within the DFT formalism. An empirical van der Waals correction to DFT was added to VASP to increase agreement with experiment. The average agreement of the calculated unit-cell volumes for six energetic crystals improved from approximately 9% to 2%, and the isothermal EOS showed improvement for PETN, HMX, RDX, and nitromethane. A comparison was made between DFT results with and without the vdW correction to identify possible advantages and limitations. Uniaxial compressions perpendicular to seven low-index crystallographic planes were performed on PETN, HMX, RDX, nitromethane, and NEST-1. The principal stresses, shear stresses, and band gaps for each direction were compared with available experimental information on shock-induced sensitivity to determine possible correlations between physical properties and sensitivity. The results for PETN, the only system for which the anisotropic sensitivity has been thoroughly investigated by experiment, indicated a possible correlation between maximum shear stress and sensitivity. The uniaxial compressions that corresponded to the greatest maximum shear stresses in HMX, RDX, solid nitromethane, and NEST-1 were identified and predicted as directions with possibly greater sensitivity. Experimental data is anticipated for comparison with the predictions.",2009
Fused heterocycle-based energetic materials (2012-2019),"Fused cyclic energetic materials, a unique class of large conjugate structures which contain two or more rings that share two atoms and the bond between the rings, have been identified as promising contenders to traditional energetic materials. With a coplanar polycyclic structure, fused heterocyclic ring-based energetic materials feature considerably higher heats of formation (HOF) and ring-strain energy stored in the molecules. These result in attractive features of good energetic performance, enhanced thermal stability and low sensitivity toward destructive mechanical stimuli, which increases the safety of the synthesis, transfer, and storage of high-energy density compounds. This review addresses the chemistry of fused heterocyclic compounds, which provide valuable scaffolds for more powerful and less sensitive eco-friendly energetic materials. The reactions that are selected and discussed illustrate the versatility of 64 different fused heterocycles designed as building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of high-performance energetic materials.",2020
DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF PARTICULATE/POROUS ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"Dynamic behavior of particulate/porous energetic materials in a broad range of dynamic conditions (low velocity impact and explosively driven expansion of rings) is discussed. Samples of these materials were fabricated using Cold Isostatic Pressing and Hot Isostatic Pressing with and without vacuum encapsulation. The current interest in these materials is due to the combination of their high strength and output of energy under critical conditions of mechanical deformation. They may exhibit high compressive and tensile strength with the ability to undergo bulk distributed fracture resulting in small size reactive fragments. The mechanical properties of these materials and the fragment sizes produced by fracturing are highly sensitive to mesostructure. For example, the dynamic strength of Al-W composites with fine W particles is significantly larger than the strength of composites with coarse W particles at the same porosity. The morphology of W inclusions had a strong effect on the dynamic strength and fracture pattern. Experimental results are compared with numerical data.",2012
High-Rate Mechanical Properties of Energetic Materials,"Compared to the many thousands of studies that have been performed on the energy release mechanisms of high energy materials, relatively few studies have been performed (a few hundred) into their mechanical properties. Since it is increasingly desired to model the high rate deformation of such materials, it is of great importance to gather data on their response so that predictive constitutive models can be constructed. This paper reviews the state of the art concerning what is known about the mechanical response of high energy materials. Examples of such materials are polymer bonded explosives (used in munitions), propellants (used to propel rockets), and pyrotechnics (used to initiate munitions and also in flares).",2010
"Nitrodiaziridines: Unattainable yet, but Desired Energetic Materials","Using quantum chemical methods and the original technique based on atom-atom potential methods, the molecular and crystal structure simulation of all possible structural forms of nitrodiaziridines were carried out. The possible pathways of thermal decomposition of nitrodiaziridines were modeled, and the most stable forms were identified. Thermodynamic stability, physicochemical characteristics, and detonation properties were also estimated. The obtained results enable a huge potential of the nitrodiaziridine-based compounds as high-energy materials for a variety of applications.",2021
Engineering the Microstructure of Organic Energetic Materials,The initiation sensitivity is highly dependent on void structures within an energetic material. It is technically feasible to modify the initiation sensitivity by lithographically defining the size and distribution of included voids on the micro- and nanoscale. We proposed a method to pattern organic energetic materials using microcontact printing of self-assembled monolayers. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is spin-coated from solution as films onto patterned self-assembled monolayers. Images are presented for arbitrary patterns created based on the surface chemistry and concentration of the energetic material.,2009
"Modern trends in ""Green"" primary energetic materials","The evergrowing demand for cleaner, high-performing energetic materials (EMs) has led to a quest for replacement of currently used toxic metal-based traditional energetic compounds such as lead azide and lead styphnate. As such, significant effort has been placed on the implementation of nitrogen-rich frameworks as cleaner and safer alternatives to the environmentally harmful EMs. This review examines strategies for the design and synthesis of next-generation nitrogen-rich, ""green"" primary explosives. Three categories of this class of materials are examined, namely potassium-based energetic salts, metal-free ionic energetic salts and metal-free covalent energetic materials. Within each subsection, different combinations of nitrogen-rich frameworks and energetic substituents are highlighted in terms of their explosive performance, initiability, safety and environmental impact. As well, a brief summary and description of key parameters associated with energetic materials is also provided.",2021
Optical and transport properties of energetic materials,"The densities of Hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) based fast reacting liquids were measured as a function of pressure (up to 4.83 kbars) at several temperatures and the results of density measurements were fit to the Tait equation. Also the shear viscosities of this liquid were measured as a function of both pressure and temperature. The free volume model was applied to explain behavior of the shear viscosity with the assumption that only the reference temperature (T$\sb0$) in the Fulcher (1925), WLF (Williams, Landel, and Ferry) and Angell equations depends on pressure. The general relation to predict viscosity of this liquid at any temperature and pressure was derived and the difference between expected and measured values are about 5%. The phase diagrams of the HAN solution, Triethanol ammonium nitrate (TEAN) solution and LP-1845 were obtained through Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The TEAN solution has a eutectic temperature in the vicinity of 260$\sp\circ$K. The measured phase diagrams are in good agreement with the calculated phase diagrams. The TEAN solutions show a large supercooling effect. Some phase separation was observed in the TEAN solutions and this separation was believed to be due to eutectic composition of the TEAN solution. The expected freezing temperature of LP-1845 was almost the same with the calculated T$\sb0$ from the viscosity data. Raman spectra from the HAN solution, TEAN solution and LP-1845 were measured. Every peak in the spectra was assigned. These solutions show various interactions, such as ion-ion pairing and ion-water interaction. The strongest peak was a NO$\sb3\sp-$ symmetric stretch mode at 1050 cm$\sp{-1}$. The time correlation functions were calculated from the Raman spectra of the 1050 cm$\sp{-1}$ peak. The correlation time, which can be calculated from the linewidth, become shorter with decreasing temperatures and with increasing concentrations. The Kubo's stochastic theory explains the correlation functions very well if the solution is relatively dilute. The pressure dependence of the reaction rate was estimated by using the density data and Raman peak shift data.",1990
Pentaerythritol-Based Energetic Materials Related to PETN,"New tetravalent pentaerythritol tetranitrocarbamate (PETNC) and its tetraammonium salt have been synthesized by an efficient two-step synthesis starting from the cheap and commercially available pentaerythritol. In addition to full spectroscopic characterization, their thermal stabilities were examined by differential thermal analysis, and their energies of formation calculated. Furthermore, the structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.",2015
DISLOCATION MECHANICS ASPECTS OF ENERGETIC MATERIAL COMPOSITES,"The dislocation mechanics based properties of solid energetic materials, particularly, of high explosives, are of particular interest in connection with issues of intrinsic chemical stability and with their fast chemical decomposition when employed as propellants or in explosive formulations. The ballistic impact and shock-associated plasticity responses of such materials present great experimental and model challenges for establishment of predictable performances. As demonstrated in the present report, much has been learned through direct investigation with a full range of scientific tools of the individual crystal and composite material properties and, also, through their comparison with relevant inert ionic and metallic material behaviors. Thus, in relation to other solid material structures, energetic crystals are elastically compliant, plastically strong, and prone to cleavage fracture. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps for such materials, individual dislocation self-energies are indicated to be relatively large while the intrinsic crystal-determined dislocation mobility is restricted because of the complicated and rather dense molecular packing of awkwardly-shaped molecules that are self-organized within lower-symmetry crystal structures. Because crack surface energies are low, cleavage is able to be initiated by relatively small dislocation pile-ups and, with the restricted dislocation mobility, there is little additional plastic work requirement associated with cleavage crack propagation. Nevertheless, when compared with indentation fracture mechanics prediction, crack propagation appears to be controlled by the behavior of very limited dislocation activity at the crack tip. Adiabatic heating associated with dislocation pile-up avalanches provides an important mechanism for the thermal ""hot spot"" model of explaining the initiation of rapid chemical decompositions and relates directly to predicted influence of crystal (or particle) sizes. On such basis, desired characteristics of greater mechanical insensitivity to initiation but afterwards greater power dissipation are predicted to occur for energetic composite formulations made from smaller particle-sized ingredients.",2009
Site-Specific Photodecomposition in Conjugated Energetic Materials,"Nonadiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics (NEXMD) has been used to study photodecomposition in a class of recently synthesized bicyclic conjugated energetic materials (CEMs) composed of fused tetrazole and tetrazine derivatives with increasing oxygen substitutions. Modification by oxygen functionalization has already been demonstrated to increase the two-photon absorption intensity in the target CEMs while simultaneously improving oxygen balance. Photodecomposition mechanisms in materials that undergo nonlinear absorption could be used to achieve controlled, direct optical initiation. Here, we use NEXMD simulations to model the nonradiative relaxation and photodecomposition in CEMs following photoexcitation by a simulated Nd:YAG laser pulse. Excess electronic energy is quickly converted into vibrational energy on a sub-100 fs time scale resulting in bond dissociation. We find that, for the studied tetrazine derivatives, the bicyclic framework is an important structural feature that enhances the photochemical quantum yield and the high atomic oxygen content increases the relaxation lifetime and opens additional photodissociation pathways targeting the oxygen-substituted sites. The presented analysis scheme based on bond orders in the swarm of NEXMD trajectories is a useful tool for determining photochemical reactions.",2018
H Sensitive Polymeric Binders for Energetic Materials,"The aim of this research has been to develop a new generation of eco-friendly binders, soluble at alkaline pH, which could allow facile recovery of explosive fillers without using organic solvents, while maintaining their chemical and physical characteristics. For this purpose, ""smart"" polymeric binders are to be designed based on acrylic acid and other acrylic monomers. In this view, theoretical and experimental studies have been performed in order to establish which synthesized polymer is adequate for the desired application.",2017
Environmentally Friendly Energetic Materials for Initiation Devices,"The problems of synthesis, properties and applications of environmentally-friendly, primary explosives are discussed. Several prospective, lead-free primary explosives have been prepared and thoroughly studied during recent decades. However, the manufacture of modern, 'green' energetic materials on an industrial scale for practical applications in civil and military primers, is a task for the near future.",2012
Stability and degradation processes of energetic materials,"The use of binary inorganic solid-state fuel/oxidant redox processes typified by the classic aluminum/iron(III) oxide thermite reaction in combination with traditional energetic materials such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) has been of interest in order to produce higher output explosives. This dissertation focuses on the stability and degradation processes that occur with the combination of binary inorganic fuel/oxidant systems with high energy materials. First is a discussion on the stability of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as well as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) deposited onto the surface of metal oxides through a wet impregnation technique, which is followed by a discussion of the study of the initiation processes of the aluminum/iron(III) oxide thermite reaction using laser induced desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Finally, the photo-thermal initiation of an aluminum/iron(III) oxide thermite with PETN deposited on the surface of the iron(III) oxide in increasing increments was studied using a single pulse of a Nd:YAG laser at differing wavelengths in order to understand the effects of the presence of PETN on the time to initiation, as well as the deflagration duration of the thermite reaction.",2008
A continuum thermomechanical model for energetic materials,"Thermomechanical modeling of energetic materials, for example solid rocket motor propellants and explosives, is a complex problem due to the large number of behaviors such a material may exhibit. Experiments have shown that these materials are nonlinearly viscoelastic, and may also experience plastic flow (permanent deformation), phase changes (melting and vaporization processes), and combustion. In addition, these phenomena are often strongly coupled, making modeling very difficult. Compounding the difficulty further, reliable experimental data on the properties of these types of materials are quite scarce. Applying advanced tools of continuum thermomechanics, we have developed a fully three-dimensional framework which, in the most general form, is able to model all the mentioned behaviors of energetic materials. The concept of a balance of microforces, forces which drive changes in material microstructure, is employed to generate thermomechanically consistent equations of evolution for combustion and phase transitions. The model is then simplified to a set of three model problems: the constant-volume thermal explosion, one-dimensional shear loading, and one dimensional longitudinal loading. These model problems were solved numerically using essentially non-oscillatory and total variation diminishing methods. The solutions reveal extremely rich behavior, including complex wave phenomena, strain localization phenomena, and changes of material phase.",1998
Code Verification for Energetic Structural Material Simulations,"Current investigations of energetic structural materials involve shock-induced and shock-assisted chemical reactions in which complex physical processes are only elucidated by computational models of gas gun experiments at the present time. Physics models that describe the equation of state, material strength, heat transfer, and chemical reaction for energetic structural materials must he calibrated with experimental data to obtain material constants. Numerical solutions introduce errors that are difficult to quantity. This paper introduces a verification procedure of a code appropriate for simulation of gas gun experiments with energetic structural materials. Simulated gas gun experiments involving the Ni + Al mixture are used to illustrate the proposed verification procedure. The physics models together with the conservations of mass, momentum, and energy are explicitly solved using a second order finite volume scheme.",2009
First-Principles Atomistic Simulations of Energetic Materials,"This dissertation is concerned with the understanding of physico-chemical properties of energetic materials (EMs). Recently, a substantial amount of work has been directed towards calculations of equations of state and structural changes upon compression of existing EMs, as well as elucidating the underlying chemistry of initiation in detonating EMs. This work contributes to this effort by 1) predicting equations of state and thermo-physical properties of EMs, 2) predicting new phases of novel EMs, and 3) examining the initial stages of chemistry that result in detonation in EMs. The motivation for the first thrust, is to provide thermodynamic properties as input parameters for mesoscale modeling. Such properties are urgently sought for a wide range of temperatures and pressures, and are often difficult or even impossible to obtain from experiment. However, thermo-physical properties are obtained by calculating structural properties and vibration spectra using density function theory and employing the quasi-harmonic approximation. The second thrust is directed towards the prediction and investigation of novel polymorphs of known azide compounds to identify precursor materials for synthesis of polymeric nitrogen EMs. Structural searches are used to identify new polymorphs, while theoretical Raman spectra for these polymorphs are calculated to aid experimentalists in identifying the appearance of these azide compounds under high pressure. The final thrust is concerned with elucidating the initial chemical events that lead to detonation through hypervelocity collision simulations using first-principles molecular dynamics. The chemical mechanisms of initiation are determined from the atomic trajectory data, while heats of reaction are calculated to quantify energy trends of chemical transformations.",2014
Electricity-heat response curves of energetic materials,"Transient pulse testing (TPT) is a kind of non-destructive testing technique that can be used to obtain the electro-thermal response of initiators by applying a considerable low current to them. During the testing progress, it is important to ensure that the mining detonators do not function. Thus, it is desirable to know the current-induced temperature increment of the bridgewire. In order to obtain the temperature increment of the bridgewire in the TPT, the simulation of this test is described in this paper. Based on the heat transfer theory, a three-dimensional model is built on the assumption that there is no chemical reaction. Considering the initial conditions and the boundary conditions, the influence of different heat loss factors, heat capacities of bridgewire and currents to the result is studied through the usage of software FlexPDE. Theoretical results are represented in figures. Those results show that this new model is better than model Rosenthal when considering the temperature distribution along the bridgewire.",2007
Prediction of the Brisance of Energetic Materials,"The brisance parameter can be used to show the shattering power of an energetic compound and the speed to reach its peak pressure. It determines the effectiveness with which an explosive can fragment a shell. Nowadays, the sand test or sand crushing test is the preferred method for brisance measurements but there is no reliable method for the prediction of the brisance parameter. In this paper, a method for the prediction of the brisance through sand test for pure and mixed energetic materials as well as aluminized explosives is reported. It is based on the molecular structure of the desired compound and once the conclusion is established any experimental data is redundant. The calculated brisance relative to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (=100) shows good agreement with the measured values.",2014
John N. Sherwood: Studies of Energetic Materials,"A review of the contribution of ProfessorJohn Sherwoodand his group to the understanding of Energetic Materials is given.The work focused on four commonly used compounds, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The resultsof studies ranging from growth of highly perfect single crystals throughto powder diffraction allowed a greater understanding of the phasestabilities and mechanical properties of these intriguing materials. Studies on the physicomechanical properties of commonlyused energeticmaterials (EMs) that were pursued by the group led by Professor JohnSherwood are reviewed in this paper. The studies ranged from the growthof high quality single crystals and the characterization of theirdefect and dislocation structures, mechanical testing, through tothe study of polymorphism of EM crystals and fundamental aspects ofcrystallization processes in general. The work performed led to thedefinition of good growth conditions for all the EMs studied and tothe full characterization of the defect structure, slip systems, andhardness properties of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN). Partial characterization of the defect structuresand hardness properties of cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX)and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was also achieved. Additionally, fundamentalcrystal growth and polymorph information were defined, allowing adeeper understanding of the crystallization and crystal structureof TNT. In addition to the general review, some thoughts were givenas to possible future routes for further study that could suitablyutilize the complementary nature of established and modern techniques.",2023
Prediction of physicochemical properties of energetic materials,"An assessment of environmental impacts of new munitions is an important step for maintaining mission readiness in the Army industrial base. During production, waste streams generated may contain small amounts of the energetic material. Knowing how this material may partition in the environment is beneficial to development of waste treatment technologies. Physicochemical parameters define how this partitioning will occur. While these parameters can be experimentally determined once suitable amounts of the energetic material are available for testing, the ability to predict these important properties using the structure of the energetic material will provide a means for assessing their environmental impact during the preliminary development stage. In this work, the chemical structures of six energetic materials are used to estimate their physicochemical parameters. These energetic materials have been identified by researchers at CERL as materials under consideration as energetics in short-term development or longer-term development, and include dinitroanisole (DNAN), n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA), nitro-triazolene (NTO), triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), dinitro pyrazole (DNP) and m-trinitro imidazole (MTNI).

Energetic Windmill: Computational insight into guanidine-based nitroazole-substituted compounds as energetic materials,"In this work, we designed a series of energetic materials with a windmill-like structure based on guanidine and nitroazole, and optimized them at the B3LYP/6-311G** level using density functional theory (DFT). Based on the optimization results, we predicted the properties of all molecules, such as density, enthalpy of formation, detonation velocity, detonation pressure, and impact sensitivity. The results show that this series of compounds is a promising new energetic material. We screened out 6 molecules with a planar structure from these 14 molecules and calculated their geometry, natural bond orbital (NBO) charge, frontier molecular orbital, and molecular surface electrostatic potential. In addition, we also summarized the relevant laws of the formation of planar structures of this series of compounds and the structural components with excellent detonation properties.",2021
Energetic materials for nanocrystalline stainless steel production,"Austenitic stainless steel is one of the most common classes of metallic alloys sintered by powder metallurgy processing routes. However, the uncontrolled grain growth induced by the temperature used in conventional sintering must be avoided. The increase in specific surface together with the decrease in particle/grain size accelerates the kinetics of grain growth. Dynamic densification is a physical process in which the energy is transmitted to the powder at high pressure during an extremely reduced time period, which leads to interparticle bonding without significant thermal effects. In this study nanocrystalline stainless steel powders were densified by explosives and compared with microcrystalline powder. Nanocrystalline stainless steel powders were produced by mechanical milling and sputtering. In both cases, the densification by explosive composition with a detonation velocity of 4 mm/mu s leads to the formation of nanocrystalline bulk stainless steel, with the same chemical and structural compositions as the starting powders.

High-pressure structural studies of energetic materials,"This article reviews how the advances in the techniques for the collection and analysis of high-pressure X-ray and neutron diffraction data, augmented by spectroscopic data, now permit the accurate determination of the full crystal structure of energetic materials under extreme conditions. Using these methods, the crystal structure of the high-pressure gamma-form of RDX (1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-striazine) has been determined - the first case of a high-pressure structure of an energetic material. In addition, the crystal structure of the highly metastable beta-form has been determined and, contrary to the previous reports, has been shown to be different from the form obtained at elevated temperatures and pressures.",2010
"Synthesis, thermal behaviors, and energetic properties of asymmetrically substituted tetrazine-based energetic materials","1,2,4,5-tetrazine ring is a common structure for the construction of energy-containing compounds, and its high nitrogen content and large conjugation effect give it the advantage of a good balance between energy and mechanical stability as a high-nitrogen energy-containing material. However, most of the reported works about tetrazine energetic materials (EMs) are symmetrically substituted tetrazines due to their easy accessibility. A small number of reports show that asymmetrically substituted tetrazines also have good properties, such as high density and generation of enthalpy and energy. Herein, two asymmetrically substituted tetrazines and their five energetic salts were prepared and fully characterized by IR spectroscopy, NMR spectra, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The structure of the two compounds was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The thermal behaviors and thermodynamic parameters were determined and calculated. In addition, the energetic properties and impact sensitivities of all the compounds were obtained to assess their application potential. The results show that compounds 2-4 and 7-9 show higher detonation velocities than TNT, and the hydrazinium salt 9 possesses the best detonation properties (D = 8,232 m s(-1) and p = 23.6 GPa). Except for 4 and 3, all the other compounds are insensitive, which may be applied as insensitive explosives. Noncovalent interaction analysis was further carried out, and the result shows that the strong and high proportion of hydrogen bonds may contribute to the low-impact sensitivity.",2022
TOWARDS COHERENT CONTROL OF ENERGETIC MATERIAL INITIATION,"We present direct optical initiation (DOI) of energetic materials using coherent control of localized energy deposition. DOI requires depositing energy into the material to produce a critical size hot spot, which allows propagation of the reaction and thereby initiation. The hot spot characteristics needed for growth to initiation can be studied using quantum controlled initiation (QCI). Achieving QCI in condensed phase energetic materials requires optimally shaped ultrafast laser pulses to coherently guide the energy flow along desired paths. As a test of our quantum control capabilities we have successfully demonstrated our ability to control the reaction pathway of the chemical system stilbene. An acousto-optical modulator based pulse shaper was used at 266 nm, in a shaped pump / supercontinuum probe technique, to enhance and suppress the relative yields of the cis- to trans-stilbene isomerization. The quantum control techniques tested in the stilbene experiments are currently being used to investigate QCI of the explosive hexanitroazobenzene (HNAB).",2009
"Synthesis, characterization and energetic performance of metal boride compounds for insensitive energetic materials","Six metal boride compounds (AlB 2 , MgB 2 , Al 0.5 Mg 0.5 B 2 , AlB 12 , AlMgB 14 and SiB 6 ) with particle sizes between 10–20 μm were synthesized for insensitive energetic fuel additives from stoichiometric physical mixtures of elemental powders by high temperature solid state reaction. B 4 C was also investigated as a lower cost source of boron in AlB 2 synthesis and showed promise as a boron substitute. Thermal analysis confirmed that the formation of boride compounds from physical mixtures decreased sensitivity to low temperature oxidation over the aluminum standard. Both Al+2B and AlB 2 were much less sensitive to moisture degradation than aluminum in high humidity (10–100% relative humidity) and high temperature (20–80°C) environments. AlB 2 was determined to be safe to store for extended periods of time in cool, dry environments. Impact, friction and shock sensitivity testing indicated that AlB 2 and MgB 2 were less sensitive than aluminum. The activation energies for the oxidation of Al, B, Al+2B and AlB 2 were determined through an isothermal, isoconversional method in N 2 -20%O 2 and O 2 at one atmosphere. An activation energy of 413 ± 20 kJ/mol was calculated for AlB 2 in O 2 . The incorporation of magnesium and/or aluminum with boron increased its oxidation rate and overall conversion through the formation of metal-borate crystals (2B 2 O 3 ·Al 2 O 3 and 3B 2 O 2 ·MgO) which removed liquid B2O3 from the surface of oxidizing particles. Aluminum also increased the oxidation efficiency of B 4 C by a similar mechanism. AlB 2 , MgB 2 and Al 0.5 Mg 0.5 B 2 oxidized to greater than 85% of their theoretical values while exhibiting decreased sensitivity to low temperature oxidation, making them top candidates for further energetic testing. Cylinder expansion testing of AlMgB 14 showed little reaction of the boride material within seven volume expansions, corresponding to poor energetic performance. Detonation calorimetry of AlB 2 and Al + 2B using proprietary energetic mixtures in an argon atmosphere showed that AlB 2 reacted almost completely while Al + 2B did not. Future work should focus on testing the diboride materials and synthesizing and testing similar materials made from B 4 C.",2012
"Synthesis, Characterization, and Properties of Heat-Resistant Energetic Materials Based on C-C Bridged Dinitropyrazole Energetic Materials","Polycyclic energetic materials make up a distinctive class of conjugated structures that consist of two or more rings. In this work, 1,3-bis(3,5-dinitro-H-1-pyrazol-4-yl)-4,6-dinitrobenzene (BDPD) was synthesized and investigated in detail as a polycyclic heat-resistant energetic molecule that can be deprotonated by bases to obtain its anionic (3-5) salts. All compounds were thoroughly characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The structural features of BDPD and its salts were investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and analyzed by different kinds of computing software, like Multiwfn, Gaussian 09W, and so on. In addition, their thermal decomposition temperatures were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry to be 319.8-329.0 degrees C, revealing that they possessed high thermal stabilities. The results of impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity analysis confirm that these energetic compounds were insensitive. The detonation properties of neutral compound BDPD and all its nonmetallic salts were calculated by the EXPLO5 v6.05.04 program. The results revealed that their detonation performances were higher than those of the widely used heat-resistant explosive 2,2 ',4,4 ',6,6 '-hexanitrostilbene (HNS). Combining the above results, it is reasonable to suggest that these compounds have the potential to be heat-resistant energetic materials.",2024
Modeling Deflagration in Energetic Materials using the Uintah Computational Framework,"Predictive computer simulations of highly resolved large-scale 3D deflagrations and detonations are dependent on a robust reaction model embedded in a computational framework capable of running on massively parallel computer architectures. We have been developing such a model in the Uintah Computational Framework, which has exhibited good strong and weak scaling characteristics up to 512K cores[16]. Our focus is on predicting a Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT) when a large number of energetic devices are present. An example of this is a semi-tractor-trailer loaded with thousands of mining boosters that rolled over, ignited and went through a DDT. Our current reaction model adapts components from a) Ward, Son and Brewster[22] which incorporates the effects of pressure and initial temperature on deflagration, b) Berghout et al.[9] to model burning in cracks of damaged explosives, and c) Souers[20] for describing fully developed detonation. The reaction model has been subjected to extensive validation against experimental tests. Current efforts are focused on the effects of varying the grid resolution on multiple aspects of deflagration and the transition to detonation.",2015
Thermomechanical and numerical modeling of energetic materials and multi-material impact,"The aim of this thesis is the construction of a general purpose simulation tool that can simulate the elements found in an explosive system that include energetic (explosive) and inert (metal) materials. The work presented is mainly two-fold: (1) a thermomechanical model for an energetic material is developed based on a continuum model that uses two independent state variables to represent the phase transformation and the extent of chemical reaction, and (2) a high-resolution model is developed that simulates multi-material, multi-dimensional impact events (in which the energetic material of the first part can be one element) involving detonation and explosion physics. In the numerical model, we attempt to achieve high accuracy with Eulerian finite-difference methods that use essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme and level sets for handling the discontinuities of the flow field, and the Runge-Kutta schemes for a high-order accurate temporal advancing. The present continuum mechanical model of energetic material is thermodynamically self-consistent and can describe a material that undergoes phase transitions from solid to liquid to gas with exothermic chemical reaction. In various limits, the material is a classical elastic solid, a Newtonian viscous liquid, and a compressible gas. When modeling systems with energetic material compound, one needs to consider regions where different materials are in physical contact with each other whether the neighboring material is another explosive or a non-reacting inert material. Also one must properly model the material interfaces. These interfaces are tracked by the level set function, introduced as a passive scalar that the continuous pressure and normal velocity conditions are implicitly enforced across these boundaries. Two neighboring materials of distinct equations of state can be brought to contact while their contact surface may evolve according to the local particle velocity. Because the framework in which the simulation tool is developed is quite general, we expect a wide application of our model to many challenging multi-material physics problems.",2001
"Carbonyl-bridged energetic materials: biomimetic synthesis, organic catalytic synthesis, and energetic performances","In order to obtain high-performance energetic materials, in this work, carbonyl groups (C=O) have been newly introduced as sole bridging groups in the field of energetic materials. To this end, two tailored green methods for the synthesis of carbonyl-bridged energetic compounds have been developed for the first time. One is a biomimetic synthesis, in which the conversion route of heme to biliverdin has been used to obtain metal-containing energetic compounds. The other one is an organocatalysis, in which guanidinium serves as an energetic catalyst to afford other energetic compounds. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations have shown that carbonyl-bridged energetic compounds exhibit excellent energetic properties, which is promising for the carbonyl group as a new important and effective linker in energetic materials.",2016
Energetic Salts with π-Stacking and Hydrogen-Bonding Interactions Lead the Way to Future Energetic Materials,"Among energetic materials, there are two significant challenges facing researchers: 1) to develop ionic CHNO explosives with higher densities than their parent nonionic molecules and (2) to achieve a fine balance between high detonation performance and low sensitivity. We report a surprising energetic salt, hydroxylammonium 3-dinitromethanide-1,2,4-triazolone, that exhibits exceptional properties, viz., higher density, superior detonation performance, and improved thermal, impact, and friction stabilities, then those of its precursor, 3-dinitromethyl-1,2,4-triazolone. The solid-state structure features of the new energetic salt were investigated with X-ray diffraction which showed pi-stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions that contribute to closer packing and higher density. According to the experimental results and theoretical analysis, the newly designed energetic salt also gives rise to a workable compromise in high detonation properties and desirable stabilities. These findings will enhance the future prospects for rational energetic materials design and commence a new chapter in this field.",2015
Energetic Cocrystallization as the Most Significant Crystal Engineering Way to Create New Energetic Materials,"Crystal engineering is a highly efficient way to create new materials with the desired properties. Energetic cocrystallization has been thriving for & SIM;10 years since the appearance of a series of TNT-based energetic cocrystals (ECCs). ECCs serve as one important aspect of the crystal engineering of energetic materials (EMs). This article presents a brief overview of ECCs regarding the component, intermolecular interaction, packing structure, main properties, and preparation, as well as a theoretical treatment and some issues raised for future development. In most cases, the properties of an ECC are each moderated between those of the pure components, setting a basis for tuning properties by existing molecules, instead of synthesizing new molecules; meanwhile, there are also some exceptions, such as a higher density, higher detonation properties, or lower impact sensitivity in comparison with both of the pure components. These exceptions with mutated properties will expand EMs. Generally, the ECCs currently are staying at the primary stage, with much effort being required to solve some urgent issues, such as property evaluation, large-scale fabrication, and future applications. Still, energetic cocrystallization is a promising alternative to create new EMs with existing molecules; after all, it is a huge challenge to synthesize a satisfactory new energetic molecule.",
New thermally stable energetic materials: synthesis and characterization of guanylhydrazone substituted furoxan energetic derivatives,"New guanylhydrazone substituted furoxan energetic derivatives were synthesized via the condensation reactions of 3-methyl-4-furoxancarbaldehyde with aminoguanidine derivatives. The resulting compounds 1-5 were well characterized using IR spectroscopy, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry analysis as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the structures of compounds 1, 2 and 5 were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Except for the compounds 1 and 2, all the remaining products exhibit good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures above 200 degrees C. The detonation pressure values calculated for these compounds range from 17.0 to 28.3 GPa, and the detonation velocities range from 6906 to 8210 m s(-1). These values suggest that the guanylhydrazone substituted furoxan energetic derivatives could be potential candidates for thermally stable energetic materials.",2015
Enforced Layer-by-Layer Stacking of Energetic Salts towards High-Performance Insensitive Energetic Materials,"Development of modern high-performance insensitive energetic materials is significant because of the increasing demands for both military and civilian applications. Here we propose a rapid and facile strategy called the ""layer hydrogen bonding pairing approach"" to organize energetic molecules via layer-by-layer stacking, which grants access to tunable energetic materials with targeted properties. Using this strategy, an unusual energetic salt, hydroxylammonium 4-amino-furazan-3-yl-tetrazol-1-olate, with good detonation performances and excellent sensitivities, was designed, synthesized, and fully characterized. In addition, the expected unique layer-by-layer structure with a high crystal packing coefficient was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Calculations indicate that the layer-stacking structure of this material can absorb the mechanical stimuli-induced kinetic energy by converting it to layer sliding, which results in low sensitivity.",2015
Computer simulations and analysis of structural and energetic features of some crystalline energetic materials,"A database of 43 literature X-ray crystal structure determinations for compounds with known, or possible, energetic properties has been collected along with some sublimation enthalpies. A statistical study of these crystal structures, when compared to a sample of general organic crystals, reveals a population of anomalously short intermolecular oxygen-oxygen separations with an average crystal packing coefficient of 0.77 that differs significantly from 0.70 found for the general population. For the calculation of lattice energies, three atom-atom potential energy schemes and the semiempirical SCDS-PIXEL scheme are compared. The nature of the packing forces in these energetic materials is further analyzed by a study of the dispersive versus Coulombic contributions to overall lattice energies and to molecule-molecule energies in pairs of near neighbors in the crystals, a partitioning made possible by the unique features of the SCDS-PIXEL scheme. It is shown that dispersion forces are stronger than Coulombic forces, contrary to common belief. The low abundance of hydrogen atoms in these molecules, the close oxygen-oxygen contacts, and the high packing coefficients explain the observation that, for these energetic materials, crystal densities are anomalously high compared to those of most organic materials. However, an understanding, not to mention prediction or control, of the deeper mechanisms for the explosive power of these crystalline materials, such as the role of lattice defects, remains beyond present capabilities.",2007
Spatially focused microwave ignition of metallized energetic materials,"This study investigates the ability to locally ignite metallized propellants via microwave absorption. Metallized energetic composite films incorporating high mass loadings of aluminum and titanium nanoparticle fuels within a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix were constructed by direct-write additive manufacturing (3D printing). Simulations of power absorption for both Ti and Al nanoparticles reveal that the passivating shell composition likely plays a significant role in the observed ignition phenomenon. Various architectures of interest were constructed for predictable microwave ignition and propellant propagation. It was found that, although aluminum nanoparticles and composites do not ignite via exposure to microwaves, titanium nanoparticles can be used as efficient reactive microwave susceptors enabling a localized ignition source. This approach enables various architectures of previously studied high energy Al/PVDF systems to be fabricated and outfitted with a microwave-sensitive titanium composite in strategic locations as a means of remote ignition for aluminum systems.",2020
Novel opportunities for nanoporous carbons as energetic materials,"A novel energetic material based on nanoporous carbons as main ingredient is herein reported for the first time. Prepared by filling the pores of nanoporous carbons with an oxidizer, its energetic character is demonstrated. The decomposition of the oxidizer confined in the nanopores of the carbon renders a material capable to sustain a detonation. The energetic character-temperature and reactivity- seems to be promoted by the nanoconfinement of the salts. The safety properties of such materials are in line with the requirements for application as high explosives or propellants. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2020
High-pressure and temperature investigations of energetic materials,"Static high-pressure measurements are extremely useful for obtaining thermodynamic and phase stability information from a wide variety of materials. However, studying energetic materials can be challenging when extracting information from static high-pressure measurements. Energetic materials are traditionally C, H, N, O compounds with low crystalline symmetry, producing weak signal in commonly performed x-ray diffraction measurements. The small sample volume available in a static high-pressure cell exacerbates this issue. Additionally, typical hydrostatic compression media, such as methanol/ethanol, may react with many energetic materials. However, characterization of their thermodynamic parameters and phase stability is critical to understanding explosive performance and sensitivity. Crystalline properties, such as bulk modulus and thermal expansion, are necessary to accurately predict the behaviour of shocked solids using hydrodynamic codes. In order to obtain these values, equations of state of various energetic materials were investigated using synchrotron angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction experiments at static high-pressure and temperature. Intense synchrotron radiation overcomes the weak x-ray scattering of energetic materials in a pressure cell. The samples were hydrostatically compressed using a non-reactive hydrostatic medium and heated using a heated diamond anvil cell. Pressure - volume data for the materials were fit to the Birch-Murnaghan and Vinet formalisms to obtain bulk modulus and its first pressure derivative. Temperature - volume data at ambient pressure were fit to obtain the volume thermal expansion coefficient. Data from several energetic materials will be presented and compared.",2014
Trigger bond analysis of azo-based energetic materials,"Azo-based energetic materials may initiate explosive decomposition by extruding molecular nitrogen to produce radical fragments. Density functional theory and Wiberg bond index analysis were used to determine trends in bond strength for a series of aromatic azo compounds. Interactions between ortho ring hydrogens and an azo nitrogen lone pair favor a planar molecule with a strengthened azo linkage. Steric groups substituted ortho to the azo linkage cause the molecule to twist, which disrupts delocalization of the pi density and weakens the C-N-azo bond. The results of this study are generally consistent with the low sensitivity of various aromatic azo-based energetic materials. Discrepancies between calculated bond strengths and the experimental impact sensitivities could be attributed to packing forces that affect molecular planarity in the solid state.",2022
Modern Approaches to the Development of Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials (EMs) are compounds and compositions that respond rapidly to stimuli by releasing large amounts of gases and energy. These materials are typically central to a variety of commercial and military applications. However, some traditional and widely used energetic materials have toxic decomposition products and can be dangerous to handle due to impact sensitivity issues. One of the major goals for the energetics field is to develop more eco-friendly (non-polluting or readily degradable in the environment) materials that exhibit performance comparable to widely used energetic materials. An emerging class of energetics based on high-nitrogen materials promise to avoid the issues of traditional EMs. Some of the key properties of energetic materials include: oxygen balance, decomposition temperature, detonation velocity and detonation pressure. The stringent requirements for cost, manufacturability and performance are constraints such that new chemical entities are rarely introduced to the market. Here, crystal engineering strategies are employed to design new materials with desired physical and chemical properties. Crystal engineering is unique in being able to leverage existing manufacturing infrastructure for energetic materials. However, one must first uncover the fundamental rules of how energetic molecules interact to develop a design strategy. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on the advancement of modern strategies used to develop new energetic materials through supramolecular synthesis. Through the design of new energetic compounds and compositions, this investigation aims to improve undesired properties of existing energetic materials like toxic decomposition products and oxygen deficiency. Chapter 2 covers work that examines methods of cocrystal engineering with a high-nitrogen energetic material known as BTATz. Cocrystals are not known for many energetic materials and within the class of high-nitrogen molecules the quantity is even more limited. This is because the types of coformers suitable for co-crystallization with high-nitrogen energetics have not yet been elucidated. In this chapter, it is shown that high-nitrogen energetics can in fact form cocrystals and classes of molecules capable of interrupting strong intermolecular interactions are identified. In addition, theoretical energetic performance calculations are discussed. Synthesis of energetic coordination polymers represents a straightforward development approach wherein energetic ligands are coordinated to non-toxic metal ions to produce new metal-organic species. In Chapter 3, an effort towards generating multi-dimensional energetic coordination polymers with the high-nitrogen ligand, BTATz, is detailed. This approach is discussed as an effective means to synthesize energetic coordination polymers that directly incorporate high-nitrogen energetic materials as ligands. The pores of non-energetic metal-organic frameworks can be accessed for the adsorption of over oxidized guests to yield energetic compositions with adjustable oxygen content and modulated properties. In Chapter 4, the development MOF-oxidant composites utilizing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as porous hosts are presented. ZIFs are robust and thermally stable structures and two frameworks, ZIF-8 and ZIF-70 were used to absorb volatile tetranitromethane guests. The resultant ZIF-TNM composites exhibit high-energy release and more neutral oxygen balances relative to the porous frameworks. Finally, Chapter 5 will offer a summary on future directions that could be pursued in the development of new high-nitrogen energetic materials.",2019
Investigating aging effects for porous silicon energetic materials,"When infused with an oxidizer, on-chip porous silicon (PS) shows tremendous potential as an energetic material. However, applications such as fuzing and propulsion require long-term material stability. The present work utilizes accelerated lifetime testing for PS samples with sodium perchlorate (NaCIO4) oxidizer. Devices were exposed to elevated temperatures for various time intervals, then subjected to an electrical pulse through an integrated bridgewire to test for ignition. The pass/fail data from ignition testing was then analyzed to determine the mean and median failure point at each temperature using an Arrhenius aging model and a lognormal probability density function (PDF). Samples were heated over a temperature range of 185-300 degrees C for up to 46 h with median failure times ranging from 0.4-20 h. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate chemical changes of PS/NaCIO4 during aging. Comparison of DSC traces for aged samples showed differences for heating above and below 250 degrees C, suggesting two different aging mechanisms. FTIR results suggest that for low temperature aging (below similar to 250 degrees C) the hydrogen termination layer of the porous silicon was still intact, but backbond oxidation did occur. Above degrees 250 degrees C the hydrogen termination layer was no longer evident in FFIR and considerable oxidation occurred, suggesting reaction or dissociation of the hydrogen layer. This corresponds with an exothermic peak shown during DSC at 300 degrees C. Thermogravimetric analysis/mass spectroscopy (TGAIMS) was also performed, and confirmed hydrogen gas release beginning at similar to 280 degrees C. A DSC peak at similar to 400 degrees C is evident for fresh samples, but is greatly reduced or not evident for all aged samples. We attribute this peak to backbond oxidation, which is shown to occur in FFIR for all aged samples. Variable heating rate DSC experiments were also performed to determine activation energy of fresh and aged samples. Activation energy was calculated using the Kissinger Method for the first two exothermic peaks in DSC experiments. For the first peak, corresponding to hydrogen desorption (similar to 300 degrees C), activation energy for fresh and aged samples was 132.1 kJ/mol and 132.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The activation energy of the second exothermic peak, corresponding to backbond oxidation, for fresh and aged samples was 183.8 kJ/mol and 159.6 kJ/mol, respectively. Device failure during accelerated aging tests was also used to predict the mean lifetime of porous silicon/sodium perchlorate at room temperature (25 degrees C) as 100 years with a 90% confidence interval of 31 to 328 years.

CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICLES OF MILLED ENERGETIC PLANT MATERIAL,"The aim of this work. was to determine and compare particle sizes and their critical speed of milled material of seven energetic plants species. The testing material used was plants of willow, giant miscanthus, spartina, polygonaceous, rose, Virginia mallow and topinambour. The polygonaceous mixture material was characterized by the highest critical speed of particles and Virginia mallow and spartina the lowest; these formed a homogeneous group of speed. The values of particles critical speed of milled material of topinambour, giant miscanthus, rose and willow formed another intermediate homogeneous group. For the homogeneous groups regression equations between the critical speed and geometric mean particles size were presented that can be used to predict the speed of the particles size at the investigated range. The arithmetic mean value was greater than the geometric critical speed of particles and the dependence of this equation was described by a straight line. Differences in characteristics of critical speed among energetic plants species are due to differences in their physical properties, because each plant has a different build of shoot or tissue, stem stiffness, hardness and material moisture content.",2010
Thermal interaction of inert additives in energetic materials,"The inclusion of insulating inert particles in energetic materials has shown burning rate enhancement in certain cases, contradictory to the traditional laminar flame theory. Flame front corrugation that increases the reaction front area observed at micron to sub-millimeter scales was proposed previously to explain the phenomenon. However, a recent simulation study observed a significant temperature gradient within the inert particle, implying that the residence time of the inert particle in the flame front could play a role in the thermal interaction between additives and surrounding energetic materials. In this work, we tested these hypotheses by employing a high-speed microscopic imaging system to quantify the burning rate and flame morphology of Al/CuO nanothermites with various SiO2 2 particle sizes and mass loading. Additionally, we performed flame propagation simulations to quantify the thermal interactions between the energetic materials and the embedded single inert particle. The experimental results show that the burning rate depends on the particle size as well as mass loading. Specifically, as the SiO2 2 particle size increases from 100 nm to 100 mu m, the burning rate is enhanced by 26% at a mass loading of 7.5%. Further computational studies reveal that flame corrugation may not be the sole factor to alter the burning rate. Non-dimensional analyses show that energy absorption and temperature non-uniformity in inert particles have strong correlations with particle diameter. When the characteristic time of heating the inert particle is shorter than the flame residence time, the inert particle acts as a heat sink, leading to a negative impact on burning rates due to the heat removal from the surrounding energetic materials. This reveals that both flame front morphology and heat transfer, altered by inert additives with different particle sizes, play a key role in burning rates.",2024
Facile Fabrication of Energetic Nanocomposite Materials by Polydopamine,"Polydopamine-based materials have been widely investigated for incorporation in energetic nanocomposites due to their outstanding adherence. However, these materials are often prepared in alkaline environments, which negatively affects Al nanoparticles. In this study, a one-pot assembly was devised for the preparation of a polydopamine-based Al/CuO energetic nanocomposite material (Al/PDA/CuO) in a neutral environment. The CuO and Al nanoparticles of the Al/PDA/CuO nanothermite were uniformly dispersed and closely combined. Consequently, the Al/PDA/CuO nanothermite was able to release more heat (2069.7 J/g) than physically mixed Al/CuO (1438.9 J/g). Furthermore, the universality of using polydopamine in the assembly of different types of energetic nanocomposite materials was verified, including an organic energetic material-nanothermit (HMX/PDA/Al/CuO nanothermite) and an inorganic oxidant-metal nanocatalyst (AP/PDA/Fe2O3). This study provides a promising route for the preparation of polydopamine-based energetic nanocomposites in neutral aqueous solutions.",2023
Materials Research with Energetic Heavy Ions at GSI,"Materials research at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. employs the energetic heavy-ion beams from the large accelerators operated by GSI, and encompasses a broad spectrum of basic and applied aspects. This article gives all overview of the main topics and illustrates them with some recent results. Phase transitions have been stimulated in graphite and zircon by simultaneous exposure to high pessure and heavy ions. The damage trails caused by energetic heavy ions along their trajectories in materials such as organic polymers and mica are transformed by chemical etching into channels with diameters down to the narometer scale. These pores call serve as model systems for biological ion channels and. furthermore, represent promising devices for biosensor applications. Metal and semimetal nanowires have been created by filling etched ion tracks in polymer foils, related studies focusing oil electrical, optical, and thermal properties of single nanowires. The heavy-ion microprobe is able to target a sample with a single ion including uranium. having specific kinetic energies lip to 12 MeV/amu, with a precision of about 1 mu m. Single-ion irradiation of individual cell nuclei in a cell culture is one of the objectives under investigation.",2009
Energetic material response to ultrafast indirect laser heating,"The initial evolution of thermal energy transfer into a solid explosive is studied using an indirect femtosecond laser heating technique on a picosecond timescale in order to elucidate the role of temperature in the shockinduced initiation of explosives. The indirect laser heating method is presented; time-resolved visible transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was used to monitor the energetic material response following heat transfer from the laser-heated gold (Au) layer to the sample. Reported here are visible TA data in the spectral region from 500 to 750 nm for indirect laser-heated thin films of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), oxidized polyethylene (OPE), and RDX with 1%, 2.5%, 5%, or 10% OPE prior to decomposition. TA was observed for RDX and RDX with OPE; however, no TA was observed for pure OPE. Compared to pure RDX, the TA intensity of RDX with OPE decreases as the OPE content increases and the time required to observe the TA signal from RDX increases. Our results suggest that the thermal energy produced by a femtosecond laser pulse with an energy of 15 mJ cm(-2) is sufficient to induce changes in the electronic structure of RDX, resulting in promotion of the RDX molecules into an excited state. We also determined that the heat transfer rate in RDX depends on its homogeneity and degree of purity.",2017
Energetic Material Detonation Characterization: A Laboratory-Scale Approach,"A novel energetic-material detonation and air-blast characterization technique is proposed through the use of a laboratory-scale-based modified aquarium test. A streak camera is used to record the radial shock wave expansion rate at the energetic materialair interface of spherical laboratory-scale (i.e., gram-range) charges detonated in air. A linear regression fit is applied to the measured streak record data. Using this in conjunction with the conservation laws, material Hugoniots, and two empirically established relationships, a procedure is developed to determine fundamental detonation properties (pressure, velocity, particle velocity, and density) and air shock wave properties (pressure, velocity, particle velocity, and density) at the energetic materialair interface. The experimentally determined properties are in good agreement with published values. The theory's applicability is extended using historical experimental test data due to the limited number of experiments able to be performed. Predicted detonation wave and air shock wave properties are in good agreement for a multitude of energetics across various atmospheric conditions.",2013
Promising Energetic Melt-Castable Material with Balanced Properties,"Asone of the most widely used energetic materials to date, trinitrotoluene(TNT) suffers from several generally known drawbacks such as hightoxicity, oil permeability, and poor mechanical properties, whichare driving researchers to explore new high-performance energeticmelt-castable materials for replacing TNT. However, it still remainsa great challenge to discover a promising TNT alternative due to themultidimensional requirements for practical applications. Herein,we reported a new promising energetic melt-castable molecule, 4-methoxy-1-methyl-3,5-dinitro-1H-pyrazole (named as DMDNP). Besides a reasonable meltingpoint (T (m): 94.8 degrees C), good thermostability(T (d): 293.2 degrees C), and excellent chemicalcompatibility, DMDNP exhibits some obvious advantages over TNT includingmore environmentally friendly synthesis, high yield, low toxicity,low volume shrinkage, low mechanical and electrostatic sensitivities,etc., demonstrating well-balanced properties and great promise asa TNT replacement.",2023
Energetic Materials Combustion Catalysis: Necessary Conditions for Implementation,"The features of the catalysis of combustion of aromatic nitro compounds (trinitrates of toluene, resorcinol, phenol, etc.) have been studied. It has been shown that catalysts have a significant effect on the combustion of aromatic nitro compounds, and, as in the case of double-base propellants, their efficiency increases with the addition of carbon materials, especially carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For example, the addition of 3% nickel salicylate in combination with 1% CNTs to trinitroresorcinol leads to an increase in its burning rate by 4.3 times. It has been shown that, as in the case of double-base propellants, a necessary condition for the catalysis of nitro compounds is the formation of a carbon frame (deposit char layer) on the burning surface, on which catalyst particles accumulate and accelerate exothermic reactions. This fact, combined with the high thermal conductivity of the carbon frame, leads to an increase in the heat flux into the condensed phase and an increase in the burning rate. As pressure increases, the formation of the frame becomes more difficult, and the effect of catalysts decreases, as a result of which the value of pressure exponent reduces. The proposed mechanism of combustion catalysis is applicable to almost any individual explosives and propellant compositions based on various plasticizers (nitroesters, linear liquid nitro compounds and nitramines, etc.), as well as containing powerful explosives (RDX, HMX, CL-20, etc.), the combustion of which proceeds due to the heat of redox reactions.",2021
Design of Energetic Materials Based on Asymmetric Oxadiazole,"A new family of asymmetric oxadiazole based energetic compounds were designed. Their electronic structures, heats of formation, detonation properties and stabilities were investigated by density functional theory. The results show that all the designed compounds have high positive heats of formation ranging from 115.4 to 2122.2 kJ mol(-1). -N- bridge/-N-3 groups played an important role in improving heats of formation while -O- bridge/-NF2 group made more contributions to the densities of the designed compounds. Detonation properties show that some compounds have equal or higher detonation velocities than RDX, while some other have higher detonation pressures than RDX. All the designed compounds have better impact sensitivities than those of RDX and HMX and meet the criterion of thermal stability. Finally, some of the compounds were screened as the candidates of high energy density compounds with superior detonation properties and stabilities to that of HMX and their electronic properties were investigated.",2019
Flame propagation in a composite solid energetic material,There is a growing interest in developing the micro and nanosized systems supporting the propagation of reaction waves for the needs of micropower generation and propulsion. Here we consider a thermal-diffusional model for composite energetic materials of the shell-core type which describes the propagation of combustion waves in such media of both nano and macroscopic sizes. It is demonstrated that by proper material design it is possible to substantially enhance the rate of combustion waves propagation and their stability. For macroscopic systems this opens possibilities for synthesis of new materials and creating new types of propulsion systems. For nanoscale systems we have found that the model substantially underpredicts the propagation velocities obtained in experiments thus implying that there are alternative ways for thermal energy transfer on such scales requiring further investigation.

Molecular dynamics nanoindentation simulation of an energetic material,"Molecular dynamics simulation approach is used to study nanoindentation of the (100) crystal surface of cyclotrimethylenetrintramine (RDX) by a diamond indenter. The indenter and substrate atoms interact via reactive force fields. Nanoindentation causes significant heating of the RDX substrate in the proximity of the indenter, resulting in the release of molecular fragments and subsequent ""walking"" motion of these molecules on the indenter surfaces.

Laser initiation of energetic materials: a historical overview,"Laser initiation of energetic materials has been a topic of interest almost since the invention of the first laser in 1960. Since then, a wide range of lasers, and an even wider range of energetic materials, ranging from sensitive primary explosives such as lead azide, to very insensitive explosives such as Triamino Trinitrobenzene (TATB) have been investigated. With the continuous reduction in laser size, and increase in laser energies and powers, using lasers to initiate energetic materials is becoming easier and more practical to implement in a system environment. In this paper we examine the development of the concept of laser initiation, from its early days using large Ruby lasers, to the more modem use of Nd:YAG lasers. We collate and present here the open source literature published in this field in order to produce a concise and accurate historical overview of the research published to date, and make a prediction of future trends where possible. We also examine research presented in enabling technologies, such as laser-driven flyer plates and high-energy optical fibers.",2007
Engineering Metal-Based Energetic Materials for Combustion Applications,"Metal-based energetic materials are attractive for combustion applications due to their high energy density, low cost, and low carbon emission. However, the slow and incomplete combustion of metal particles may prevent them from being widely used. The presence of a native oxide shell on the metal particle surface also slows down the oxygen diffusion, resulting in a high ignition threshold for boron (B) and micron-sized aluminum (Al) particles. Additionally, the incompatibility between metal particles and polymers leads to safety concerns and poor combustion performance of metal/polymer composites. To address the above problems, several strategies have been applied in this thesis, including interface engineering of the metal/polymer composites, addition of novel additives such as functionalized graphene, and morphology tuning, which is believed to enable more efficient applications of metal-based energetic materials in space exploration, hypersonic vehicles, thermites, and micro- and nano-devices. Specifically, the following works have been completed: First, interface engineering of B/HTPB composites. B particles are promising fuels for solid propulsion, which can be added into HTPB to form a solid fuel composite. However, the opposite polarities of the B surface and HTPB lead to B agglomerations and weak particle/matrix interfaces within the HTPB matrix. To address these problems, hydrophobic B particles are obtained via surface functionalization with nonpolar oleoyl chloride, which could improve the dispersion and interfacial interaction of B particles within HTPB. The dispersion and distribution of B particles within HTPB matrix are quantitatively imaged by X-ray CT, and the interfacial interaction is evaluated by DMA. As a result, surface-functionalized B/HTPB composites with particle loadings up to 40 wt% exhibit greatly enhanced Young's modulus, toughness, and heat of combustion. Second, functionalized graphene materials are used to lower the ignition threshold and facilitate the energy release of metal combustion. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) and graphene fluoride (GF), and/or their mixtures with Al and B particles are investigated by thermochemical analysis, reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulation, and optical ignition and combustion tests. The heat and reactive radicals generated from the disproportionation and dissociation reactions of GO and GF could facilitate the optical ignition of Al and B particles, leading to self-sustained combustion and long thermal and over-pressure events. The gaseous products of the aforementioned reactions reduce the agglomeration of condensed-phase products formed during metal combustion, resulting in higher combustion efficiency. Thermochemical analysis and RMD also suggests that GO and GF have thermal and chemical interactions at elevated temperature, which can further benefit the metal combustion. Third, morphology tuning of Al/CuO thermite composites. Compared to nano-sized particles, micron-sized Al is still desired for applications due to its higher effective Al content and fewer safety risks. However, the high ignition temperature and low reaction rate limit the use μ-Al in energetic applications such as thermite. Two facile synthesis methods are developed to modify the morphology of Al/CuO thermite. As a result, the precipitation method generates porous CuO networks attaching Al surface, which shows the shortest ignition delay time and highest energy release at optimal equivalence ratio.",2021
Preparation and Reactivity of Gasless Nanostructured Energetic Materials,"High-Energy Ball Milling (HEBM) is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high-energy collisions from the balls. Among other applications, it is a versatile technique that allows for effective preparation of gasless reactive nanostructured materials with high energy density per volume (Ni+Al, Ta+C, Ti+C). The structural transformations of reactive media, which take place during HEBM, define the reaction mechanism in the produced energetic composites. Varying the processing conditions permits fine tuning of the milling-induced microstructures of the fabricated composite particles. In turn, the reactivity, i.e., self-ignition temperature, ignition delay time, as well as reaction kinetics, of high energy density materials depends on its microstructure. Analysis of the milling-induced microstructures suggests that the formation of fresh oxygen-free intimate high surface area contacts between the reagents is responsible for the enhancement of their reactivity. This manifests itself in a reduction of ignition temperature and delay time, an increased rate of chemical reaction, and an overall decrease of the effective activation energy of the reaction. The protocol provides a detailed description for the preparation of reactive nanocomposites with tailored microstructure using short-term HEBM method. It also describes a high-speed thermal imaging technique to determine the ignition/combustion characteristics of the energetic materials. The protocol can be adapted to preparation and characterization of a variety of nanostructured energetic composites.",2015
Prognostics and Health Management for Energetic Material Systems,"In order to ensure that military and weapons systems are reliable and support civil development in finding alternative clean energy solution, research in energetic materials is being actively encouraged and expanded. However, reliability, safety, durability and stability are the main obstacles to the development of energetic materials. In order to solve these problems, health monitoring and lifetime assessment technology is currently being actively researched. This paper proposes prognostics and health management (PHM) as an effective tool to address these issues. A roadmap for developing PHM methodology for energetic material systems is proposed, and PHM benefits are also analyzed.",2010
Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy analysis of energetic materials.,"A number of energetic materials and explosives have been studied by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). They include black powder, neat explosives such as TNT, PETN, HMX, and RDX (in various forms), propellants such as M43 and JA2, and military explosives such as C4 and LX-14. Each of these materials gives a unique spectrum, and generally the spectra are reproducible shot to shot. We observed that the laser-produced microplasma did not initiate any of the energetic materials studied. Extensive studies of black powder and its ingredients by use of a reference spectral library have demonstrated excellent accuracy for unknown identification. Finally, we observed that these nitrogen- and oxygen-rich materials yield LIBS spectra in air that have correspondingly different O:N peak ratios compared with air. This difference can help in the detection and identification of such energetic materials.",t-20
Benzimidazole Derivatives as Energetic Materials: A Theoretical Study,"The explosive properties and stability of benzimidazole compounds are studied to determine the influence of substituents and their position. The results obtained reveal the conjugation of substituents as one of the crucial factors for the thermal stability of these compounds. We also found that two -CH3 substituents increase the thermal stability of the parent compound, while nitro groups decrease it. Moreover, the study clearly exhibits that the combination of an -NO2 substituent with -CH3 does not change the stability of the benzimidazole. On the other hand, nitro groups increase the chemical stability and explosive properties of the compounds under investigation, but their sensitivity could not fully satisfy the requirements of their safety and increase their toxicity. The main results of the study indicate that high thermal and chemical stability, low toxicity and sensitivity, and good explosive properties could be achieved by the precise combination of nitro, -CH3, and triazole ring substituents. These findings are very important for the design of new, effective, and non-sensitive explosives.",2021
Heterometallic Werner complexes as energetic materials,"New heterometallic Werner complexes have been synthesized by combining the cobalt cationic [Co(NH3)(6)](3+) species with a nitrato metal fragment [M(NO3)(4)](x-) (M = Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) or with metal oxides X2MO4 (M = Mo, W and X = Na, NH4). Depending on the metals, an organic and/or a water synthetic route was developed. X-Ray data on Mn and Cu precursors have shown the versatility of nitrate ligand coordination. TDA-TGA studies have been performed to demonstrate the energetic material character. The [Co(NH3)(6)](x)[M(NO3)(4)](3) complexes display a good oxygen balance and, as shown by standard sensitivity tests, are suitable for automotive applications.",2008
Time for pairing: cocrystals as advanced energetic materials,"Energetic materials that can store and rapidly release large amounts of chemical energy on demand play a vital role in both military and civilian fields. Modern energetic materials should have high density, high heat of formation and possess molecular stability that allow them to be manufactured, stored and handled safely. Recently, cocrystallization technology offers a promising platform for energetic materials to achieve a desired balance between high detonation performance and low sensitivity. This paper highlights recent developments of energetic cocrystals and details intermolecular interactions, physical parameters and detonation properties. The major part of the discussion relates to the different types of energetic cocrystals including cocrystals composed of energetic molecules and solvents, 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20)-based cocrystals and azole-based cocrystals, et al. In addition, resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) technique, bead milling and spray flash evaporation technique are also introduced as means for large-scale production of nanosized energetic cocrystals.",2016
The combustion performance of nanosilicon based energetic materials,"The reactive properties of energetic composite materials change dramatically within the nanoscale domain, below 100 nm. Nanoenergetic composites, or nanoenergetics, have high surface areas, small diffusion scales, and consequently dramatically faster reaction rates. This thesis reports work done to characterize the combustion performance of silicon-based nanoenergetic composites in order to give us a better understanding of their properties so that they can be tailored to specific applications. Specifically, the combustion properties of silicon nanopowder(nSi) energetic composites and nanoporous silicon (nPSi) energetic composites are studied. This thesis contains a thorough review the current state of silicon-based reactives, focusing on fabrication and combustion of nPSi-based energetic composites and also on the combustion of nSi-based energetic composite. The Combustion properties of nSi composites were studied by performing equilibrium calculations, “flame tests”, instrumented burn tube experiments and micro capillary tube burns. Equilibrium calculations show that the maximum predicted flame temperature for many Si/oxidizer systems is about 3000 K, with some exceptions. Specifically, the calculated flame temperatures for Si/metal oxides systems ranged from 2282 to 2978 K. Theoretical maximum gas production of the Si composites ranged from 350-6500 cm 3 /g, with Si/NH 4 ClO 4 producing the most gas and Si/Fe 2 O 3 producing the least. Composites consisting of nSi/NH 4 ClO 4 , nSi/KMnO 4 , and nSi/NaClO 4 x H 2 O were tested in instrumented burn tubes. The composite nSi/NH 4 ClO 4 showed the fastest burning rates which approached 530 m/s . Micro-capillary tubes were loaded with nSi/CuO and nSi/Bi 2 O 3 composites. Successful combustion propagation of these systems was achieved in capillary tubes with inner diameters of 150 and 250 μm . The combustion performance of oxidizer filled nanoporous silicon (nPSi) was also studied. nPSi samples with diameters of 2.54 cm were fabricated by electrochemical etching. The porosity of the samples ranged from 50% to 82%. The samples were cut into 3-5 mm strips and filled with an oxidizer. The nPSi samples were filled with the oxidizers NaClO 4 x 1H 2 O, Ca(ClO 4 ) 2 x 4H 2 O, sulfur and perfluoropolyether (PFPE). The loaded nPSi was then burned by igniting the sample with a hot Nichrome™ wire. The experiments were recorded using high speed photography from which burning rates were calculated. The burning rates did showed a strong dependency on quality of the oxidizer loading. The nPSi loaded with NaClO 4 x 1H 2 O produced burning rates that ranged from 115-550 cm/s . nPSi loaded with Ca(ClO 4 ) 2 x 4H 2 O had burning rates of 145-285 cm/s . A sulfur filled nPSi sample burned a rate of 16 to 290 cm/s , and perfluoropolyether loaded PSi burned at a rate of 1.4 cm/s .",2010
Prospective Symbiosis of Green Chemistry and Energetic Materials,"A global increase in environmental pollution demands the development of new cleaner chemical processes. Among urgent improvements, the replacement of traditional hydrocarbon-derived toxic organic solvents with neoteric solvents less harmful for the environment is one of the most vital issues. As a result of the favorable combination of their unique properties, ionic liquids (ILs), dense gases, and supercritical fluids (SCFs) have gained considerable attention as suitable green chemistry media for the preparation and modification of important chemical compounds and materials. In particular, they have a significant potential in a specific and very important area of research associated with the manufacture and processing of high-energy materials (HEMs). These large-scale manufacturing processes, in which hazardous chemicals and extreme conditions are used, produce a huge amount of hard-to-dispose-of waste. Furthermore, they are risky to staff, and any improvements that would reduce the fire and explosion risks of the corresponding processes are highly desirable. In this Review, useful applications of almost nonflammable ILs, dense gases, and SCFs (first of all, CO2) for nitration and other reactions used for manufacturing HEMs are considered. Recent advances in the field of energetic (oxygen-balanced and hypergolic) ILs are summarized. Significant attention is paid to the SCF-based micronization techniques, which improve the energetic performance of HEMs through an efficient control of the morphology and particle size distribution of the HEM fine particles, and to useful applications of SCFs in HEM processing that makes them less hazardous.",2017
Mechanochemically prepared reactive and energetic materials: a review,"Reactive and energetic materials are typically metastable and are expected to transform into thermodynamically favorable reaction products with substantial energy release. Preparation of such materials by mechanical milling is challenging: They are easily initiated by impact or friction. At the same time, milling offers a simple, scalable, and controllable technology capable of mixing reactive components on the nanoscale. In most cases, for reactive materials milling should be interrupted or arrested to preserve the metastable phases. Arrested reactive milling was exploited to prepare many inorganic reactive materials, including nanocomposite thermite, metal-metalloid, and intermetallic systems. Prepared materials are fully dense composites with unique properties, combining high density with extremely high reactivity. Different milling devices were used to prepare reactive materials and an approach was developed to transfer the process conditions between different mills. Different milling protocols, such as milling at cryogenic temperatures or staged milling can be used to prepare hybrid reactive materials with different components mixed on different scales; it was also used to tune the particle size distributions of metal-based reactive material powders. Metal-halogen composites were prepared, with metal matrix stabilizing a halogen (e.g., iodine) at temperatures substantially exceeding its boiling point. Mechanochemically prepared reactive materials can be classified based on the energy of reaction between components and the energy of oxidation of the bulk material composition. Work on mechanochemical preparation of reactive and energetic materials is reviewed with the focus on unique properties and ignition and combustion mechanisms of the mechanochemically prepared reactive materials. An ignition mechanism for nanothermites involving preignition reaction leading to a gas release preceding rapid temperature rise is discussed. A combustion mechanism is also discussed, in which the nanostructure of the mechanochemically prepared material is preserved despite the very high combustion temperatures.",2017
Computational Analysis of Ignition in Heterogeneous Energetic Materials,"This paper focuses on the ignition of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under conditions of non-shock loading. The analysis uses a recently developed ignition criterion [1] which is based on the quantification of the distributions of the sizes and temperatures of hotspots in loading events. This quantification is achieved by using a cohesive finite element method (CFEM) developed recently and the characterization by Tarver et al. [2] of the critical size-temperature threshold of hotspots required for chemical ignition of solid explosives. Calculations are performed on PBXs having monomodal grain size distributions with grain volume fractions varying between 0.72 and 0.90. The impact velocities considered vary between 100 and 200 ms(-1). Results show that the average distance between the hotspots is dependent on the grain volume fraction. As the grain volume fraction increases, the time to criticality (t(c)) decreases, signifying increases in the ignition sensitivity of PBX to impact loading. The microstructure-performance relations obtained can be used to design PBXs with tailored performance characteristics and safety envelopes.",2014
A New Energetic Material and its Risk Research,"Bis (1, 5-diamino-4-methyl-tetrazolium) azotetrazolate (BMDATZT) was synthesized with high yield in this work. The yield is 97.46%. The structure was characterized by IR, H-1 NMR, and MS. The single crystal of BMDATZT center dot 2H(2)O was first cultivated. The heat of formation, detonation pressure, and detonation velocity were first calculated. The crystalline density of BMDATZT center dot 2H(2)O is 1.573g/cm(3). BMDATZT has high detonation pressure and detonation velocity (P=25.06GPa, D=7.805kms(-1)), which are higher than those of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT). Its thermal and mechanical sensitivities are moderate. Therefore, it is a kind of insensitive nitrogen-rich energetic ionic salt with good performance, and it has potential application prospect in gas generating agent, explosive and solid propellant.",2016
Particle packings and microstructure modeling of energetic materials,"This dissertation explores the use of packings of frictionless hard particles as models of the microstructure of particulate heterogeneous materials. In the first part of this dissertation, we present the current mathematical framework used for understanding the properties of particle packings, as well as the methods and algorithms we have developed to generate packings of frictionless hard particles with a computer. We develop two algorithms to model hard-particle systems: a collision-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for the simulation of packings of spheres, and a novel hybrid algorithm employing both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques for the simulation of packings of particles with general convex shapes, such as spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids, polyhedra, etc. We focus heavily on performance in order to enable the simulation of large systems containing 10 6 –10 7 particles, previously too computationally expensive to simulate. We use performance benchmarks to demonstrate that our implementations of these algorithms scale roughly linearly with the number N of particles in the system, and show the impact that polydispersivity has on performance. In the second part of this dissertation we explore the properties of disordered and ordered hard-particle packings. We reproduce key results found in the literature for packings of spheres and polyhedra, and discuss some of their statistical properties. We then follow the discussion with applications of particle packings as models of the microstructure of particulate materials obtained via computed tomography. We find that the shape of the particles and their size distribution both play a crucial role in the determination of the statistical properties of heterogeneous materials.",2014
DEVELOPMENT OF REACTIVE FLOW MODELS FOR ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"In order to make the process of material model development more systematic for energetic materials, we have developed a procedure that makes use of nonlinear optimization to derive optimal values of parameters in the material models. A framework has been developed that makes use of the optimization software package DAKOTA driving the hydrocode CTH (both CTH and DAKOTA are developed and maintained at Sandia National Laboratories). CTH was used to model a set of characterization experiments that were used as the basis for the calibration of a particular model, for example, the cylinder test was used to calibrate the JWL equation of state, and the wedge test for the HVRB reactive burn model. As a verification test of the framework, we have determined material model constants for TNT and compared them to values published in the literature.",2010
Surface nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy of energetic materials: HMX,"The surfaces of solution-grown beta-HMX (beta-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) crystals were studied using vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG). In earlier work (Kim, H.; Lagutchev, A.; Dlott, D. D. Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 2005, 31, 116), such SFG spectra evidenced considerable variability as the similar to 200-mu m diameter laser beam was translated over crystal surfaces. We have now found this variability results from ubiquitous small deposits of delta-HMX on the surface of beta-HMX single crystals. SFG is a selective probe of molecules in noncentrosymmetric environments. Since beta-HMX is centrosymmetric, only the surface is SFG-active; however, delta-HMX is noncentrosymmetric, so a tiny delta-HMX deposit on a beta-HMX surface could dominate the SFG spectrum. We have found that rapid evaporation from tiny droplets of HMX solution produces only delta-HMX, presumably because the polar boat conformation of delta-HMX is stabilized in solution. We believe the delta-HMX deposits are created by the rapid drying of droplets of mother liquor clinging to solution-grown crystal surfaces. In this paper, we present SFG spectra of delta-HMX nanocrystals and beta-HMX surfaces in the CH-stretch and NO2-Stretch regions. Through an analysis of the beta-HMX/delta-HMX SFG intensity ratios and the surface variability, we deduce that the delta-HMX deposits we observe have dimensions of a few micrometers and a mean surface coverage that, depending on crystal growth conditions, ranges from 0.1 to I mu g/cm(2). The implications of these delta-HMX sites for energetic material performance are discussed briefly.",2007
Research on Electromagnetic Radiation Characteristics of Energetic Materials,"During the explosion of energetic materials, electromagnetic interference is generated, which can affect the normal operation of surrounding electronic equipment. Therefore, an electromagnetic radiation measurement device based on a short-wave omnidirectional antenna and ultra-wideband omnidirectional antenna was designed to measure the electromagnetic radiation generated by the explosion of energetic materials of different masses, and the electromagnetic radiation characteristics were obtained through data processing. The results showed that the electromagnetic signal can still be collected hundreds of milliseconds after the explosive is detonated, and the electromagnetic radiation generated by the explosion is continuous and intermittent, which is a phenomenon that has not been found in this field at present. The mass of the energetic material had a significant effect on the time-domain characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation generated by the explosion: the higher the mass of the energetic material was, the shorter the delay response of the electromagnetic signal was, the longer the duration was, and the earlier the peak appeared. The frequency of electromagnetic radiation signals generated by the explosion of energetic materials was mainly concentrated below 100 MHz, and the energy was most concentrated in the frequency band of 0 similar to 50 MHz. The composition of energetic materials had the greatest influence on the spectral distribution, and the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation produced by the explosion of explosives with different compositions had obvious specificity. The electromagnetic radiation intensity generated by the explosion of energetic materials had a strong correlation with the distance from the explosion center, and it significantly decreased as the distance increased. The structure and detonation method of energetic materials changed the geometrical motion pattern during the explosion, resulting in the non-uniformity of electromagnetic radiation propagation.",2022
Materials Physics for Thermoelectric and Related Energetic Applications,"Thermoelectrics study the direct inter-conversion between heat flow and electrical power, which has a wide range of applications including power generation and refrigeration. The performance of thermoelectricity generation and the refrigeration is characterized by a dimensionless number called the Figure-of-Merit ( ZT ), defined as ZT = σ S 2 T /κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, and T is the absolute temperature. Before 1993, the upper-limit of ZT was barely 1. After the efforts of more than twenty years, the upper-limit of ZT has been pushed up to ∼2. However, for the thermoelectric technology to be commercially attractive, the value of ZT and the cost of production have to be further improved. Most of the ZT enhancing strategies that have been proposed since 1993 involve the changing and the controlling of the dimension of materials systems, the scattering mechanism(s) of carriers, the shape of the electronic band structure and the density of states, and the magnitude of the band gap. As further research is carried out, it is found that these strategies do not always work to enhance ZT. Even for a working materials system, the improvement margin of increasing ZT can be small. The balancing between σ and S 2 /κ has significantly limited the improvement margin for our ZT enhancing goal. Therefore, we have two problems to explore: (1) how can we deal with the strong correlation between σ and S 2 /κ, when trying to enhance ZT , and (2) how can we make the above mentioned strategies more convergent as we change the dimension of materials systems, the scattering mechanism(s) of carriers, the shape of electronic band structure, and the magnitude of the band gap? This thesis aims to explore the solutions to these two major problems at the research frontier of thermoelectric ZT enhancement. The first problem is discussed by providing a new framework of pseudo- ZT s, where the electronic contribution ( zt e ) and the lattice contribution ( zt L ) to the overall ZT can be treated in a relatively separate manner. The second problem is discussed under this new framework of pseudo- ZT s, through four subsections: (i) scattering and system dimension; (ii) band structure; (iii) density of states; (iv) band gap. The one-to-one correspondence relation between the carrier scattering mechanism(s) and the maximum Seebeck coefficient is further studied. A new tool for scattering mechanism(s) inference and for the Seebeck coefficient enhancement is provided. For the band structure and the band gap part, advanced band engineering methods are provided to study nanostructured narrow-gap materials, the Dirac cone materials, and the anisotropic materials, which are historically found to be good thermoelectric materials. To further demonstrate the newly developed theories, this thesis has also illustrated the application of these models in some specific materials systems, including the graphene system, the transition metal dichalcogenides mono layer materials systems, the Bi 1-x Sb x alloys system, the In 1-x Ga x N alloys system, and the (Bi 1-y Sb y ) 2 (S 1-x Te x ) 3 alloys system.

Nano-aluminum as energetic material for rocket propellants,"A characterization of differently sized aluminum powders, by using BET (specific surface measurements), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), was performed in order to evaluate their performance in solid propellant. These aluminum powders were used in manufacturing composite rocket propellants, that are based on Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) as oxidizer and Hydroxyl-Terminated-PolyButadiene (HTPB) as binder. The reference formulation was AP/HTPB/Al with 68/17/15 mass fractions, respectively. The ballistic characterization of studied propellants, made in terms of steady burning rates, showed how better is the performance of nano-aluminized compared to micro-aluminized propellants. Measurements of Al powder ignition time and temperature were also carried out. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2007
Pre-ignition laser ablation of nanocomposite energetic materials,"Laser ignition of energetic material composites was studied for initiation with heating rates from 9.5 x 10(4) to 1.7 x 10 7 K/s. This is a unique heating rate regime for laser ignition studies because most studies employ either continuous wave CO2 lasers to provide thermal ignition or pulsed Nd:YAG lasers to provide shock ignition. In this study, aluminum (Al) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanoparticle powders were pressed into consolidated pellets and ignited using a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm wavelength) with varied pulse energy. Results show reduced ignition delay times corresponding to laser powers at the ablation threshold for the sample. Heating rate and absorption coefficient were determined from an axisymmetric heat transfer model. The model estimates absorption coefficients from 0.1 to 0.15 for consolidated pellets of Al+MoO3 at 1064 nm wavelength. Ablation resulted from fracturing caused by a rapid increase in thermal stress and slowed ignition of the pellet. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",2013
Computational Studies on Nitro-AzaboriridineA High-Energetic Material,"Nitrogen heterocycles and their derivatives are one of the classes of compounds that have been widely used in developing high-energetic materials. The energy content of the heterocycle ring systems can be increased by inclusion of nitro, cyano, and azido groups. In the present study nitro derivatives of small three-membered B-N-C ring compounds, viz. 1-nitro-1,2-azaboriridine, 1,3-dinitro-1,2-azaboriridine, and 1,3,3-trinitro-1,2-azaboriridine, have been considered. Thermodynamic properties and energetics of the above compounds have been taken for detailed computational study using G2, G3, and CBSQB3 compound methods. Studies reveal that these compounds can be considered for use as high-energetic materials. Detonation velocity (D) and detonation pressure (P) of the title compounds have also been evaluated using the Kamlet-Jacobs method based on the theoretical densities and heats of formation calculated at G3 level. Calculation shows that 1,3,3-trinitro-1,2-azaboriridine yields a detonation velocity of 9.14km/s and a detonation pressure of 40.2GPa at a loading density of 1.91g/cm3 that is comparable to powerful commercial explosives such as HMX (9.10km/s, 1.91g/cm3, 39.0GPa) and RDX (8.75km/s, 1.82g/cm3, 34.0GPa).",2010
Nanoparticles of energetic materials: synthesis and properties (review),"The replacement of micrometer-sized metal fuel powders in gas-generating solid propellants with nanosized metal powders has become a common trend in the design of new types of propellants in recent decades. This trend has been motivated by the unique properties of propellants containing nanocomponents. The emergence of nanostructured gas-generating propellants suggests new directions for the development of highly concentrated and efficient energy sources. Technologies for large-scale production of nanometal powders and other nanostructured materials with tailored characteristics have also experienced an impetuous development in recent years. This paper presents a classification, description, and competitive analysis of the main methods of producing nanoscale and nanostructured materials used to produce gas-generating propellants. The main advantages and difficulties concomitant with the use of nanomaterials in propellant formulations are discussed. Specific issues related to the high reactivity and pyrophoricity of nanomaterials and related risks are analyzed. Methods for the preservation and passivation of the surface of nanomaterials are classified and discussed. The focus is on those methods that are most widely used, and those that are considered promising today.",2013
Sensitivity and Performance of Azole-Based Energetic Materials,"Imidazole, pyrazole, 1,2,3-triazole-, 1,2,4-triazole-, and tetrazole-based energetic materials are theoretically investigated by employing density functional theory (DFT). Heats of formation (Delta H-f(0)'s) for the studied compounds (298 K) in the gas phase are determined at the B3P86/6-311G (d, p) theory level through isodesmic reactions. The bond dissociation energies (BDEs) corresponding to NO2, NH2, CH3, and Cl removal from carbon or nitrogen positions of the azole ring are also calculated at the B3P86/6-311G (d, p) theory level. The substituent effect of electron-withdrawing (NO2, Cl) and electron-donating (NH2, CH3) groups on the Delta(f)H(0)s and BDEs is discussed. Both electron-withdrawing groups and electron-donating groups (except the CH3 group) dramatically increase the Delta(f)H(0)s of these energetic materials when the substituent is at an N position on the azole ring. For substitution at a C atom on the azole ring, electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups have different effects on the Delta(f)H(0)s for different azole compounds. A correlation is developed for this series of energetics between impact sensitivity h(50%) and the defined sensitivity index (SI): based on this empirical relationship and its extrapolation, the impact sensitivities of compounds for which experiments are not available are provided. The promising energetic compounds in each groups, which have potentially good energetic performance and low sensitivity, are 1-amino-2,4,5-trinitroimidazole, 1-amino-3,4,5-trinitropyrazole, 1,4-dinitro-1,2,3-triazole, 1,3-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole, and 1-nitrotetrazole.",2013
Comparing the shock sensitivity of insensitive energetic materials,"We present a tabletop method to study the shock sensitivity of plastic-bonded explosives that are considered shock insensitive using high dynamic range optical emission spectroscopy with laser-launched km/s flyer plate impacts (2, 3, and 4 km/s), which measures the spectral radiance (the emission spectrum vs a calibrated intensity standard) every 0.8 ns in the nanosecond and microsecond regimes. The explosives were TATB (1,3,5 trinitro, 2,4,6 triamino benzene), FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene), LLM-105 (2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide), and NTO (nitrotriazolone), all with 20% Sylgard 182 binder. Time resolving emission from shocked explosives produces a unique fingerprint at each shock pressure, and the emission temporal profile can be used to understand each material's shock response and the underlying mechanisms within the framework of the well-known shock ignition and growth models. Ignition was characterized by the emission intensity during nanosecond hot spot ignition. The growth process, which occurs after the shock has unloaded, was characterized by the time derivative of microsecond emission intensity. Singular-value decomposition was used to determine a characteristic spectral radiance over the entire time range, and this radiance was fit to a graybody model to determine a characteristic temperature T-c. Even though these insensitive explosives have similar shock sensitivities, our method can clearly distinguish their shock response. FOX-7 and NTO were the most sensitive, with FOX-7 having the greatest shock ignition sensitivity, growth rate, and T-c. LLM-105 was much less sensitive than FOX-7 and NTO, and TATB consistently showed the lowest sensitivity by any measure.",2022
Remote detection of traces of high energetic materials,"The possibility of remote detection of traces of high energetic materials using laser fragmentation/laser-induced fluorescence (LF/LIF) method is studied. Experimental data on the remote visualization of traces of trinitrotoluene, hexogen, composition B, octogen, and tetryl obtained at a distance of 5 m with a scanning lidar detector of traces of high energetic materials are presented.",2015
Processing energetic materials with supercritical fluid precipitation techniques,"Research has shown that nano-sized particles of explosives have a reduced sensitivity to impact and shock. Nano-sized energetic particles have also shown promise in improving the performance of propellants and explosives. Therefore, a method to produce nano-sized explosive particles could be ideal for sensitivity and performance reasons. Supercritical fluid precipitation has been shown to produce nano-sized explosive particles effectively. This research explores the feasibility of processing energetic materials using three different supercritical fluid precipitation techniques. The first technique is called the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution (RESS). The RESS process dissolves a solute in a supercritical fluid and then rapidly expands the resulting solution through a nozzle to produce small (nano-sized) and uniform particles from a high degree of supersaturation. The second technique is the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution into a Liquid Solvent (RESOLV) Process. This process is similar to the RESS process except the supercritical solution is expanded into a liquid and dispersant solution to reduce particle agglomeration and to reduce the size of the particles further. The final technique investigated is the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution with a Nonsolute (RESS-N) process in which the precipitating solute is used to encapsulate or coat a nonsoluble substance by heterogeneous nucleation. This works takes both a theoretical an empirical approach. On the theoretical side, a numerical code that accounts for nucleation and condensation in the RESS process was written in FORTRAN to predict how altering pre-expansion pressures and pre-expansion temperatures in the RESS process could affect the final particle size of the produced RDX. It was determined that pre-expansion temperature had a marginal impact on final particle size but higher pre-expansion pressures were beneficial in forming smaller particles. Also, a software program called STABIL © was used to model nano-sized RDX particle interactions in a water and CO 2 suspension that would be created in the RESOLV process. STABIL © showed that polymer coatings are absolutely necessary as particles will agglomerate within minutes if the coatings are not present. In addition, the software program CEA was used to predict how polymer-coated RDX particles produced through the RESOLV process would perform in rocket and combustion applications. For the empirical part of this work, the RESS process was used to produce nano-sized particles of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and Bis(2,2,2-trinitroethyl)-3,6-diaminotetrazine (BTAT). Nano-sized particles of RDX were produced in the size range from 65±15 nm to 105±35 nm. Slightly smaller particles were observed for higher pre-expansion pressures. The RESS-produced RDX particles were also tested for their impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity. The RESS-produced RDX showed a dramatic decrease in impact sensitivity showing an increase in the 50% impact height from 17 cm to 44 cm. The friction and ESD sensitivity of the RESS-produced RDX was approximately the same as military grade RDX particles. BTAT particles were also produced using the RESS system. BTAT particles showed a dramatic decrease in particle size with a more optimal round morphology at higher pressures. The RESOLV process was used to produce well dispersed colloidal suspensions of PVP and PEI-coated RDX particles. The RESOLV-produced particles were as small as 30 nm and fairly stable against agglomeration for extended periods of time. Altered decomposition behavior was observed for RESOLV-produced RDX particles through analysis by differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis. Enough PVP-coated particles were produced with the RESOLV process to send them to the Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division (NAWC-WD) in China Lake, California. The PVP-coated particles showed no large differences in impact (19 cm 50% drop height instead of the standard 17 cm by ERL impact test) or ESD sensitivity (4 no-gos for NAWC ESD test) but showed a significant reduction towards initiation by friction (521 lbs threshold initiation level force instead of the standard 468 lbs by ABL friction test). The RESS-N process was used to coat nano-sized ALEX ® aluminum particles with RDX. Coatings were observed on the ALEX ® particles by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A method of injecting ALEX ® particles into the RDX/CO2 supercritical solution was developed that was effective in coating small batches with RDX.",2012
Flame structure and combustion chemistry of energetic materials,"A review of experimental studies of the structure of the flame of a number of energetic materials (EMs), such as ammonium perchlorate, ammonium dinitramide, RDX, HMX, and some model composite propellants on their bases, is presented.

Advanced susceptors for microwave heating of energetic materials,"Trinitrotoluene (TNT) like many monomolecular organic explosives is transparent to microwave energy. This study examines the influence of carbon additives to TNT purposefully selected to absorb microwave energy and enable heating throughout the composite. Five carbon additives with different shapes are analyzed including carbon nanotubes, spherical powder, diamond nanoparticles, graphene nano-flakes, and graphite micron-flakes. Eachwas added to TNT at a constant 1 wt.% concentration then subjected to 1.7 GHz ofmicrowave energy for up to one minute. In-situ two-dimensional transient temperature is measured using a high-resolution high-speed infrared (IR) camera. ANSYS high frequency structural simulator (HFSS) software simulated power absorption for each additive. Simulations predict tubes absorb more energy but experimentally flakes induce melting of the TNT faster. Further analysis of additive connectivity through the matrix suggests that inter-particle connectivity plays a strong role in enhancing heat transfer upon microwave attenuation; and flakes show the greatest inter-connectivity. Engineering composite materials with optimized additives could lead to advances in microwave technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Fragmentation of structural energetic materials: implications for performance,Fragmentation results for structural energetic materials based on intermetallic forming mixtures are reviewed and the implications of the fragment populations are discussed. Cold sprayed Ni+Al and explosively compacted mixtures of Ni+Al+W and Ni+Al+W+Zr powders were fabricated into ring shaped samples and explosively fragmented. Ring velocity was monitored and fragments were soft captured in order to study the fragmentation process. It was determined that the fragments produced by these structural energetic materials are much smaller than those typically produced by ductile metals such as steel or aluminum. This has implications for combustion processes that may occur subsequent to the fragmentation process.,2014
Energetic Materials based on 1-Amino-3-nitroguanidine,"1-Amino-3-nitroguanidine (2) was synthesized by hydrazinolysis of nitroguanidine (I). Due to its basicity, it can be protonated by energetic compounds bearing an acidic proton. The chloride (3) and perchlorate (5) salts of 1-amino-3-nitroguanidine were synthesized by protonation of 2 with dilute hydrochloric acid and perchloric acid, respectively. 5-Nitrimino-1,4H-tetrazole was used to synthesize the nitriminotetrazolate salt (9). 5-Nitrimino-1,4H-tetrazole was obtained by reacting 5-amino-1H-tetrazole with 100% HNO3. Furthermore, the dinitramide (6) salt of 1-amino-3-nitroguanidine was synthesized by metathesis reaction of silver dinitramide and 1-amino-3-nitroguanidiniunz chloride (3).The dinitroguanidinate salt (8) was synthesized by protonation of 2 with dinitroguanidine. Dinitroguanidine was prepared by nitroguanidine in anhydrous nitric acid /N2O5. All compounds were fully characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and DSC measurements. The heats of formation of 2, 6, 8 and 9 were calculated using the atomization method based on CBS-4M enthalpies. With these values and the experimental (X-ray) densities several detonation parameters such as the detonation pressure, velocity, energy and temperature were computed using the EXPLO5 code. In addition, the sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrical discharge were tested using the BAM drophammer, friction tester as well as a small scale electrical discharge device.",2010
Advanced energetic materials: novel strategies and versatile applications,"Novel efficient synthetic strategies, including green methodologies, to basic and perspective high-energy density compounds, bearing active oxygen sources (C-, N- and O-nitro groups and N-oxide fragments) and high-enthalpy polynitrogen heterocycles, are briefly overviewed. Recently developed synthetic approaches to nitro group-free hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) and strained 1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane derivatives capable of ultrafast ignition upon mixing with an oxidizer, and to high-energy liquid hydrocarbons with strained cyclopropane fragments are also considered. Physicochemical properties, energetic performances and potential applications of energetic compounds and composites as key components of explosives, powders and solid or liquid rocket propellants are critically discussed with a focus on original reports published in the period 2016-2021.",2021
Probabilistic study on thermal sensitivity of energetic material,"The Frank-Kamenetskii parameter delta was supposed as stochastic variable of normal distribution, by the application of the probability density formula of monotone function, the thermal sensitivity probability density function of energetic material was worked out. On this basic, the thermal safety degree of energetic material was calculated. The result show that: the thermal sensitivity of energetic material is not normal distribution, but it is a kind of new probability density function which is decided by geometric factors: the characteristic measurement of reactant: ""a"" and geometric shape of reactant and chemical factors: quantity of reaction heat: ""Q'; activation energy: ""E'; density: ""p""; frequency factor: ""A""; thermal conductivity: ""k"". The calculation show that: the value of safety degree is decided by the sensitivity distribution function.",2007
Mechanical stimulation of energetic materials at the nanoscale,"The initiation of energetic materials by mechanical stimuli is a critical stage of their functioning, but remains poorly understood. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) we explore the microscopic initiation behavior of four prototypical energetic materials: 3,4-dinitropyrazole, epsilon-CL-20, alpha-PETN and picric acid. Along with the various chemical structures, these energetic compounds cover a range of application types: a promising melt-cast explosive, the most powerful energetic compound in use, a widespread primary explosive, and a well-established nitroaromatic explosive from the early development of energetics. For the softest materials (picric acid and 3,4-dinitropyrazole), the surfaces were found to behave dynamically, quickly rearranging in response to mechanical deformation. The pit created by nanoscale friction stimulation on the surface of 3,4-dinitropyrazole doubled in volume upon aging for half an hour. Over the same time frame, a similar pit on the picric acid surface increased in volume by more than seven-fold. Remarkably, increased humidity was found to reduce the rate of surface rearrangement, potentially offering an origin for the desensitization of energetic materials when wetted. Finally, we identify an inverse correlation between the surface dynamics and mechanical sensitivity of our test energetic compounds. This strongly suggests that surface dynamics influence a material's ability to dissipate excess energy, acting as a buffer towards mechanical initiation.",2022
Mathematical Modelling and Analysis of Sheared Energetic Materials,"The large stores of chemical energy within energetic materials mean that their improper handling poses a serious safety concern, and so appropriate safety protocols need to be put in place. To do so requires understanding of the materials, but their mechanical properties cannot be easily determined through rheometric testing precisely because of the safety risks involved. To proceed, mathematical models can be created that simulate the mechanical behaviour. The core objective of the present work has been to develop reduced and thus mathematically tractable models that, by focusing on general physical principles, capture the essential aspects of the behaviour of sheared energetic materials. In particular, a dynamic model has been developed to examine the phenomenon of shear banding, motivated by its ability to cause extreme shear rates within shrinking regions and the resultant likelihood of hotspot generation. In the model, dynamic shear banding is treated by considering simple shear of a slab of shear-softening, bi-viscous fluid, producing a parabolic free-boundary problem for the diffusion of shear stress through the shear band and surrounding unyielded material. The behaviour of the system is analysed using precise asymptotic methods, and expansions involving material parameters are obtained for the growth of the shear band over time, and the spacetime variation of shear stress within the band and the surrounding region. In turn, the latter allows for determination of the spacetime variation of the rate of local heating due to mechanical dissipation within the band and the hard region, giving order-of-magnitude predictions for temperature increases likely to occur within the material. Since the expansions are in terms of material parameters, an opportunity for comparison against experiment arises. We expect good qualitative agreement of the model with empirical results after assignment of suitable parameter values for a given material sample.",2021
Shock induced chemical reactions in energetic structural materials,"Energetic structural materials (ESMs) constitute a new class of materials that provide dual functions of strength and energetic characteristics. ESMs are typically composed of micron-scale or nano-scale intermetallic mixtures or mixtures of metals and metal oxides, polymer binders, and structural reinforcements. Voids are included to produce a composite with favorable chemical reaction characteristics. In this thesis, a continuum approach is used to simulate gas-gun or explosive loading experiments where a strong shock is induced in the ESM by an impacting plate. Algorithms are developed to obtain equations of state of mixtures. It is usually assumed that the shock loading increases the energy of the ESM and causes the ESM to reach the transition state. It is also assumed that the activation energy needed to reach the transition state is a function of the temperature of the mixture. In this thesis, it is proposed that the activation energy is a function of temperature and the stress state of the mixture. The incorporation of such an activation energy is selected in this thesis. Then, a multi-scale chemical reaction model for a heterogeneous mixture is introduced. This model incorporates reaction initiation, propagation, and extent of completed reaction in spatially heterogeneous distributions of reactants. A new model is proposed for the pore collapse of mixtures. This model is formulated by modifying the Carol, Holt, and Nesterenko spherically symmetric model to include mixtures and compressibility effects. Uncertainties in the model result from assumptions in formulating the models for continuum relationships and chemical reactions in mixtures that are distributed heterogeneously in space and in numerical integration of the resulting equations. It is important to quantify these uncertainties. In this thesis, such an uncertainty quantification is investigated by systematically identifying the physical processes that occur during shock compression of ESMs which are then used to construct a hierarchical framework for uncertainty quantification.",2009
Non-equilibrium thermomechanics of multifunctional energetic structural materials,"Shock waves create a unique environment of high pressure, high temperature and high strain-rates. It has been observed that chemical reactions that occur in this regime are exothermic and can lead to the synthesis of new materials that are not possible under other conditions. The exothermic reaction is used in the development of binary energetic materials. These materials are of significant interest to the energetic materials community because of its capability of releasing high heat content during a chemical reaction and the relative insensitivity of these types of energetic materials. Synthesis of these energetic materials, at nano grain sizes with structural reinforcements, provides an opportunity to develop a dual functional material with both strength and energetic characteristics. Shock-induced chemical reactions pose challenges in experiment and instrumentation. This thesis is addressed to the theoretical development of constitutive models of shock-induced chemical reactions in energetic composites, formulated in the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and mixture theories, in a continuum scale. Transition state-based chemical reaction models are introduced and incorporated with the conservation equations that can be used to calculate and simulate the shock-induced reaction process. The energy that should be supplied to reach the transition state has been theoretically modeled by considering both the pore collapse mechanism and the plastic flow with increasing yield stress behind the shock wave. A non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework and the associated evolution equations are introduced to account for time delays that are observed in the experiments of shock-induced or assisted chemical reactions. An appropriate representation of the particle size effects is introduced by modifying the initial energy state of the reactants. Numerical results are presented for shock-induced reactions of mixtures of Al, Fe 2 O 3 and Ni, Al with epoxy as the binder. The theoretical model, in the continuum scale, requires parameters that should be experimentally determined. The experimental characterization has many challenges in measurement and development of nano instrumentation. An alternate approach to determine these parameters is through ab-initio calculations. Thus, this thesis has initiated ab-initio molecular dynamics studies of shock-induced chemical reactions. Specifically, the case of thermal initiation of chemical reactions in aluminum and nickel is considered.",2005
Apparatus for skidding sensitivity testing of energetic materials,"A remote-operated apparatus for testing the detonation sensitivity of energetic materials is detailed. Using an air ram and rotating disk, the normal force and transverse velocity of the impact plane are controlled independently, enabling the exploration of varying impact conditions over a wide parameter space. A microcontroller local to the apparatus is used to automate apparatus operation and ensure temporal alignment of the impacting ram head with the rotating disk. Calculation of the firing parameters and issuing of operational commands are handled by a remote computer and relayed to the local microcontroller for execution at the hardware level. Impact forces are taken from fast strain measurements obtained from gauges incorporated into the ram head. Infrared imaging of explosive samples provides insight into the peak thermal temperatures experienced at the sample surface during the impact event.",2021
Quantum-Informed Multiscale M&S for Energetic Materials,"A nonempirical, physics-based modeling and simulation (M&S) capability for energetic materials can only be obtained within a multiscale M&S framework that has a quantum mechanical foundation. In this chapter, quantum mechanical methods and applications to investigate these challenging materials will be given, along with descriptions of how these can be used to enable a quantum-informed multiscale M&S capability for energetic materials. Current capability gaps will be presented, along with suggestions for research advances needed to address these deficiencies.",2014
Predicting Physical and Chemical Behaviors of Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials (EMs) can release a large amount of energy by fast decomposing chemical reactions. The development of new generation EMs with decreased sensitivity, improved detonation performance and environmentally acceptance is of considerable importance for applications in civilian and military fields. Plenty of EMs are synthesized in labs through various ways, but few can satisfy the strict requirements of extended engineering applications. Particularly, the atomistic-level understanding of many fundamental issues related to thermal decomposition mechanisms and detonation properties of newly synthesized or long existing representative EMs remain unclear. Solving these fundamental problems is of great significance for proposing new generation of EMs prior to the difficult task of synthesis and for discovering new EMs that might optimize energy release, sensitivity, and environmental impact before expensive experimental tests. Here we focus on several typical EMs including silicon contained Si-PETN, three dimensional metal-organic frameworks of potassium 4,4’-bis(dinitromethyl)-3,3’- azofurazanate, cyclo-N 5 -contained EMs of [M(N 5 ) 2 (H 2 O) 4 ]·4H 2 O (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Zn), two nitro compound of nitromethane and nitryl cyanide, and methane hydrate. The summary of our studies on these materials are listed below. To understand the influence of elemental Si on the detonation properties of EMs, we carried out the combined reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) with quantum mechanics molecular dynamics (QMMD) simulations to predict the thermodynamics parameters of the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state as measurements of detonation performance. We found that the detonation temperature for tetrakis(nitratomethyl)silane (Si-PETN) is higher than that for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) because of high energy release while forming Si-based products. However, lower detonation pressure and detonation velocity for the Si-PETN system than those for PETN system were found because Si atoms attract nearby oxygen atoms from other molecules or fragments resulting in cluster products and leading to less gas product formation. This study uncovers how the specific atoms influence the detonation properties of EMs from the atomic perspective, providing useful information for designing EMs with improved properties. To understand the thermal stability and detonation properties of the new energetic three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we carried out quantum mechanics (QM) simulations to examine its initial decomposition mechanism and the Chapman Jouguet state for sustainable detonation. We found that the initial decomposition reaction is to break the C2N2O five-member ring in which K+ ions play a significant role in stabilizing the molecule structure, leading to an excellent thermal stability. Furthermore, this MOF system has a higher detonation velocity than lead azide, a comparable detonation pressure and temperature, and no toxic gases are produced at detonation. The combination of these detonation properties makes it a promising candidate for green EMs. Our results suggest that synthesizing 3D MOFs is an effective approach to develop environmentally acceptable alternatives to toxic EMs with enhanced thermal stability. To elucidate the high stability of the recently synthesized cyclo-N 5 -contained EMs of [M(N 5 ) 2 (H 2 O) 4 ]·4H 2 O (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Zn) under ambient conditions, QM calculations were employed. The results from our study indicate that the stability is due to the presence of two types of water (coordinated H 2 O (c-H 2 O) and hydrogen bonded H 2 O (h-H 2 O)). On the basis of the lower energy cost to remove h-H 2 O from the materials and the subsequent large decrease in the energy barrier, we propose that h-H 2 O acts as a “safety device” that prevents the materials from becoming kinetically unstable. To study the influence of additives to the detonation properties of nitromethane (NM), the simplest EM, we employed RMD with QMMD procedure to compare the detonation properties of liquid NM with the 1:1 molar ratio mixture of NM: NCNO 2 (recently synthesized). We found that the mixture significantly improved detonation properties including Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) temperature, CJ pressure, and detonation velocity. This is because the number of nitrogen atoms increases the gaseous final products while producing fewer carbon clusters. The detonation properties are also enhanced by the increased initial density leading to higher gas expansion capability. Thus, our results indicate that NCNO 2 is a good additive to NM or a suitable replacement for liquid NM due to its simple molecular structure, huge energy release and excellent detonation performance under low temperature conditions. To understand the diffusion and decomposition mechanism of trapped molecules in methane hydrates (MHs), we employed the QM simulations. We found that the initial decomposition reaction in MHs initiates from hydrogen transfer among water molecules. Then the attacks from fragments of O and OH to CH 4 molecules are responsible for the destructions of the methane molecules. Next, our simulation results revealed that the methane molecule prefer to escape from the ice cage through the hexagonal face. To suppress the methane diffusion, we demonstrated that the diffusion barrier is significantly enhanced by adding electron or hole carriers. This is because that the extra electrons and holes enhance the electrostatic interaction between methane and water molecules, leading to the increased barriers. Thus, the clathrate hydrates could be stabilized by adding extra free electron or hole carriers",2020
Pentazadiene: a high-nitrogen linkage in energetic materials,"A novel N-5-linear energetic moiety of pentazadiene has been constructed for the first time from a triazene precursor. Thus, a series of 1,3,5-tri(tetrazol-5-yl) pentaza-1,4-dienes have been synthesized in moderate to high yields by treatment of 1,3-bis(tetr-azol-5-yl) triazenes with 1(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) under mild conditions. All compounds were fully characterized using IR spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, HRMS, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and, in the case of 1,3,5-tri(2-methyltetrazol-5-yl) pentaza-1,4-diene (2a) together with single crystal X-ray structuring and N-15 NMR spectroscopy. Calculations predict that 2a has a heat of formation of 1699.2 kJ mol (1).",2017
Environmentally compatible next generation green energetic materials (GEMs),"This paper briefly reviews the literature work reported on the environmentally compatible green energetic materials (GEMs) for defence and space applications. Currently, great emphasis is laid in the field of high-energy materials (HEMs) to increase the environmental stewardship along with the deliverance of improved performance. This emphasis is especially strong in the areas of energetic materials, weapon development, processing, and disposal operations. Therefore, efforts are on to develop energetic materials systems under the broad concept of green energetic materials (GEMs) in different schools all over the globe. The GEMs program initiated globally by different schools addresses these challenges and establishes the framework for advances in energetic materials processing and production that promote compliance with environmental regulations.

Multimillion atom reactive simulations of nanostructured energetic materials,"For large-scale atomistic simulations involving chemical reactions to study nanostructured energetic materials, we have designed linear-scaling molecular dynamics algorithms: 1) first-principles-based fast reactive force field molecular dynamics, and 2) embedded divide-and-conquer density functional theory on adaptive multigrids for quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics. These algorithms have achieved unprecedented scales of quantum-mechanically accurate and well validated, chemically reactive atomistic simulations [0.56 billion-atom first principles-based fast reactive force field molecular dynamics and 1.4 million-atom (0.12 trillion grid points) embedded divide-and-conquer density functional theory, molecular dynamics] in addition to 18.9 billion-atom nonreactive space-time multiresolution molecular dynamics, with parallel efficiency as high as 0.953 on 1920 Itanium2 processors. These algorithms have enabled us to perform reactive molecular dynamics simulations to reveal various atomistic processes during 1) the oxidation of an aluminum nanoparticle, 2) the decomposition and chemisorption of an RDX (1, 3, 5-trinitro-1, 3, 5-triazine) molecule on an aluminum surface, and 3) shock-initiated detonation of energetic nanocomposite material (RDX,crystalline matrix embedded with aluminum nanoparticles.",2007
Enhancing reactivity of aluminum-based structural energetic materials,"Reactive metals are routinely added in applications such as propellants and explosives to increase energy density and total energy output. These materials are also becoming useful in warhead casings compared to traditional inert materials because of their ability to enhance weapon output such as peak blast pressure and blast impulse. Aluminum is a good candidate for such enhanced blast applications involving structural reactive warhead casings due to its high combustion enthalpy; however, under explosive loading, conventional aluminum casings expend little of the energetic potential stored within the material. In addition, aluminum casings are capable of producing large fragments (on the order of mm's) which can be difficult to ignite and are accelerated away from the target, lending no additional reaction enhancement to the initial blast. This study aims to determine the most effective methods of increasing the reactivity of aluminum warhead casings through modification of alloy composition and casing geometry using controlled explosive initiation experiments. The study also explores effects of explosive end confinement and impact induced fragment reactions. Transient and quasi-static pressure measurements, high speed imaging, and spatially-varying spectroscopy are performed to determine the effectiveness of reaction enhancement for each alloy. In addition, analysis of coarse and fine fragments collected during experiments provides insight into the role of fragmentation size and distribution on reactivity enhancement of the aluminum materials. Generation of fine particles below 10 microns during initial fragmentation is believed to play a key role in the casing reactivity enhancement immediately following the high explosive detonation.",2015
Miniaturized calorimeter for thermal screening of energetic materials,"The use of chip-scale calorimeters for research and development has increased during the last two decades. The high sensitivity of these devices allows their use for characterization of very small amounts of sample. However, the potential for using them for screening of highly energetic materials (i.e., explosives) has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present the design aspects of two chip-scale calorimeter prototypes based on thick silicon membranes for liquid and solid thermal characterizations. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to produce a portable calorimeter that can be incorporated as a new approach for detection of highly energetic materials such as explosives based on the information obtained from the calorimeter. The concept of this application is that indirect detection via the determination of thermal energy released in exothermic reactions can be detected by chip-scale calorimetric sensors. Details about the calorimeter design using finite element analysis are presented along with the fabrication procedure of the proposed sensor. Finally, preliminary results that provide experimental validation of the device design are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010
Domain partitioning material point method for simulating shock in polycrystalline energetic materials,"Heterogeneous energetic materials (EMs) subjected to mechanical shock loading exhibit complex thermo-mechanical processes which are driven by the high temperature, pressure, and strain rate behind the shock. These lead to spatial energy localization in the microstructure, colloquially known as ""hotspots"" where chemistry may commence and possibly culminating in detonation. Shock-induced pore collapse is one of the dominant mechanisms by which localization occurs. In order to physically predict the shock sensitivity of energetic materials under these extreme conditions, we formulate a multiplicative crystal plasticity model with key features inferred from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Within the framework of thermodynamics, we incorporate the pressure dependence of both monoclinic elasticity and critical resolved shear stress into the crystal plasticity formulation. Other fundamental mechanisms, such as strain hardening and pressure-dependent melting curves, are all inferred from atomic-scale computations performed across relevant intervals of pressure and temperature. To handle the extremely large deformation and the evolving geometry of the self-contact due to pore collapse, we leverage the capabilities of the Material Point Method (MPM) to track the interface via the Lagrangian motion of material points and the Eulerian residual update to avoid the mesh distortion issue. This combination of features enables us to simulate the shock-induced pore collapse and associated hotspot evolution with a more comprehensive physical underpinning, which we apply to the monoclinic crystal beta-HMX. Treating MD predictions of the pore collapse as ground truth,head-to-head validation comparisons between MD and MPM predictions are made for samples with identical sample geometry and similar boundary conditions for reverse-ballistic impact speeds ranging from 0.5 km s-1 to 2.0 km s-1. Comparative studies are performed to reveal the importance of incorporating a frictional contact algorithm, pressure-dependent elastic stiffness, and non-Schmid critical resolved shear stress in the mesoscale model.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Mixed-Metallic Energetic Metal-Organic Framework: New Structure Motif for Potential Heat-Resistant Energetic Materials,"The incessant pursuit of heat-resistant explosives with balanced energetic performance and safety is indispensable in civil and military sectors, particularly when employed in harsh environments. Herein, a new nanostructured highly energetic metal-organic framework (E-MOF), based on nickel(II) and sodium(I) mixed-metal has been constructed using an energetic poly tetrazole molecule by the hydrothermal approach. The Na/Ni-MOF was thoroughly characterized using infrared radiation (IR), thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction analyses. Further, the crystal structure was authenticated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and their crystal packing features were well explored, revealing a wave-like 3D framework having a crystal density of 1.985 g cm(-3). This mixed-metallic E-MOF demonstrated a good enthalpy of combustion (-7.91 kJ g(-1)), a good velocity of detonation (VOD = 7410 m s(-1)) exceeding that of trinitrotoluene (TNT, 6820 m/s) and Hexanitrostilbene (HNS, 7164 m/s), and excellent insensitivity [impact sensitivity (IS) > 40 J and friction sensitivity (FS) > 360 N]. Additionally, it exhibits outstanding thermal stability (T-d = 387 degrees C). These fine-tuned properties are superior to those of continuously used benchmark heat-resistant explosives HNS and 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, suggesting that the newly reported poly tetrazole-based E-MOF is beneficial for improved physical performance. The results given in the present work highlighted the advantages of the mixed-metallic E-MOF as a potential heat-resistant explosive for future applications.",2024
Compatibility Study of DNTF with Some Insensitive Energetic Materials and Inert Materials,"The compatibility of 3,4-dinitrofurazanfuroxan (DNTF) with insensitive energetic materials and inert materials was studied in detail using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TATB), 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyridine-1-oxide (ANPyO), and 5-amino-1H-tetrazole nitrate (5-ATEZN) are used as insensitive energetic materials, and polymer(vinyl acetate) (PVAC), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), dinoctylsebacate (DOS), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and wax are used as inert materials. The results show that DNTF/TNT and DNTF/5-ATEZN possess good compatibility, DNTF/NTO and DNTF/TATB have moderate compatibility, and the compatibility of DNTF/LLM-105 and DNTF/PVAC is poor; in addition, DNTF/ANPyO, DNTF/HTPB, DNTF/DNT, DNTF/DOS, and DNTF/wax have bad compatibility.",2016
New NHNO,"Electrostatic potential analysis of molecular surface with the aid of B3LYP, B3PW91 and M06-2X density functional methods was used to estimate the crystal density and enthalpy of sublimation of a series of borazine-based energetic compounds containing nitramino (-NHNO2) substituent. The calculated enthalpy of sublimation was combined with the gas phase enthalpy of formation to predict the solid phase enthalpy of formation. These data in conjugation with the molecular composition of mentioned compounds were used for evaluating the detonation characteristics using Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equation of state. The crystal density, detonation velocity and detonation pressure of nitramino-borazines are in the range of 1.373-1.832 g/cm(3), 7274-7851 m/s and 215-261 kbar, respectively. The enthalpies of formation of these compounds are negative, which indicate high thermodynamic stability of nitraminoborazines. Addition of -NHNO2 group to B-substituted borazines including -NO2 and -N-3 groups increases the thermodynamic stability of desired compound, whereas they have reverse effect on the N-substituted ones. The molecular structure of novel -NHNO2 substituted borazine-based high energy materials containing -N-3 groups with greater performance than conventional organic nitramines i.e. tetryl, DNNT, DANT, RDX and HMX, were also presented. These compounds have high detonation velocity, i.e. near 10,000 m/s. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
Theoretical insight into different energetic groups on the performance of energetic materials featuring RDX ring,"Thirty nitramines by incorporating ?NHNH2, ?N3, ?NH2, ?NHNO2, ?C??O, ?NF2, ?ONO2, ?NO2, ?C (NO2)3, and ?CH(NO2)2 groups to RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane) framework were designed. Their electronic structures, heats of formation (HOF), detonation properties, thermal stabilities, thermodynamic properties, and electrostatic potential were systematically investigated by density functional theory. The effects of different substituents on the performance of energetic materials were studied, showing that the number of nitrogen atom in substituted groups plays a critical role in determining HOFs, Thermal dynamic parameters, such as standard molar heat capacity (C?p,m), standard molar entropy (S?m) and standard molar enthalpy (H?m) increased with the increasing number of energetic groups, and the volume of energetic groups have a great effect on standard molar enthalpy. Compared to the traditional energetic compound RDX, all designed molecules have similar or better density, detonation properties, and oxygen balance. Among them, D2 has extraordinary high detonation performance (D = 11.44 km s-1, P = 64.54 GPa), A3 has relatively poor detonation performance (D = 8.85 km s- 1, P = 36.70 GPa), and ?NF2 and ?C(NO2)3 are the best groups in increasing density by more or less six percent.",2021
Theoretical studies on energetic properties of ,"A series of s-triazine substituted aminofurazan and aminofuroxan derivatives are investigated theoretically as potential high energy density materials (HEDMs). The crystal density, condensed heat of formation (HOF), detonation performance, acceleration ability, and critical pressure of initiation are estimated using empirical relationships. It is shown that the title compounds are characterized by high HOFs (817-4067 kJ/kg) and crystal density values (1.76-1.95 g/cm(3)). The calculated detonation performance shows that derivatives substituted with -N-3 and -C(NO2)(3) are potential candidates for future HEDMs. Moreover, the values of the critical pressure of initiation indicate that furoxan derivatives are more sensitive to shock and impact compared to their furazan counterparts and that, for the substitutes -NH2 or nitrogen-containing heterocycles, a similar or lower impact sensitivity than that of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) can be obtained.",2014
Methodologies for Characterization of Aerospace Polymers/Energetic Materials – a Short Review,"ABSTRACT Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques, associated or not to others, are a well-studied subject used for characterizing polymers/energetic materials that have been employed mainly in aerospace industries. However, the infrared analyses are usually qualitative and performed using the mid-infrared. This paper discusses the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy qualitative and quantitative methodologies, coupled or not with thin layer chromatography and thermogravimetric analysis, for characterization of aerospace polymer systems, in some cases, using mid-infrared, near-infrared and far-infrared regions, by traditional accessories and the latest generation spectra mode, universal attenuated total reflection. This short review was made based on methodologies developed during the last two decades and published by many scientific and industrial research groups, emphasizing studies usually carried out in the last five years. A critical assessment and future trends were included.",6-03
Titanium(II) as a Fuel Atom in Energetic Materials,"Combustioncalorimetry on synthetic coordination complexesdemonstrates Ti-II is a potent fuel ion that can be incorporatedinto energetic molecules. Theenergetic content of the compounds MgTp(2), FeTp(2), MnTp(2), and TiTp(2) is measured by bombcalorimetry and compared to theoretical calculations (Tp = trispyrazoylborate).TiTp(2) had the largest heat of combustion of the four compounds.Comparison of the heat of combustion of the Ti complex to those ofMg and Mn complexes suggests an effective combustion energy of Ti-II of between 1400 and 3000 kJ/mol, affirming the role of Ti-II as a strong fuel atom.",2023
Laser-induced Deflagration for the Characterization of Energetic Materials,"Standard propellant and detonation tests typically performed to characterize the performance of energetic materials require large quantities of material (at least tens of grams) and can be expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a method for characterizing the deflagration of energetic materials in a laboratory setting, using only 15-20mg of energetic material. Temperature, energy release and emission signatures were measured and analyzed for the laser-induced deflagration of 8 different conventional military explosives. Graphite nanoparticles and micron-sized aluminum powder were added to the explosive compositions to investigate their effect on the emission signatures. A high-speed color camera recorded the deflagration events and was utilized as a full-color pyrometer to calculate the average temperatures and image hotspots; the temperatures maps were compared to those measured by conventional two-color pyrometry. The laboratory-scale method presented here can be applied to novel energetic materials under development that may be available only in limited quantities to evaluate their potential as propellants or reduced emission signature explosives prior to scale-up.",2017
High-pressure computational and experimental studies of energetic materials,"On account of the high temperatures and pressures experienced by energetic materials during deflagration and detonation, it is important to know not only the physical properties of these materials at ambient temperatures and pressures, but also to understand how their structure and properties are affected by extreme conditions. Combined computational and experimental investigations of the effects of high pressures on the structure and properties of several energetic materials are described herein. A comparison of the performances of different pseudopotentials and density functional theory (DFT) dispersion correction schemes in calculating crystal geometries and vibrational frequencies of crystalline ammonium perchlorate at high pressure is described. The results highlight the fact that care must be taken when choosing pseudopotentials for high-pressure studies. A comprehensive comparison of calculated vibrational modes (including symmetry) with experiment has been performed, with the frequencies of all internal modes predicted to lie within 5% of experimental values. This study established that no significant improvements in the calculation of crystal geometries of ammonium perchlorate are obtained by employing DFT-D corrections. The enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus) of the highly metastable β-form of RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) was determined to be 12.63 ± 0.28 kJ mol-1. DFT-D calculations of the lattice energies of the α- and β-forms of RDX are described. Furthermore, the response of the lattice parameters and unit-cell volumes to pressure for the α-, γ- and ε-forms of RDX calculated using DFT-D are in very good agreement with experimental data. Phonon calculations provide good agreement with vibrational frequencies obtained from Raman spectroscopy, and a predicted inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectrum of α-RDX shows excellent agreement with experimental INS data recorded as part of this study. The results of the high-pressure phonon calculations have been used to show that the heat capacities of the α-, γ- and ε- forms of RDX are only weakly affected by pressure. DFT-D calculations have been utilised to describe accurately the structure and properties of both β-HMX (Cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine) and α-FOX-7 (1,1-Diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene) as a function of pressure. This work presents data for the experimental hydrostatic compression of both deuterated β-HMX and α-FOX-7 performed using neutron powder diffraction at the ISIS Neutron and Muon facility, in addition to experimental determinations of the INS spectra of both β-HMX and α-FOX-7. The DFT-D hydrostatic compression studies for both materials reproduce the experimental compression trends. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational properties as a function of pressure were in very good agreement with available experimental data. The results of the phonon calculations were then used to predict the effect of pressure on the heat capacities of β-HMX and α-FOX-7. These predictions suggest a very weak pressure dependence of heat capacities (approximately -1 J K-1 mol-1 GPa-1) for these materials. This work demonstrates that the DFT-D model performs extremely well over a range of conditions, and is able to describe accurately intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and thus the structure and properties of organic molecular nitramine crystals. The computational model was therefore used to predict the high-pressure hydrostatic compression behaviour of a related nitramine, CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-Hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane), the results of which highlighted possible discrepancies in the experimental high-pressure X-ray diffraction data recorded for ε-CL-20. This prompted a high-pressure neutron powder diffraction study, which showed good agreement with the computational results, thereby highlighting radiation damage in the X-ray experiments.",2013
Infrared Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Emissions from Energetic Materials,"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has shown great promise for applications in chemical, biological, and explosives (CBE) sensing and has significant potential for real time standoff detection and analysis. We have studied LIBS emissions in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region for potential applications in CBE sensing. Detailed MIR-LIBS studies were performed for several energetic materials for the first time. In this study, the IR signature spectral region between 4 - 12 mu m was mined for the appearance of MIR-LIBS emissions that are directly indicative of oxygenated breakdown products as well as partially dissociated and recombination molecular species.",2011
Nitramines with Varying Sensitivities: Functionalized Dipyrazolyl- N-nitromethanamines as Energetic Materials,"1,3-Dichloro-2-nitro-2-azapropane is an excellent precursor to dense energetic functionalized dipyrazolyl-N-nitromethanamines. This new family of energetic compounds was fully characterized by using 1H, 13C, and 15NNMR and IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and impact sensitivity tests. Additionally, single-crystal X-ray structuring was done for 3 and 5CH3CN, which gave insight into structural characteristics. The experimentally determined densities of 2-9 fall between 1.69 and 1.90gcm-3. Heats of formation and detonation properties were calculated by using Gaussian03 and EXPLO5 programs, respectively. The influence of different energetic moieties on the structural and energetic properties was established theoretically.",2013
Numerical framework for mesoscale simulation of heterogeneous energetic materials,"Heterogeneous energetic materials such as plastic bonded explosives (PBX), pressed explosives etc. have very detailed and non-uniform microstructure. The heterogeneities are usually present in the form of binder, voids, microcracks etc. Shock interaction with these heterogeneities leads to local heated regions known as hot spots. It is widely accepted that these hot spots are predominantly the cause of triggering reaction and eventually ignition in these energetic materials. There are various physical mechanisms operating at mesoscale through which hot spot can be created such as void collapse, inter-granular friction in energetic crystals, shock heating of HMX crystals and binder etc. Hence, microstructural heterogeneities can play a vital role for shock initiation in heterogeneous explosives. In the current work, a general framework is established for performing mesoscale simulations on heterogeneous energetic materials. The numerical framework is based on a massively parallel Cartesian grid based Eulerian solver. Narrow band level set approach is used for sharp tracking of the material interfaces. The interfacial conditions are applied using modified ghost fluid method. The use of level set method for interface tracking provides an inherent advantage of using level set based image segmentation algorithm (active contouring) for the representation of explosives microstructure. The image processing approach allows to perform simulation on real geometries than the idealized shapes. The image processing framework is incorporated in the Eulerian solver. The energetic material considered in the current work is HMX. The chemical decomposition of HMX is modeled using Henson Smilowitz chemical kinetic law. Shock analysis is performed on two different samples of HMX based pressed explosives. Also, both two dimensional and three dimensional shock analysis on mock sugar geometry are performed. The effect of shock strength and relative positioning of voids on ignition threshold of porous HMX is studied. The current work is focused towards the development of a computational framework which can replicate the experimental way of studying the shock initiation behavior of energetic materials i.e. using flyer plate simulations.",2015
Hydrothermal conversion of biomass to fuels and energetic materials,"Available biomass, preferentially residues, can be divided in two groups: biomass with a high or natural water content ('wet' or 'green' biomass) and biomass with low water content such as wood and straw. In 'dry' biomass gasification processes, originating in most coal processing technologies, biomass of low water content is necessary to avoid the energy loss by water evaporation. In contrast, hydrothermal processes need water as reaction medium; therefore, these processes are preferentially used for wet or 'green' biomass.In this review paper we will describe the main research directions in the hydrothermal conversion of biomass into fuels and carbon throughout gasification to produce H-2 or CH4, liquefaction to produce crude oils and phenols from lignin as well as carbonization to produce carbonaceous materials which can be either used as fuels (carbon negative chars) or interesting energetic materials (hydrothermal carbons).",2013
Thermal Energetic Reactor with High Reproduction of Fission Materials,"Existing thermal reactors are energy production scale limited because of low portion of raw uranium usage. Fast reactors are limited by reprocessing need of huge mass of raw uranium at the initial stage of development. The possibility of development of thermal reactors with high fission materials reproduction, which solves the problem, is discussed here. Neutron losses are decreased, uranium-thorium fuel with artificial fission materials equilibrium regime is used, additional in-core and out-core neutron sources are used for supplying of high fission materials reproduction. Liquid salt reactors can use dynamic loading regime for this purpose. Preferable construction is channel type reactor with heavy water moderator. Good materials for fuel element shells and channel walls are zirconium alloys enriched by Zr-90. Water cooled reactors with usage 12% of raw uranium and liquid metal cooled reactors with usage 25% of raw uranium are discussed. Reactors with additional neutron sources obtain full usage of raw uranium with small additional energy expenses. On the base of thermal reactors with high fission materials reproduction world atomic power engineering development supplying higher power and requiring smaller speed of raw uranium mining, than in the variant with fast reactors, is possible.",2012
Composite Energetic Materials Containing Nitrotriazalone Formed by Molecular Inclusion,"The explosive properties of inclusion compounds containing the monoanion of the energetic compound 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO-) non-covalently bound to either of two larger, energetic, receptor complexes, namely 1-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecanezinc(II) or 1-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecanecopper(II), both as their monoperchlorate salts, are reported. The sensitivity of the receptor host guest complexes to electrostatic discharge or friction was not found to differ from that displayed by the separate components. However, for thermal sensitivity it was found that whereas NTO- desensitized the Zn(II) receptor complex it sensitized the Cu(II) receptor complex. For sensitivity to impact, measured using the Rotter impact test, it was found that NTO- sensitized the Zn(II) receptor complex, but desensitized the Cu(II) receptor complex.",2011
New pyrazole energetic materials and their energetic salts: combining the dinitromethyl group with nitropyrazole,"In this work, a series of pyrazole-derived energetic compounds were successfully synthesized. These energetic compounds were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structures of compounds 5, 6, 7 and 7a were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical and energetic properties of all synthesized energetic compounds, including density, thermal stability and energetic performance, were investigated. The structure-property relationship was illustrated using two-dimensional fingerprint plots based on Hirshfeld surfaces, NCI plots and ESP of 7 and 7a. Among these energetic compounds, the hydroxylammonium salt 7b exhibited satisfactory calculated detonation performance (8700 m s(-1)), which was comparable to the commonly used highly explosive RDX (8748 m s(-1)). The potassium salt 5 was tested for its detonation ability by detonating RDX. The result indicates that compound 5 could be used as a potential green primary explosive.",2020
Molecular dynamics application of cocrystal energetic materials: A review,"Cocrystallization is an important method to obtain high-energy and low-sensitivity explosives. Therefore, the synthesis, structures, and properties of cocrystal energetic materials have become a highly active research topic. Studying the physical and chemical properties of cocrystal energetic materials by molecular dynamics is of great significance for the in-depth understanding and design/synthesis of new cocrystal energetic materials.

Passivation and Stabilization of Aluminum Nanoparticles for Energetic Materials,"In aircraft applications, fuel is used not only as a propellant but also as a coolant and improving both the thermal conductivity and combustion enthalpy of the fuel is beneficial in these applications. These properties can be enhanced by dispersing aluminum nanoparticles into the fuel; however, the nanoparticles require stabilization from agglomeration and passivation from oxidation in order for these benefits to be realized in aircraft applications. To provide this passivation and stabilization, aluminum nanoparticles were encapsulated with a coating by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) method from toluene precursors. The thermal conductivity, combustion and ignition properties, and stability of the nanoparticles dispersed in RP-2 fuel were subsequently evaluated. In addition, the effect of dispersing aluminum nanoparticles in RP-2 fuel on the erosion rate of fuel nozzles was evaluated. The dispersion of PE-CVD coated aluminum nanoparticles at a concentration of 3.0% by volume exhibited a 17.7% and 0.9% increase in thermal conductivity and volumetric enthalpy of combustion, respectively, compared to the baseline RP-2 fuel. Additionally, particle size analysis (PSA) of the PE-CVD coated aluminum nanofuel exhibited retention of particle size over a five-month storage period and erosion testing of a 1 mm stainless steel nozzle exhibited a negligible 1% change in discharge coefficient after 100 hours of testing.",2015
Synthesis of Heterocyclic Ylids as Candidates for Energetic Materials,"Concise syntheses of nitrogen-rich pyridinium and 1,2,4-triazolium N-imides are reported.

Computational study of imidazole derivative as high energetic materials,"Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for a series of imidazole derivatives. B3LYP and B3P86 functionals with 6-31G** basis set were used. Heats of formation (HOFs) were predicted through designed isodesmic reactions. Calculated results show that the HOFs relate to the number and the position of nitro groups. The HOFs increase with the augment of the number of the NO2 group for the direct imidazole derivatives and decrease with the augment of the number of the NO2 group for 1-picrylimidazole derivatives. Thermal stabilities were evaluated via bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The result shows that the increase of nitro group number on imidazole ring reduces the stability of the molecule. Further, the correlation was developed between impact sensitivity h(50) and the ratio (BDE/E) of the weakest bond BDE to the total energy E. The detonation performance data were also calculated.

Noncovalent Interactions and Crystal Structure Prediction of Energetic Materials,"The crystal and molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and energy of CL-20, HATO, and FOX-7 were comparatively predicted based on molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. By comparison, the 2D fingerprint plot, Hirshfeld surface, reduced density gradient isosurface, and electrostatic potential surface were studied to detect the intermolecular interactions. Meanwhile, the effects of vacuum and different solvents on the crystal habit of CL-20, HATO, and FOX-7 were studied by AE and MAE model, respectively. The energy calculation was also analysed based on the equilibrium structures of these crystal models by MD simulations. Our results would provide fundamental insights for the crystal engineering of energetic materials.",2022
Optical Fiber Metrology for Detonation Characterization of Energetic Materials,"Detonation metrology is essential for the development of energetic materials, to characterize existing explosives, and to characterize materials behavior under high pressures. This work aimed to develop detonation metrology based on optical fibers that is independent of the radiation generated from the detonation and/or shock process, as well as based on a light converting system that is not expensive and which signals are easy to read. To achieve these objectives, multimode PMMA optical fibers (250 μm diameter) working as bare probes or protected probes, with stainless steel tubes, were tested. Two working methods, in terms of radiation generation, were applied and discussed. In the optical passive method (OPM), the optical fiber probes capture the radiation generated by the detonation/shock process, originating a positive electrical signal. The optical active method (OAM) consists of transmitting laser radiation (660 nm) through the optical fiber probes that lose their transmission properties when shocked by a detonation or shock wave, which originate negative electrical signals. The different probes and methods were used to determine detonation velocity and pressure of Seismoplast, a PETN-based explosive with a density of 1.56 g/cm 3 . The different methods and probes were extensively studied to determine their limitations. These limitations make that different probes have to be used on the OAM, according to the parameter that is desired to measure and to the shape of the charge. To find the P CJ , the movements x(t) of the shock waves generated by the detonation of Seismoplast in three inert materials were characterized. With the explosive/inert material interface shock velocities were possible to find the pressures and particle velocities and, through the impedance matching technique (IMT) it was determined the CJ pressure of Seismoplast. For rectangular cross-section charges using the OPM with the two different probes, the detonation velocities obtained ranged from 7237 to 7336 m/s, with standard deviations between 1.1 and 6.0 %; for the active optical method, the experimental results for detonation velocity varied between 7258 and 7367 m/s and were obtained with a standard deviation range of 0.6 to 1.7 %. The OAM with bare optical probes was used to measure the induced shock wave velocities generated by Seismoplast on different thicknesses of PMMA (1–9 mm), aluminum, and copper (1–7 mm). Based on the shock wave velocities at the interfaces between the explosive and the inert barriers, the CJ pressure of Seismoplast was determined as 21.2 GPa. Based on the CJ point ( P CJ , uP, CJ) and an empirical method proposed by Cooper, it was possible to estimate the Hugoniot of detonation products of Seismoplast. The OAM, with bare and protected optical probes, was used to determine the detonation velocity of two other compositions, HWC (based on RDX) with a density of 1.68 g/cm 3 , and TKX-50, an energetic ionic salt with a density of 1.70 g/cm 3 . This method with bare optical probes was also used to estimate the detonation pressure of TKX-50. A metrologia da detonação é essencial para o desenvolvimento de materiais energéticos, para a caracterização dos explosivos existentes, e para caracterizar o comportamento dos materiais sobre altas pressões. Este trabalho teve como objectivo desenvolver uma metrologia de detonação baseada em fibras ópticas que é independente da radiação gerada pelo processo de detonação/choque, e que incorpora um conjunto de componentes para o sistema de conversão optoeléctrico relativamente simples. As sondas utilizadas nesta metrologia são baseadas em fibras ópticas multimode de PMMA (250 μm de diâmetro). Estas sondas consistiram em fibras ópticas desprotegidas, ou protegidas com tubos de aço inox. Foram aplicados e discutidos dois métodos de funcionamento desta metrologia, em termos da radiação gerada. No método óptico passivo (MOP), as sondas de fibra óptica capturam a radiação gerada pelo processo de detonação/choque, dando origem a um sinal eléctrico positivo. O método óptico activo (MOA) consiste na transmissão de radiação laser (660 nm) através das sondas de fibra óptica, as quais perdem a capacidade de transmissão quando são chocadas por uma onda de detonação ou de choque, originando sinais eléctricos negativos. Os métodos foram testados na determinação da velocidade ( D ) e pressão ( P CJ ) de detonação do Seismoplast, um explosivo baseado em PETN com densidade de 1.56 g/cm 3 . Os diferentes métodos e sondas foram estudados intensivamente para determinar as suas limitações, as quais fazem com que tenham de ser usadas sondas diferentes no MOA, de acordo com o parâmetro que é desejado medir. Para determinar a P CJ foi necessário caracterizar o movimento x(t) da onda de choque gerada pela detonação do Seismoplast em três materiais inertes diferentes. Com as velocidades de choque nas interfaces explosivo/material inerte foi possível calcular as respectivas pressões e velocidades do ponto material e, através da técnica de adaptação de impedâncias, obteve-se a pressão de CJ do Seismoplast. Quando se utilizou o MOP em cargas de secção rectangular com os dois tipos diferentes de sondas, as velocidades de detonação medidas variaram entre 7237 to 7336 m/s, com desvios padrões entre 1.1 e 6%; para o MOA, os resultados experimentais da velocidade de detonação variaram entre 7258 e 7367 m/s, com desvios padrões a variar entre 0.6 e 1.7%. OMOA com sondas de fibras ópticas desprotegidas foi utilizado para determinar a velocidade da onda de choque induzida pelo Seismoplast em função das espessuras de PMMA, alumínio e cobre. Com base nas velocidades da onda de choque calculadas nas interfaces explosivo/barreira inerte, o resultado para a pressão de CJ do Seismoplast foi de 21.2 GPa. A partir da determinação do ponto de CJ ( P CJ, uP, CJ) e do método empírico proposto por Cooper, foi possível estimar a curva de Hugoniot para os produtos de detonação do Seismoplast.",2021
Review on Advanced Energetic Materials for Insensitive Munition Formulations,"Insensitive munitions are munitions that are chemically stable enough to withstand thermal, mechanical, or electrical stimuli during storage and transportation, and can still explode as intended to defeat their targets. Extensive programmes have evolved worldwide for the development and introduction of insensitive munitions (IMs). The use of insensitive energetic materials significantly improves the protection of modern nuclear warheads and increases the survivability of conventional munitions in hustle environment. The most basic level to obtain insensitive munitions is the use of intrinsic insensitive energetic materials, either by synthesizing new, less sensitive crystalline materials or by improving the physical properties of existing sensitive materials. In light of the growing importance of insensitive munitions, this review paper brings out some potential insensitive energetic materials and plasticizers emphasizing their significant role in the development of futuristic IM formulations. This review also concisely brings out the recent work carried out globally, including India, on the development of advanced energetic materials and their insensitive energetic formulations.",2020

Construction material energetic usefulness increasement peculiarities and its importance,"Extractive hemihydrate phosphogypsum taken directly from the waste disposal conveyer was used for the investigation. The phosphogypsum, Portland cement and opoka mixture was prepared by using the mechanical activation method. The obtained formation mass was used for formation of specimens by vibration and casting methods. The conducted experiments showed the possibility to reprocess phosphogypsum into a high-quality modified gypsum binding materials by using a centrifugal impact mechanical activation method, which allows to save the accumulated chemical waste energy. Activated phosphogypsum without additives distinquishes itself by very quick hardening, due to which there is no time left for further reprocessing operations, its compressive strength is lower than that for gypsum cement specimens. Portland cement and opoka mixture can effectively neutralize the phosphogypsum acidic admixtures and retard its binding and hardening duration. The compressive strength of gypsum cement specimens reached 22 MPa formed by vibration method and 17.5 MPa by casting.",2008
DETONATION SHOCK DYNAMICS FOR POROUS EXPLOSIVES AND ENERGETIC MATERIALS,An explosive powder subjected to mechanical or thermal loading undergoes microstructural changes that cause the density to increase and the material to be compacted. The energy that drives compaction is absorbed by the material as the microstructure changes and the specific internal energy of the solid-void mixture increases due to the increase in density as voids become occupied by solids. These changes affect the reactive properties of the material and the mechanics and dynamics of detonation waves in explosive powders. The effects of explosive powder compaction on detonation wave dynamics have not been well characterized. Here we use the theory of Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) to analyze the effects of compaction on the dynamics and geometry of detonation waves in explosive powders. We apply DSD theory using a simplified equation of state (EOS) that has been shown to represent the effects of compaction that lead to deflagration to detonation transition in explosive powders. We will show results from the numerical solution of the DSD theory equations as well as from asymptotic DSD theory.,2009
Improved Approach to Predict the Power of Energetic Materials,"Nowadays, the ballistic mortar is the preferred test for the explosive power measurements but there is no reliable method for its prediction. For an energetic compound, the formation of low molecular mass gaseous products and a high positive heat of formation per unit weight of the energetic compound are important parameters to have a high value of power. A novel method was developed to predict the power by the ballistic mortar test for pure and mixture of energetic materials. It can be used for some important classes of energetic compounds including nitroaromatics, acyclic and cyclic nitramines, nitrate esters, and nitroaliphatics. The presented method is based on the molecular structure of the desired compound and there is no need to use experimental data such as the condensed phase heat of formation. For 84 pure and 24mixtures of energetic compounds, the calculated power relative to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (=100) show good agreement with respect to the measured values.",2013
Charge Transport in Organic Materials With Small Energetic Disorder,"We have studied the charge carrier transport in organic semiconductors with high mobility close to the value, mu similar to 1cm(2)/Vs, using the Monte Carlo simulation. These organic semiconductors exhibit poly-crystal or liquid-crystal phase with high order. Although their conduction regime is explained by Marcus or Holstein type of small-polaron hopping (i.e., Arrhenius-type of temperature dependence of the mobility), we suggest that their charge hopping occurs in the presence of energetic-state disorder. The ""Gaussian disorder model"" (GDM) under the supposition of Gaussian-type of density of states (DOS) is first proposed by Bassler [1] for the explanation of the charge transport in amorphous organic semiconductors. Although the energetic disorder is very small (<= 50meV) in the present organic semiconductors, our simulation shows that the small value of energetic disorder affects temperature dependence of the mobility especially in low temperature domain (",2010
Energy transfer at gas -liquid interface: Towards energetic materials,"Physicochemical surface processes have great importance in the different fields of everyday life and science. Computational characterization of collisional energy transfer at a gas-liquid interface is a helpful tool to interpret recent experimental studies and to yield insight into the energy feedback mechanism of multiphase combustion problems. As a first step, a simple Lennard-Jones system was used to investigate the dependence of the collisional energy transfer and the gas atom trapping probabilities on the temperature of the bulk liquid, on the gas/liquid particle mass ratios, on the incident angle of the impinging projectile, and on the gas-liquid interaction strength. We find in accord with the experimental results that the kinematic effects dominate the energy transfer dynamics, but the importance of the role of surface roughening as the temperature of the liquid increases is also seen. The second system, nitromethane was chosen to extend the range of simulations. It is a molecular model system, representing nitramine-type energetic materials. Having had a good potential description for the nitromethane molecule including all internal degrees of freedom, we generated simplified molecular systems based on the original nitromethane model to isolate particular features of the dynamics. We have investigated the effect of the initial incident energy, of the inclusion of the internal degrees of freedom, of the initial incident kinetic energy and of the gas-surface interaction strength. The incorporation of internal degrees of freedom enhanced the collisional energy transfer. These calculations also point to the importance of simple kinematics as it predicts the increase of the ratio of energy transferred with increased initial incident energy of the gas particle.",2007
Ultrafast Broadband Midinfrared Absorption Spectroscopy on Shocked Energetic Materials,"Balancing increased safety against detonation performance is paramount for new explosive energetic materials in the development process. Often these two requirements are in opposition to each other. Sensitivity tests to external stimuli are used to determine how safe an energetic material is to phenomena such as impact, heat, or friction. Meanwhile, detonation performance is assessed by the maximum pressure and shock velocity induced from chemical reactions. Tailoring the performance while maintaining safety of the explosive would be possible with knowledge of the chemical reactions that functional groups provide during detonation. Current knowledge of the chemical reactions that occur during detonation is limited. Several mechanisms have been suggested for first step reactions throughout the detonation process for energetic molecules; however, no single chemical pathway has been irrefutably substantiated by experiments. Alternatively, models can provide insight into the types of reactions that may transpire, but lack direct experimental comparisons. If experiments and models could be compared at the equivalent time and length scales, then measurements could guide the physics and chemistry assumptions present in models. Experiments presented in this document bridge that gap by using an ultrafast laser system to generate shocks in samples and spectroscopically probe vibrational and electronic absorption changes that occur during shock compression. A review of how to turn a benchtop chirped pulse amplifier into a shock physics and chemistry laboratory is first presented. Applications of the spectroscopic techniques developed were then applied to trinitrotoluene (TNT) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) during shock compression. Mid-infrared absorption results for shock compressed TNT and PETN were compared to current suggestions on chemical pathways and inconsistencies were present for both materials. It is suggested that a carbon-carbon bond breaking mechanism is present for PETN, and a hydrogenic stretch like hydroxyl or amide bond formation mechanism is suggested for TNT based on the MIR absorption measurements.

Charge Dynamics and its Energetic Features in Polymeric Materials,"Modeling charge transport and linking charge dynamics with dissipative processes responsible for electrical ageing are a challenging objective for developing a mature approach in insulation design. Such an approach is exemplified here for polyethylene-based materials by introducing two models describing bipolar Space Charge Limited Current in transient and steady states. They rely on two classical descriptions of the distribution function of the energy levels of trap states -single trapping level or exponential distribution. Their predictions are discussed as regards the experimental behavior. They notably highlight the importance of recombination processes in explaining the sigmoidal shape of the steady-state current-voltage characteristic. Also, bipolar charge transport seems to be a necessary factor for the observed features of oscillatory charge packets. The energetic features of charge dynamics is reviewed with particular emphasis on recombination phenomena because the latter promote electronically excited states that are chemically reactive and could be involved in ageing reaction. The relationship between charge recombination and electroluminescence is highlighted through experiments and simulation. The spectral analysis of the emitted light advocates the existence of massive chemical/physical degradation in the electrical regime where recombination is a major factor of the Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC).",2013
Rapid analysis of energetic and geo-materials using LIBS,The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been used to analyze a diverse array of materials for several decades. LIBS is ideal for rapid materials analysis since data can be collected in real time with no sample preparation. The coupling of LIBS with multivariate analysis has increased in recent years and allows for rapid processing of spectral information for qualitative or quantitative analysis. We will discuss several examples of how LIBS and multivariate analysis has been used to classify geological and energetic materials at the United States Army Research Laboratory. It is important to understand the parameters that influence the results and the limitations of multivariate analysis for LIBS applications.,2011
Formation of heterogeneous energetic materials to regulate sensitivity of TATB by 2D materials,"The exploration of relationship between energetic density and stability is essential for the development of high energy density materials. Using the first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structures and effective masses of TATB/2D (graphene, MoS2, MoTe2, WS2) heterogeneous energetic materials. We find that the main contribution to the band gap decrease is due to the energy bands moving towards lower energy levels. The decreased effective mass with the increasing pressure is the same as the change of band gap, meaning that the decreased effective mass after heterogeneity is good for sensitization of energetic materials. The introduction of 2D materials into insensitive high explosives is a promising way to make controlled explosives.",2020
High Azide Content Hyperbranched Star Copolymer as Energetic Materials,"A series of star azide copolymers (b-POBs) with hyperbranched polyether cores (HBPO-c) and short linear poly(3,3'-bis-azidomethyl oxetane) arms (PBAMO-a) have been prepared. The polymers were characterized with FT-IR, H-1 NMR, quantitative C-13 NMR, gel permeation chromatography, MALDI-TOF, and X-ray diffractometry. Due to hyperbranched structures, the crystallinity (We) of b-POBs was significantly decreased, and the processability was greatly improved. The enthalpy of formation, obtained by oxygen bomb calorimetric measurements, high azide content, and heats of decomposition of b-POBs demonstrated their remarkable energy level. Furthermore, b-POBs had good resistance to pyrolysis up to 230 degrees C (T-5%), and their mechanical sensitivities were also obviously lower than that of the PBAMO homopolymer, showing their good safety properties. Moreover, the mechanism for sensitivity reduction of b-POBs was established by analyzing the relationship between the activation course in mechanical stimulus and its crystalline structure.",2018
Gels as Energy Dissipation Media for Energetic Materials Desensitization,"The hypothesis that gels, which have a variety of dissipation mechanisms in response to external forces can provide efficient energy deflection media protecting sensitive energetic materials from accidental initiation is explored. Entrapment of explosives, with an emphasis on peroxide materials, in gels is demonstrated as a general method to substantially lower explosives sensitivity diverting stimuli from the sensitive materials to the gel. Friction is a more difficult stimulus to dissipate in comparison to impact. The desensitization method developed, is with minimal material manipulations. Practical considerations as mode of application, solubility, and controlling speed of gelation determine that the method of choice is a sol-gel process using a mixture of three alkylalkoxysilanes, RnSi(OR')(4-n), producing a hybrid organic-inorganic gel enabling complete triacetone triperoxide (TATP) desensitization at 20-25% v/v concentrations.",2015
Theoretical studies on energetic materials bearing pentaflurosulphyl (SF,"Heats of formation (HOF) for a series of energetic materials containing SF5 group were studied by density functional theory. Results show that HOFs increase with the augmention of field effects of substituted groups. Addition of furazan or furoxan ring increases HOF of the energetic materials. All the SF5-containing compounds have densities which are similar to 0.19 g/cm(3) higher than those containing -NH2 group. S-F bond is the trigger bond for the thermolysis process in the title compounds and bond dissociation energies of the weakest bonds range from 351.1 to 388.3 kJ/mol. Detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) are evaluated by Kamlet-Jacobs equations with the calculated densities and HOFs. Results show that increasing the amount of furazan rings results in a larger D and P. Considering the detonation performance and thermal stability, eight compounds may be considered as potential candidates for high-energy density materials.",2014
Particle size effects on thermal decomposition of energetic material,"This work refers to a study of the thermal decomposition of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nonisothermal conditions, with heating rates from 5 to 20 degrees Cmin(-1). The influence of the particle size in the thermal decomposition of HMX was verified. The activation energy for the decomposition of each sample was calculated using the peak temperature shift methods, proposed by Kissinger and Ozawa. A significant variation in the results was observed according to the range of the particle size used. The results showed that, as the particle size of HMX increased, the thermal decomposition temperature of HMX and the decompositional activation energies ranges enhanced. At the same time, at a constant heating rate, the decomposition temperatures of the smaller particles were lower than those of larger ones. The critical temperature for thermal explosion of each sample was calculated. Also, the values of Delta S#, Delta H#, and Delta G# of reaction for each particle size were computed.",2008
Prediction of the Density of Energetic Co-crystals: a Way to Design High Performance Energetic Materials,"For designing a new energetic material with good performance, a knowledge of its density is required. In this study, the relationship between the densities of energetic co-crystals and their molecular structures was examined through a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) method. The methodology of this research provides a new model which can relate the density of an energetic co-crystal to several molecular structural descriptors, which are calculated by Dragon software. It is indicated that the density of a co-crystal is a function of sp, OB, DU, n(AT), as well as several nonadditive structural parameters. The new recommended correlation was derived on the basis of the experimental densities of 50 co-crystals with various structures as a training set. The R-2 or determination coefficient of the derived correlation was 0.937. This correlation provided a suitable estimate for a further 12 energetic co-crystals as a test set. Meanwhile, the predictive ability of the correlation was investigated through a cross validation method. Moreover, the new model has more reliability and performance for predicting the densities of energetic co-crystals compared to a previous one which was based on an artificial neural network approach. As a matter of fact, designing novel energetic co-crystals is possible by utilising the proposed method.",2020
Signature of Energetic Materials Under Pyrolysis and Ambient Conditions,"Law enforcement and military personnel must be prepared to deal with explosives, unidentified chemicals, and even chemical warfare agents. This is a vast problem space. The included studies examine issues with characterization, mitigation, and disposal of energetic materials. Among oxidizers those containing the ammonium cation have the potential of self-oxidization, making them of special hazard. We have examined ammonium nitrite and ammonium chlorate, two ionic compounds with well-known hazard potential, and compare their explosive performance with related materials. A novel protocol for assessment of explosivity on the gram-scale was employed. Law enforcement and military personnel must deal with scenarios where fast and safe destruction of sensitive materials or chemical warfare agents (CWA) and biological threats is required. Any attempt to destroy these threats must ensure the method, itself, does not spread contamination. Flexible plasticized pyrotechnic formulations that burn with high heat release, but without detonation, have been created in order to allow controlled destruction. The pyrotechnics also provide a safe and fast method for destruction of sensitive information (laptops and documents). In the case of CWA, the pyrotechnic formulation must burn hot enough to melt through lightly cased containers, so that responders do not need to open them. In the cases of biological threats, the pyrotechnic can also release a biocide, e.g., a halogen, in addition to heat. In rating chemicals in terms of burn rate, heat release or explosive potential, the focus is usually on the anion since it is the species that carries the oxygen. However, in the final formulation the contribution of each species of the oxidizer and the fuel must be considered. After experimental testing on various polymers (ABS, PLA, PIB) and literature review, a flexible polymer with the appropriate properties was incorporated into an energetic mixture. Oxidizers were vetted for heat release using various forms of thermal analysis: SDT [Simultaneous Differential Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)]: and bomb (isoperibol) calorimetry. To achieve biocide generation, species containing releasable halogens were selected (e.g., calcium iodate and magnesium bromate), first by literature review, and then by testing selected materials for generation of molecular halogens. Several techniques were used for detection/quantification of the halogen, e.g., colorimetric test, UV/VIS, and Raman spectroscopy. The heat release of plasticized formulations was determined with SDT and bomb calorimetry, and the maximum temperature of an open burn was monitored with thermal camera. The viscoelastic behavior of the pure polymer and the plasticized formulation was determined with by rheometry. Long-term stability of explosives is a matter of concern to all who deal with them. Fluoropolymers have been used as the binder or plasticizer in a number of explosive formulations. Historically, munitions and energetic materials have been destroyed by open burn and open detonation (OB/OD). However, concerns have arisen on the effects of these plastics on the environment and on human health and development. These indestructible plastics and their byproducts have been found in air, food sources and the human body. The thermal decomposition of explosive formulations containing such plastics has been examined using SDT; TGA-IR (Thermogravimetric Analysis -Infrared Spectroscopy) and Pyrolysis GC-MS (Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry). The explosives and polymers were examined independently and mixed (50% HMX- 50%polymer and 95% HMX and 5% polymer, by weight). An actual sample of PBXN-5 (95% HMX and 5% Viton A) was also studied.",2023
2D-WO,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a hot research topic owing to their excellent topological and chemical properties. Graphene, the most popular 2D material, has been employed in energetic materials (EM) and it exhibits excellent energetic performance, such as catalyzing combustion and decomposition of ammonium perchlorate, desensitizing HMX and CL20 owing to its large specific surface area (excellent for absorption and intimacy with other components), and electrical and thermal conductivity (facilitating electrostatic and thermal dissipation, and thus desensitization). However, thus far, utilizing metal oxide-based 2D materials in the field of EM has been extremely rare, particularly 2D-WO3. 2D-WO3/nano-Al (nAl) nanoenergetic materials (2DnEMs) are reported in this study, for the first time, with the aim of using the large specific surface area and surface defects of 2D materials to improve the intimacy and reactivity between energetic components. In this study, a 2D material (2D-WO3) was prepared and characterized, and 2DnEMs were obtained by ultrasonically mixing 2D-WO3 with nAl powders. The slow heating behavior and combustion properties of 2DnEM were investigated. It was observed that 2DnEM exhibits more reaction heat (1415.9 vs 1209.0 J/g) during the solid-phase reaction, significantly lower initiating temperature (262 vs 451 degrees C), two orders of magnitude smaller ignition delay (similar to 0.006 vs similar to 0.4 s), and significantly better combustion performance (22.1 vs 8.4 MPa in peak combustion pressure; 24.2 vs 1.2 GPa/s in pressurization) than the regular nano-WO3/ nAl mixture. The results demonstrate that 2D metal oxides can significantly improve the reactivity and performance of EMs.",2022
Modeling the thermo-mechanical structure of energetic material flames,"The small-scale flame structure of combusting homogeneous energetic material is investigated with focus on the thermal expansion, variable thermal properties in the condensed phase, and effects introduced by small curvature of the burning surface. A nonlinear heat equation is derived for a burning thermo-elastic solid with temperature-dependent specific heat, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity coefficients. It is solved for different modeling approximations both analytically and numerically. Explicit expressions are obtained for the regression rate of the burning surface as functions of surface temperature and thermal expansion parameters. A simple one-step reaction model of the gas phase is used to study the full structure of the flame front and illuminate the influence of temperature-dependent material properties on the regression rate, surface temperature, and flame stand-off distance. The small curvature limit is studied to determine curvature effects on deflagration of a curved surface of a homogeneous energetic material. Under the assumption of quasi-steady deflagration, a method of matched asymptotics is employed to derive first-order curvature corrections to the burning rate and surface temperature. The problem of a spherical particle deflagration is solved, both by asymptotics and by numerics, under the assumption of solid phase-controlled burning. A numerical method is derived, as a result of extensive study and testing of various surface-tracking algorithms, to simulate combustion of energetic material in a fully coupled formulation with high activation energy in the solid phase for linear and spherically symmetric cases. This method is used to verify the assumption of quasi-steadiness of the energetic material deflagration. The problem of efficiently computing the stable burn-back of a solid rocket motor when the motor is in the quasi-steady burning regime of operation is considered. Through the use of a straightforward two-timing multi-scale asymptotic analysis, the reduced description of the quasi-steady burning regime for a model problem is developed that is extensible to a full three-dimensional rocket. Advanced time-integration strategies developed for the airspace industry are adopted to the solid rocket motor grain burning to compute a series of realizations of steady flows as the grain burns back to near completion.",2005
Energetic Polymers: A Chance for Lightweight Reactive Structure Materials?,"Today's ammunition still consists of about 70 wt% structure-providing materials such as metals providing no energetic contribution. Therefore, reactive structure materials (RSMs) offer tremendous room for improvement. While current research focuses on rather heavy, metal-based materials (e. g., alloys, thermites), energetic polymers appear as an under-recognized opportunity for very lightweight RSMs. Unfortunately, suitable polymers are unavailable as energetic polymer research has almost exclusively focused on elastic binders with the least possible glass transition temperature. An application as RSM, however, requires rigid polymers with a glass transition above operational temperatures. Accordingly, monomers with fundamentally different structures are required. The first step in this particular direction is 3-(2,4,6-trinitrophenoxy)oxetane (TNPO). Herein, we report the synthesis of its homopolymer and investigate its polymerization behavior by copolymerization with prior art energetic oxetanes. All polymers were intensively studied by vibrational and multinuclear (H-1, C-13, N-14) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Hereby, DSC revealed the high effect of the TNPO repeating unit on the glass transition temperature. The performance of all polymers was calculated using the EXPLO5 code to evaluate the potential performance range of polymeric RSMs. Further, their shock and friction sensitivity was determined by BAM standard procedures.",2022
Bridged bisnitramide-substituted furazan-based energetic materials,"A series of bridged bisnitramide energetic compounds was designed and synthesized based on amino/nitro-functionalized furazans with methyl-NNO-azoxy, 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 3-hydrazino(imino)methyl side-chain groups. For comparison, 4-(methyl-azoxy)-3-nitraminofurazan as a direct nitration product and the corresponding ammonium salt were also prepared. All new compounds were thoroughly characterized by IR, NMR, elemental analyses, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Two of them were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Heats of formation and detonation properties were calculated by using Gaussian 03 and EXPLO 5 programs, respectively. Energetic evaluation indicates that these compounds have potential to compete with the traditional explosive TNT and in some cases approach high explosive PETN. In addition, these results show that the combination of alkyl-bridging moiety and furazan ring expand the options for the design of new energetic materials with varying sensitivities.",2016
Compatibility study of erythritol tetranitrate with some energetic materials,"The compatibility of erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) with RDX, CL-20, PETN, TNT, HMX, Picric acid was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Two methods for judging the compatibility level of ETN and conventional explosives are introduced. One method is using the decomposition temperature (T-p) and apparent activation energy (E-o) of the thermal decomposition curve at the heating rate, the compatibility levels of the two explosives can be obtained. The results show that ETN with RDX have good compatibility, level 1; ETN with HMX, CL-20 are fair compatibility, level 2; ETN with PETN, TNT and Picric acid are poor compatibility, level 3. Another method is when apparent activation energy (E-o) is not added, the compatibility levels are different when just used the decomposition temperature (T-p).",2023
Economy-wide rebound effects for non-energetic raw materials,"Material efficiency is increasingly being seen as a means to save resources and achieve greater security of supply. Whether these aims can be achieved to the desired extent depends, among other things, on the presence of rebound effects. This article estimates economy-wide rebound effects for non-energetic raw materials in the context of a set of material efficiency projects carried out in Germany. Under the assumption that the efficiency technologies developed in these projects are scaled up to the national level, input-output analysis is used to calculate changed material requirements and corresponding rebound effects. Reduced material flows in monetary terms, together with economic data, are aggregated to an economy-wide impulse, which can cause re-increases in the demand for the considered raw materials. Depending on the project-specific framework conditions and subject to the modeling assumptions, our estimates suggest that individual materials display a wide range of rebound effects, ranging from close to zero to low double digit percentages. These results point towards the conclusion that economy-wide rebound effects do not make these efficiency measures obsolete. However, they also suggest that rebound effects should not be ignored in the assessment of the role of efficiency in future resource consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
On the Release of Stored Energy from Energetic Materials,"Grinding, shocking, rapidly crushing, or electrically stimulating organic solids generates a variety of excited electronic state species including atoms, ions, radicals, fragments, etc., that are reactive on an ultrafast (<100 fs) timescale. In this review, we present the nonadiabatic theory that describes such species kinetics and dynamics that initiate, drive, and sustain the decomposition of energetic materials. The quantum mechanical theory that models this behavior is discussed in detail with regard to the excitation of energetic and nonenergetic model systems. The multireference approach taken can distinguish similar energetic and nonenergetic molecules with respect to their decomposition behavior and generation of an initial product fragment. The theory described involves complete active space self-consistent field calculations of adiabatic potential energy surfaces that interact nonadiabatically at conical intersections (Os). The CIs are thereby responsible for the ultrafast kinetics and dynamics that generate the initial fragmentation behavior of both energetic and nonenergetic molecules. This energy release mechanism has two important consequences for the decomposition of the Molecular species of interest: (1) the molecule is excited to higher electronic states and thereby has of the order of at least 5 eV of energy to break bonds; and (2) through various CIs the energetic molecule can return to the ground electronic state (in <100 fs) at a very different part of its ground state potential energy surface so that unexpected new reactive radicals can be generated. We demonstrate such behavior for energetic and nonenergetic nitramines, furazans, tetrazines, imidazoles, and other energetic systems. Our approach readily distinguishes energetic from nonenergetic molecular behavior both theoretically and experimentally.",2014
Investigating the Ability to Preheat and Ignite Energetic Materials Using Electrically Conductive Materials,"The work discussed in this document seeks to integrate conductive additives with energetic material systems to offer an alternative source of ignition for the energetic material. By utilizing the conductive properties of the additives, ohmic heating may serve as a method for preheating and igniting an energetic material. This would allow for controlled ignition of the energetic material without the use of a traditional ignition source, and could also result in easier system fabrication. For ohmic heating to be a viable method of preheating or igniting these conductive energetic materials, there cannot be significant impact on the energetic properties of the energetic materials. Various mass solids loadings of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were mixed with a reactive mixture of aluminum (Al)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to test if ohmic heating ignition was feasible and to inspect the impact that these loadings had on the energetic properties of the Al/PVDF. Results showed that while ohmic heating was a plausible method for igniting the conductive energetic samples, the addition of GNPs degraded the energetic properties of the Al/PVDF. The severity of this degradation was minimized at lower solids loadings of GNPs, but this consequently resulted in larger voltage input requirements to ignite the conductive energetic material. This was attributable to the decreased conductivities of the samples at lower solids loading of GNPs. In hopes of conserving the energetic properties of the Al/PVDF while integrating the conductive additives, additive manufacturing techniques, more specifically fused filament fabrication, was used to print two distinct materials, Al/PVDF and a conductive composite, into singular parts. A CraftBot 3 was used to selectively deposit Conductive Graphene PLA (Black Magic) filament with a reactive filament comprised of a PVDF binder with 20% mass solids loadings of aluminum. Various amounts of voltage were applied to these conductive energetic samples to quantify the time to ignition of the Al/PVDF as the applied voltage increased. A negative correlation was discovered between the applied voltage and time to ignition. This result was imperative for demonstrating that the reaction rate could be influenced with the application of higher applied voltages. Fused filament fabrication was also used to demonstrate the scalability of the dual printed conductive energetic materials. A flexural test specimen made of the Al/PVDF was printed with an embedded strain gauge made of the Black Magic filament. This printed strain gauge was tested for dual purposes: as an igniter and as a strain sensor, demonstrating the multi-functional use of integrating conductive additives with energetic materials. In all, the experiments in this document lay a foundation for utilizing conductive additives with energetic materials to offer an alternative form of ignition. Going forward, ohmic heating ignition may serve as a replacement to current, outdated methods of ignition for heat sensitive energetic materials.",2020
Theoretical design of nitrogen-rich cages for energetic materials,"Nitrogen-rich ring CxNy molecules, new types of potential energetic molecules, were investigated in the computational study reported here. The energetic properties, detonation performance, and stability of four CxNy cages designed based on the most stable N(12 )cage were researched comparison with hexaazaisowurtzitane and cubane. Calculations were carried out with density functional theory and Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) using the basis sets 6-31+G(d,p) and cc-pvdz. The stabilities were explored in two ways: (1) the relative stability of one to another based on their own structural features; (2) the thermal stabilities determined by calculating the corresponding bond-breaking energies. Their comparable performance with hexaazaisowurtzitane and cubane highlights the potential applications of these cages as energetic materials and also supports that replacement of nitrogen atoms in all-nitrogen molecules with carbon atom or by oxygen atoms is a good strategy.",2022
Molecular-Shape-Dominated Crystal Packing Features of Energetic Materials,"Molecular shape is observed to greatly determine the properties of energetic materials (EMs); that is, the spherical molecules generally have high energy while the planar molecules have low sensitivity in common. Nevertheless, how the molecular shapes along with their packing modes affect the crystal packing features, such as crystal density and packing coefficient (PC), that are crucial factors describing the energy and sensitivity properties of EMs, is still unclear. Herein, this issue was addressed via a statistical analysis of more than 10(3) available energetic crystals. Despite crystal density having an overall increasing trend with PC, high crystal density and high PC are dominated by spherical and planar molecules, respectively. Intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds are important factors that affect molecular shapes and packing features of EMs, respectively. Hopefully, the results reported here can deepen the understanding of the structure-property relationship to rationally design novel EMs with outstanding properties. Moreover, the present study provides a route to quantitatively identify the molecular shapes and packing modes based on simple structural parameters, which can be further applied to the detailed identification and analysis of energetic crystals with specific packing modes.",2021
Processing and Characterization of Carbon Nanotube Enhanced Energetic Materials,"Future generations of aircraft design will increasingly make use of internal carriages to help enhance the stealth capabilities of the aircraft by reducing radar cross-section and drag. This places an increased focus on designing munitions and energetic materials to fit advancing needs of high energy density and low sensitivity. Polymer bonded explosives (PBX) notably suffer from high levels of sensitivity to accidental detonation induced by the presence of a thermomechanical insult. Current strategies for desensitizing of PBX come at the expense of a significant reduction in performance. A possible method for desensitizing PBX without adverse performance effects is multifunctional tailoring of the mechanical properties through the strategic incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes directly into the binder phase. The addition of the CNTs should provide an increased level of viscoelastic dissipation and load transferring to shield the crystals from the effects of a thermomechanical force, while also increasing the thermal conductivity to provide increased pathways for heat conduction away from induced hot spots prior to detonation. In this work, a fabrication method was put together to produce consistent polymer bonded simulants (PBS), followed by characterization of their microstructure, and experimental testing to determine the effects of CNT concentration. Thermal testing showed the thermal conductivity of the PBS increased with increasing CNT concentration. Low strain rate compression testing showed evidence of a CNT induced structural skeleton effect that provides the binder with an increased interfacial adherence, load transfer, and an ability to absorb higher levels of deformation. These efforts show the potential of CNT enhanced energetic materials.",2018
RHEOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS BY ROTATIONAL TESTING TECHNIQUES,"In production of energetic materials, the rheological behavior of propellant doughs is a key factor to identify optimum and safe conditions for processing these special compounds. The analysis of their rheological properties during mixing and extrusion stages is needed to clarify the complex interrelations between the different process parameters and the expected performance of these products, providing essential information for the possible increase of system productivity and overall product quality. In this study, the rheological analysis of triple-base propellants and a propellant simulant was carried out by a DHR-2 rotational rheometer of TA Instruments. Furthermore, different testing techniques were evaluated for appropriate characterization of these propellants. According to the results of rheological measurements, these triple-base propellants were found to correspond to shear-thinning materials (pseudo-plastic behavior). Finally, the results obtained from these experimental observations were matched to well-known constitutive empirical models to describe the mathematical relation between viscosity and shear strain rate.",2014
Investigation on detonation properties of bridged furazan energetic materials,"A series of -N-N/N--N- bridged furazan energetic materials were designed. Physicochemical properties of the designed compounds were calculated based on the structures which were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) method at B3LYP/6-311G (d, p) level. The results indicate that the solid-phase heats of formation of the designed compounds were high which range from 1066.3 kJ mol-1(compound D4) to 2476.5 kJ mol-1 (compound C5). The -N3 energetic was the most effective group to improve the heat of formation of the designed compounds while energetic group -C(NO2)3 was the most effective unit to increases the density, heat of detonation, detonation velocity and detonation pressure. Finally, compounds C1, C2, C7 and F1 were screened as candidates of high energy density materials based on calculated detonation properties and sensitivities.",2023
Dielectric constant predictions for energetic materials using quantum calculations,"The dielectric constant (DC) is one of the key properties for detection of threat materials such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). In the present paper, the density functional theory (DFT) as well as ab-initio approaches are used to explore effective methods to predict dielectric constants of a series of 12 energetic materials (EMs) for which experimental data needed to experimentally determine the dielectric constant (refractive indices) are available. These include military grades energetic materials, nitro and peroxide compounds, and the widely used nitroglycerin. Ab-initio and DFT calculations are conducted. In order to calculate dielectric constant values of materials, potential DFT functional combined with basis sets are considered for testing. Accuracy of the calculations are compared to experimental data listed in the scientific literature, and time required for calculations are both evaluated and discussed. The best functional/basis set combinations among those tested are CAM-B3LYP and AUG-ccpVDZm, which provide great results, with accuracy deviations below 5% when calculated results are compared to experimental data.

Energetic Material/Polymer Interaction Studied by Atomic Force Microscopy,"The interactions of energetic materials and polymers have important implications in safety, long-term storage, and performance of explosives and explosive mixtures. Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate adhesion forces at the molecular scale of nine energetic materials, organic explosives and energetic salts, on eleven common polymers (polyethylene, polyvinylalcohol, poly(vinyl chloride), polycarbonate, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), styrene-butadiene rubber, poly(4-vinyl phenol), poly(2,6-dimethylphenylene oxide), poly(2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide) (Tenax (R)), and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon (R))). Teflon was the least adhesive polymer to all energetic materials, while no distinct trend could be elucidated among the other polymers or energetic materials.",2016
Modeling of high energy laser ignition of energetic materials,"We present a model for simulating high energy laser heating and ignition of confined energetic materials. The model considers the effect of irradiating a steel plate with long laser pulses and continuous lasers of several kilowatts and the thermal response of well-characterized high explosives for ignition. Since there is enough time for the thermal wave to propagate into the target and to create a region of hot spot in the high explosives, electron thermal diffusion of ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) lasing is ignored; instead, heat diffusion of absorbed laser energy in the solid target is modeled with thermal decomposition kinetic models of high explosives. Numerically simulated pulsed-laser heating of solid target and thermal explosion of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, triaminotrinitrobenzene, and octahydrotetranitrotetrazine are compared to experimental results. The experimental and numerical results are in good agreement. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.",2008
Metal-Free Molecular Perovskite High-Energetic Materials,"Metal-free energetic materials generally have the advantages of high gas yield and metal-free residue after combustion or explosion, enabling them to be widely used as explosives and propellant components. As part of a series of our investigations on ABX(3) molecular perovskite high-energetic materials, here we report five new metal-free members, (H(2)A)[NH4(ClO4)(3)], by using different organic cations H(2)A(2+), i.e., 1-hydroxy-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium for DAP-O4, piperazine-1,4-diium for PAP-4, 1-methyl-piperazine-1,4-diium for PAP-M4, homopiperazine-1,4-diium for PAP-H4, and 1-methyl-1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium for DAP-M4, respectively. Together with the previously reported member, (H(2)dabco)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] (DAP-4, H(2)dabco(2+) = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium), these six metal-free molecular perovskite high-energetic materials provide nice instances to fine-tune the oxygen balance, crystal density, thermal stability, and detonation performance, by changing the A-site organic cations solely. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the Kamlet-Jacob (K-J) equation suggested that improving the oxygen balance while keeping the spherical shape of the organic cations to match the anionic cage in these metal-free energetic materials facilitates obtaining a better detonation performance, providing an important clue for designing advanced practicable high-energetic materials. It is worth noting that three compounds (PAP-4, PAP-H4, and DAP-04) are expected to exceed the performances of RDX as both explosive and propellant, in which DAP-O4 has the highest detonation heat (6.21 kJ mol(-1), detonation velocity (8.900 km s(-1)), and detonation pressure (35.7 GPa), as well as a higher specific impulse value (262 s).",2020
Stable isotope profiling of energetic materials and their precursors,"The research described in this thesis is intended to contribute to the development and application of isotope ratio mass spectrometry as an analytical technique which can provide additional sample information in forensic investigations. The field of explosives investigations is the primary focus of this research, although the interpretation of results draws on information from a variety of scientific areas such as environmental studies of water and nitrates. Application of any analytical technique in forensic fields of endeavour demands high quality results and hence, the method development, validation and accreditation are described in the opening chapter of this thesis. Comparisons of isotope analysis results for energetic samples and their precursors using multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis, distinguishes samples known to be different and groups those known to share similarities. In this study samples of the explosives; black powder, C4, TNT, Semetex, RDX and HMTD were analysed. Samples of ammonium nitrate hexamine and hydrogen peroxide were analysed as potential precursors to energetic materials. The thesis concludes by establishing isotopic links between precursors and products, potentially providing additional evidence of manufacture of energetic materials.",2010
Anisotropic constitutive relationships in energetic materials: Nitromethane and RDX,"The anisotropic constitutive relationships in solid nitromethane (NM) and alpha-RDX were studied using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). In addition to hydrostatic compressions, we performed uniaxial compressions in the [100], [010], [001], [110], [101], [011], and [111] directions up to the compression ratio V/V-0 = 0.70. Equilibrium properties, including lattice parameters and elastic constants, as well as hydrostatic EOS, are in good agreement with available experimental data. The shear stresses of uniaxially compressed NM and alpha-RDX were used to predict the relative shock sensitivity between different crystallographic directions.",2007
Thermal Analysis of a New Heat-Resistant Energetic Material,"4,4'-Dichloro-2,2',3,3',5,5',6,6'-octanitroazobenzene (DCONAB) is a kind of new heat-resistant energetic material. In the paper, its thermal decomposition kinetics was investigated by means of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The properties of the DCONAB, such as geometry, theoretical density, enthalpy of formation, detonation parameters, were studied by using the density universal culvert theory at the B3LYP/6-31+G (d, p) level. The results indicated that the density distribution of the DCONAB was up to 1.99 g/cm(3) and its detonation rate was close to 8851 m/s. We obtained thermal analysis curves of the DCONAB at different heating rates and we analyzed the kinetic parameters such as activation energy (E-a) and exponential factor (A) with Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods. Meanwhile, we investigated the decomposition mechanism of the DCONAB with the Satava-Sestak method. The results indicated that the thermal decomposition mechanism of the DCONAB related to nucleation and growth, with the reaction order n being 1. The integral form of the kinetic function was g(alpha) = alpha. The activation energy was 131 kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor 1.375 x 10(12) min(-1).",2022
Thermochemistry and Initial Decomposition Pathways of Triazole Energetic Materials,"A thorough investigation of the initial decomposition pathways of triazoles and their nitro-substituted derivatives has been conducted using the MP2 method for optimization and DLPNO-CCSD(T) method for energy. Different Mow initial thermolysis mechanisms are proposed for 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,3-triazole, the two kinds of triazoles. The higher energy barrier of the primary decomposition path of 1,2,4-triazole (H-transfer path, similar to 52 kcal/mol) compared with that of 1,2,3-triazole (ring-open path, similar to 45 kcal/mol) shows that 1,2,4-triazole is more stable, consistent with experimental observations. For nitro-substituted triazoles, more dissociation channels associated with the nitro group have been obtained and found to be competitive with the primary decomposition paths of the triazole skeleton in some cases. Besides, the effect of the nitro group on the decomposition pattern of the triazole skeleton has been explored, and it has been found that the electron-withdrawing nitro group has an opposite effect on the primary dissociation channels of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives and 1,2,3-triazole derivatives.",2020
Kinetic Stability and Propellant Performance of Green Energetic Materials,"A thorough theoretical investigation of four promising green energetic materials is presented. The kinetic stability of the dinitramide, trinitrogen dioxide, pentazole, and oxopentazole anions has been evaluated in the gas phase and in solution by using high-level ab initio and DFT calculations. Theoretical UV spectra, solid-state heats of formation, density, as well as propellant performance for the corresponding ammonium salts are reported. All calculated properties for dinitramide are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The stability of the trinitrogen dioxide anion is deemed sufficient to enable synthesis at low temperature, with a barrier for decomposition of approximately 27.5 kcal mol(-1) in solution. Oxopentazolate is expected to be approximately 1200 times more stable than pentazolate in solution, with a barrier exceeding 30 kcal mol(-1), which should enable handling at room temperature. All compounds are predicted to provide high specific impulses when combined with aluminum fuel and a polymeric binder, and rival or surpass the performance of a corresponding ammonium perchlorate based propellant. The investigated substances are also excellent monopropellant candidates. Further study and attempted synthesis of these materials is merited.",2010
Thermal characterization of the promising energetic material TKX-50,"The thermal behavior of dihydroxylammonium 5,50-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and thermal gravimetric analysisdifferential scanning calorimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-MS). The critical temperature of thermal explosion (T-b) and the initial decomposition temperature (T-p0) were determined to be 523.39 and 513.80 K, respectively. The apparent activation energy (E) and preexponential factor (A) of the exothermic decomposition reaction, and activation entropy (Delta S-not equal), activation enthalpy (Delta H-not equal), activation Gibbs free energy (Delta G(not equal)) at T-P0 of the reaction and the critical temperature of thermal explosion (T-b) were calculated: E-K = 237.59 kJ mol(-1), E-O = 234.11 kJ mol(-1), Delta S-not equal = 209.83 J K-1 mol(-1), Delta H-not equal = 233.32 kJ mol(-1), Delta G(not equal) = 126.53 kJ mol(-1). TG-DSC-FTIR/MS analysis of thermal decomposition products of TKX-50 reveals that the main decomposition products are N-2, H2O, NH3, NH2, N2O and NO.",2015
Treatment of energetic material contaminated wastewater using ionic liquids,"The contamination of energetic materials (EMs) in wastewater during its production and application is one of the serious environmental issues. Selected hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) were developed, characterized and applied for the separation of EMs such as TNT, tetryl and picric acid from aqueous medium. Batch-wise extraction experiments were performed at 700 rpm in a capped glass vial at 25 degrees C. The IL containing anion, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide ([NTf2](-)) played a vital role in the separation of EMs due to its large ionic radius. It was, therefore, extensively used for the optimization of various process parameters. The investigation of the extraction mechanism has revealed that a C-H center dot center dot center dot Pi interaction is present between the IL and EM. The results show the highest distribution ratio of 2095 for the tetryl amongst the other EMs used. A maximum separation factor for tetryl/TNT, TNT/picric acid and picric acid/tetryl was observed to be 1.75, 6.65 and 0.15, respectively for the IL, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis [trifluoromethanesulfonyl] imide ([OMIM][NTf2]). After the extraction, the IL was separated from the aqueous phase and repeatedly treated five times with a fresh batch of EM.",2015
Impact of Energetic Materials on Properties of Infrared Illuminants,"For energetic materials as flammable agents or additive agents effecting on properties of infrared illuminants is studied. The experimental results indicate that compared with containing ATZ, the properties of the infrared illuminant containing AGNTO are better, whose rate of infrared radiation and output visible light increases 83.57% or 39.63%,respectively; at the same time, the burning rate reduces 5.23% and the cover index is 0.122. In all of five additive energetic materials, Nitrocellulose, black powder, RDX, HMX and PETN, HMX is the best because it can make the output of IR increase 3.04% and decrease 2.76% to the output of visible light, the intensity of infrared radiation of per quality increase 2.26% while the intensity of visible light is decreased 3.62% compared with the basic composition, and the convert index 0.164 of the infrared illuminant containing HMX with a suitable burning rate is the highest of all. RDX is the most effective on the increasing of the infrared radiation; the rate can reach 8.26%. PETN can make the intensity of infrared radiation of per quality increase 11.74%, and its burning rate 2.57mm/s is the lowest.",2011
Experimental flame speed in multi-layered nano-energetic materials,"This paper deals with the reaction of dense Metastable Intermolecular Composite (MIC) materials, which have a higher density than conventional energetic materials. The reaction of a multilayer thin film of aluminum and copper oxide has been studied by varying the Substrate material and thicknesses. The inplane speed of propagation of the reaction was experimentally determined using a time of-flight technique. The experiment shows that the reaction is completely quenched for a silicon substrate having an intervening silica layer of less than 200 nm. The speed of reaction seems to be constant at 40 m/s for silica layers with a thickness greater than 1 pm. Different substrate materials such as glass and photoresist were also used.

Investigation of select energetic materials by differential reflection spectrometry,"The presence of explosive or energetic materials is prevalent in today’s world. Terrorists continue to target buildings and mass transit systems with explosive devices. The detection of these energetic materials is necessary to insure national security and welfare. Detection techniques such as X-ray scanners, Raman spectroscopy, Terahertz spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry are in current use or development; however, none of these are appropriate for all necessary applications. These techniques include. The present document provides an overview of the current detection techniques and describes a new technique for detecting energetic materials called differential reflection spectrometry (DRS). DRS essentially measures the optical absorption of energetic materials. The use of DRS has led to the discovery of previously unreported optical characteristics for some energetic compounds that are unique to the individual material. These optical characteristics consist of absorption shoulders between 270 and 420 nm, e.g. near 420 nm for 2, 4, 6 trinitrotoluene (TNT). In the presented research, the origin of the differential reflection spectra obtained was investigated using several techniques including UV-Visible spectrophotometry (transmission and reflection) and computer molecular modeling. Experimental DRS spectra of TNT, hexahydro-1,3,5 trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX), octahydro 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,6 tetrazocine (HMX), 18 pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and 2, 4, 6, n-tetranitro-n-methylaniline (Tetryl) were taken and analyzed. From the experimental results and verification by molecular modeling, it was found that the absorption features observed in the redder region of the UV range (270–420 nm) are due to molecular orbital transitions in the nitro (NO 2 ) groups of the measured explosives. These transitions only occur in specific conditions, such as high concentration solutions and solids, where the normally forbidden transitions are allowed. The unique optical characteristics of the energetic materials presented in this dissertation are observed only in the solid or relatively high concentrated states suggesting the interaction of several molecules. Therefore these absorption features are proposed to be due to a charge transfer self-complex. This phenomenon can be interpreted in the same manner as the accumulation of atoms and be modeled using quantum mechanics.",2007
Critical shock wave initiation pressure of typical energetic materials,"To explore the shock wave initiation capacity of typical energetic materials, an improved gap test is used to study the critical shock wave initiation pressure of three typical energetic materials, including RDX-based mixed explosives, HMX-based mixed explosives, and RDX/AP/Al-based mixed explosives. The equivalent contrast of the critical initiation capacity of typical energetic materials with TNT is conducted. The results show that the equivalent ratios of the critical initiation pressure of TNT for RDX-based and HMX-based mixed explosives are less than 1, which means that their shock wave sensitivity and initiation capacity are higher than TNT. However, the shock wave initiation capacity of RDX/AP/Al-based propellant mixed explosive is not up to that of TNT. In addition, to further clarify the dynamic change of the shock initiation process, the shock wave initiation of the RDX-based mixture is selected to perform a numerical simulation. The results show that when the pressure is greater than the critical pressure, a detonation growth process to achieve complete detonation is experienced after the shock wave passes through the gaps and enters the explosive. Therefore, the research results can provide basic data for the critical shock wave initiation capacity of energetic materials.",2022
Multiscale multiphase modeling of detonations in condensed energetic materials,"Hot spots ignition and shock to detonation transition modeling in pressed explosives is addressed in the frame of multiphase flow theory. Shock propagation results in mechanical disequilibrium effects between the condensed phase and the gas trapped in pores. Resulting subscale motion creates hot spots at pore scales. Pore collapse is modeled as a pressure relaxation process, during which dissipated power by the 'configuration' pressure produces local heating. Such an approach reduces 3D micromechanics and sub scale contacts effects to a 'granular' equation of state. Hot spots criticity then results of the competition between heat deposition and conductive losses. Heat losses between the hot solid-gas interface at pore's scale and the colder solid core grains are determined through a subgrid model using two energy equations for the solid phase. The conventional energy balance equation provides the volume average solid temperature and a non-conventional energy equation provides the solid core temperature that accounts for shock heating. With the help of these two temperatures and subscale reconstruction, the interface temperature is determined as well as interfacial heat loss. The overall flow model thus combines a full disequilibrium two-phase model for the mean solid-gas flow variables with a subgrid model, aimed to compute local solid-gas interface temperature. Its evolution results of both subscale motion dissipation and conductive heat loss. The interface temperature serves as ignition criterion for the solid material deflagration. There is no subscale mesh, no system of partial differential equations solved at grain scale. The resulting model contains less parameter than existing ones and associates physical meaning to each of them. It is validated against experiments in two very different regimes: Shock to detonation transition, that typically happens in pressure ranges of 50 kbar and shock propagation that involves pressure ranges 10 times higher.

Probabilistic and energetic scaling of fracture of quasibrittle materials,"Engineering structures that consist of brittle heterogeneous, or quasibrittle, materials such as concrete, fiber composites, ceramics, rocks, etc., exhibit a size-dependent failure behavior due to the fact that the size of fracture process zone (FPZ) is not negligible compared to structure size. This dissertation deals with both the probabilistic and energetic size effects caused by finiteness of FPZ of these materials. The first part of this dissertation focuses on the size effects on the strength and lifetime statistics of quasibrittle structures failing at the initiation of a macrocrack from one representative volume element (RVE). This class of structures can be statistically modeled as a chain of RVEs, and the cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) of structural strength and lifetime are related to the strength and lifetime cdf's of one RVE. The strength distribution of one RVE is derived from atomistic fracture mechanics and multiscale statistical analysis. The lifetime distribution of one RVE under constant load is related to the strength distribution through the kinetics of subcritical crack growth. The power law for creep crack growth, previously considered empirical, is physically justified by atomistic fracture mechanics with certain plausible hypotheses about multiscale bridging. This theory indicates marked size effects on the types of cdf's of strength and lifetime, as well as on the mean structural strength and lifetime. The framework of this theory is also applied to the lifetime statistics of high– k gate dielectrics, based on a mathematical analogy between the failure of quasibrittle structures and the breakdown of gate dielectrics. The second part of this dissertation, which investigates the size effect from a different viewpoint, deals with the energetic (nonstatistical) scaling of strength of metal-composite hybrid joints, which are a critical component of modern designs for large ships and aircraft. The strength of the joint is determined by the energy criterion for the macrocrack initiation at the bimaterial corner, from which the large-size asymptote of the size effect law is obtained. A general approximate size effect law, spanning all sizes, is further derived via asymptotic matching. The proposed size effect law is verified by size effect tests on geometrically similar specimens.",2010
Defect evolution and pore collapse in crystalline energetic materials,"This work examines the use of crystal based continuum mechanics in the context of dynamic loading. In particular, we examine model forms and simulations which are relevant to pore collapse in crystalline energetic materials. Strain localization and the associated generation of heat are important for the initiation of chemical reactions in this context. The crystal mechanics based model serves as a convenient testbed for the interactions among wave motion, slip kinetics, defect generation kinetics and physical length scale. After calibration to available molecular dynamics and single crystal gas gun data for HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), the model is used to predict behaviors for the collapse of pores under various conditions. Implications for experimental observations are discussed.",2009
Investigation of thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene: An energetic material,"Oxidation and pyrolysis mechanisms of energetic materials shape their macro properties such as autoigni-tion and detonation. The high reaction-enthalpy, microsecond order reaction time, and toxicity necessitate investigation of their detailed chemical kinetics. A shock tube combined with laser absorption diagnos-tic provides time-resolved, high-sensitivity, and homogeneous environment to study thermal degrada-tion of energetic and hazardous materials. In this work, we investigated the thermal fragmentation of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2), a prototypical energetic material and nitro-aromatic representative, behind re-flected shock waves. We studied its pyrolysis and decomposition branching channels over temperatures of 1155-1434 K and pressures of 0.82-1.78 bar. Channel-specific branching ratio was determined by em-ploying a two-color laser absorption diagnostic. Two decomposition pathways are found to be significant under our experimental conditions. The first channel ( k 1 ) produces phenyl radical (C6H5) and NO2 while the second channel ( k 2 ) generates phenoxy radical (C6H5O) and NO. We monitored the reaction progress by tracing channel-specific products, i.e., phenyl radical (C6H5) and NO, using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and infrared (IR) absorption diagnostics. UV-vis light at 445 nm for phenyl radical detection came from the frequency doubling of 890 nm light, generated by a titanium-sapphire laser, which was pumped by a green (532 nm) Nd:YAG laser. IR light at 5.517 mu m for NO detection was generated by an external-cavity quantum cascade laser. We extracted the rate coefficients of the two decomposition channels and fitted them in Arrhenius form (units of s-1): k 1 = 8 . 49 x 10 14 exp ( -30476 TK ) k 2 = 2 . 31 x 10 13 exp (-27618 TK ) Rate coefficients of both channels show positive temperature dependence while we did not observe discernible pressure dependence over 0.82-1.78 bar. Our measurements agree with a previous theoret-ical work qualitatively that, under these high-temperature conditions, the decomposition channel pro-ducing phenyl radicals and NO2 ( k 1 ) prevails over the NO-producing channel. Quantitatively, however, the theoretical work overestimates the importance of k 1 channel, particularly at low temperatures. Our rate of production analysis shows that most of the phenyl radicals are consumed through their self -recombination while N atoms are mainly converted to NO2. This work benefits high-fidelity chemical modeling of the relevant safety and ignition aspects of nitrogen-containing energetic/hazardous materi-als.(c) 2023 The Combustion Institute.

Toward a machine-guided approach to energetic material discovery,"In this article, we trained a machine learning (ML) model to connect microstructural details of an energetic material formulation to its performance for the purpose of guiding the discovery of new explosive formulations. Our hypothesis was that the algorithm would robustly learn the training data and produce an accurate surrogate model. Specifically, the algorithm learned the relationship between details of the void size distribution (VSD), initiating shock pressure, and the energetic material performance. We used realistic constraints on the VSD and a range of cases were ingested by a physically informed reactive flow model working within a hydrodynamic solver running on high-performance computing resources. The ML algorithm produced a surrogate model that accurately predicted known test points around the parameter space. In addition to the utility of the model and the process used for its development, we noted interesting comparisons between what we, the authors-subject matter experts, would heuristically conclude from the training data and the surrogate model predictions. We detected nuanced details that were missed by the surrogate model; however, these details are not important to an energetic material formulator. We concluded that the algorithm did indeed robustly learn the training data and produce an accurate surrogate model. We further concluded that the surrogate model is a powerful tool to guide the formulator in the absence of subject matter experts and limited-access computing resources.

Microwave Enhancement and Control of Solid-State Energetic Materials,"Microwave irradiation offers a unique way to enhance and control the combustion of energetic materials. However, one must understand the governing mechanisms and material properties involved to effectively utilize this technology and find efficient targets for microwave coupling. This dissertation focuses on summarizing the current state of the art in microwave-energetic interactions and the application of these principles for the enhancement and control of various solid-state energetics. It begins with a review of fundamentals for microwave interactions with energetic materials and factors that drive efficient microwave heating. Application of these principles is then described for the enhancement of boron-loaded solid propellants, the development of tunable microwave-absorbing composites, and the use of such composites to dynamically alter the sensitivity of microwave transparent energetics. Synthesis of the current literature reveals that carbon-based materials, metals, and metal oxides are the best solid-state targets for microwave heating and their use can enable localized energy deposition inside many other energetics, most of which are microwave transparent, or within the combustion zone. Microwave irradiation of propellants containing boron and boron carbide additives drives significant enhancement of burning rates as well as BO 2 and continuum emission, with very little change in condensed-phase temperature. The development of thermally-tunable, microwave-absorptive composites is described, and the effects of relevant process parameters are discussed in detail. The use of similar materials as susceptor particles in a simulated polymer-bound explosive is then described as a method for dynamically altering the sensitivity of an explosive. Finally, preliminary work on related aspects of these projects is described and recommendations for future work in the area of microwave enhancement and control of energetics are presented.",2022
Nitroacetonitrile as a versatile precursor in energetic materials synthesis,"Nitroacetonitrile is the simplest alpha-nitronitrile; it possesses a single central carbon attached to two strong electronegative, electron-withdrawing groups allowing extensive chemistry through the active methylene center. Free nitroacetonitrile has purification and stability issues, however stable salts of nitroacetonitrile possess the same reactivity as the free acid and are much more stable. Nitroacetonitrile serves as a versatile synthetic precursor in the formation of heterocyclic and polyfunctional aliphatic products and can allow for straightforward conversion to amino, acyl, and other functional groups. A main advantage of using nitroacetonitrile in the formation of heterocyclic-based energetics is its ability to add vicinal amino and nitro moieties onto fused ring structures, a common structural motif in insensitive energetic materials. In this minireview we discuss the preparation of nitroacetonitrile and its stable salts, as well as discuss the range of energetic materials this versatile precursor has found use in.",2020
Multi-physics modeling based on combustion of energetic materials,"We present an innovative method of multi-physics application involving energetic materials. Energetic materials are related to reacting flows in extreme environments such as fires and explosions. They typically involve high pressure, high temperature, strong non-linear shock waves, and high strain rate deformation of metals. We use an Eulerian methodology to address these problems. Our approach is naturally free from large deformation of materials that makes it suitable for high strain-rate multi-material interaction problems. Furthermore we eliminate the possible interface smearing by using the level sets. We have devised a new level set based tracking framework that can elegantly handle large gradients typically found in reacting gases and metals. We show several work-in-progress applications of our algorithm including the Taylor impact test, explosive venting and additional confined explosion problems of modem interest.",2008

"Synthesis, design and development of energetic materials: Quo Vadis?","Energetic materials are important class of functional compounds that combine the beauty of extreme high-energy chemistry with rigorous constraints on safety and performance. As a result, the development of energetic materials is a challenging process that require the best of computational, chemical synthesis, and material design techniques. This review discusses the state-of-art of the energetics field, and then highlights the most recent synthetic advancements that go beyond - regioisomerism impact, almost all-nitrogen species, new mesoionic ring fragments, and compounds bearing elements other than traditional CHNO. The computational advancements are summarized further: the material genome approaches and high-throughput virtual screening. Next, the material science and crystal engineering design tools are reviewed, from cocrystal design and host-guest inclusion to various polymer coating techniques.

Promising energetic materials composed of nanosilicon and solid oxidizers,"A method for production of mechanically activated energetic compositions consisting of nanosilicon and solid inorganic oxidizers is developed. For the compositions prepared, both high-speed burning and detonation are observed. The propagation of the reaction is accompanied by a high energy release, comparable to the heat of explosion of aluminized high explosives. The compositions are highly sensitive to thermal stimuli and capable of rapid deflagration-to-detonation transition. The results obtained in the work suggest that nanosilicon-based formulations as promising energetic materials for a wide range of applications, from initiating compositions in blasting caps to compositions for small charges in microsystem devices.",2012
Dynamic Shearing Resistance of an Energetic Material Simulant: Sucrose,"Sucrose is a commonly used energetic material simulant for beta-HMX. However, its behavior under extreme loading conditions remains poorly understood. Pressure-Shear Plate Impact (PSPI) experiments have been conducted to provide an experimental foundation for developing a suitable constitutive model for sucrose. Experiments have been performed at two different nominal normal stress values, 3 and 9.5 GPa, with nominal shear strain-rates of the order of 10(6) s(-1). Sucrose exhibits a shear strength of similar to 400-500 MPa in this pressure range, with a relatively small pressure sensitivity. However, pronounced strain softening is observed in sucrose at sufficiently large shear strains - even a dramatic drop in shearing resistance in some cases. A thermodynamically-consistent constitutive theory is presented to model the thermoelastic, thermo-viscoplastic response of sucrose. The use of the logarithmic strain and an appropriate set of invariants allows for separation of the Cauchy stress into pressure and deviatoric terms. A complete Mie-Gruneisen equation of state is presented to model the volumetric behavior while the deviatoric response is captured through the Johnson-Cook Model. The material model is able to capture experimental observations and predicts localization in the form of adiabatic shear bands, which explains the catastrophic drop in shearing resistance of sucrose observed in the experiments. Such localization events carry important implications for energetic materials in the context of hot-spot formation and underline the importance of dynamic shearing strength measurements.",2022
Can a Photosensitive Oxide Catalyze Decomposition of Energetic Materials?,"Organic-inorganic interfaces provide both intrigues and opportunities for designing systems that possess properties and functionalities inaccessible by each individual component. In particular, the electronic, catalytic, and defect properties of inorganic surfaces can significantly affect the adsorption, decomposition, and photoresponse of organic molecules. Here, we choose the formulation of TiO2 and trinitrotoluene (TNT), a highly catalytic oxide and a prominent explosive; as a prototypical example to explore the effect of a catalytic oxide additive on the photosensitivity of energetic, materials. We show that whether or not a catalytic oxide additive can help molecular decompositions under light illumination depends largely on the band alignment between the oxide surface and the energetic molecule: For the composite of TiO2 and TNT, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of TNT merge within the Conduction band (CB) of TiO2. As Such, no optical transition corresponding to available laser energies is observed. However, oxygen, vacancy can lead to electron density transfer from the surface to the energetic' molecules, causing an enhancement of the bonding between molecules and surface and a reduction of the molecular decomposition activation barriers. Therefore; when other (than optical) forms of energy (shock, heat, etc.) flow into molecules, molecular decompositions may be triggered more easily.",2017
Statistical assessment methods for the sensitivity of energetic materials,"The joint research project Particle Processing and Characterization was started in March 2003 under the EUROPA ERG1 Arrangement, with the objective to study the influence of crystallization and processing techniques on particle quality and its implication for the formulation of PBX with IM behavior. As sensitivity assessment is a crucial task of the project, impact sensitivity tests of HMX and RDX samples have been performed at two different laboratories, and several statistical techniques have been tested in addition to the standard BAM ""1/6"" and Bruceton ""up and down"" methods. When the ""go/no-go"" response is plotted against the stimuli, the obtained curve is a step function while the actual behavior of the impacted explosive should exhibit a sigmoid function. Therefore, we have investigated statistical methods for analyzing the experimental results and to determine this sigmoid curve by using a statistic assessment. We compared the results obtained by the ""1/6"" method, Bruceton, the logistic regression, and Probit analysis for several explosives. The investigation shows that the proposed alternative methods exhibit a useful capability to classify any explosive samples according to their respective sensitivity. This is of importance particularly for qualifying explosive formulations for their later potential use in insensitive or reduced sensitivity applications.",2008
Studies on compatibility of energetic materials by thermal methods,"Abstract: The chemical compatibility of explosives, pyrotechnics and propellants with those materials is studied to evaluate potential hazards when in contact with other materials during production, storage and handling. Compatibility can be studied by several thermal methods as DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), TG (Thermogravimetry), VST (Vacuum stability test) and others. The test methods and well defined criteria are the most important elements when a compatibility study is being accomplished. In this paper, the compatibility of two very important high explosives used in ammunition, RDX (Cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine) and HMX (Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine) was studied with the materials: fluoroelastomer (Viton) and powdered aluminum (Al), using DSC and VST methods. The criteria to judge the compatibility between materials is based on a standardization agreement (STANAG 4147, 2001), and the final conclusion is that explosives and this materials are compatible, but in DSC it was observed that the peak of decomposition temperature of the admixture of RDX with Al decreased in 3º C and another peak appeared after the decomposition peak.",0-04
Optical sensitising of insensitive energetic material for laser ignition,"An experimental investigation into optical sensitisation for laser ignition of an insensitive explosive 1,1-Diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) has been carried out, by using a near-infrared diode laser at a wavelength of 808 nm. In this study carbon black as the optical sensitiser was mixed at 5 wt% with the explosive using two different mixing techniques, tumble mix and ground mix. The mixture samples were characterised by microscopy to examine the dispersion of carbon black within the mixtures and analyse effects of the mixing techniques on their laser ignitability. Laser ignition maps were developed for both mixing techniques and varying sample densities also examined to determine the density effect on laser ignition with various laser parameters of beam width, laser duration and laser power. The results have shown that ground mixing method provides more uniform dispersion of carbon black in the mixture samples, and therefore allows a lower laser ignition threshold than that of tumble mixing method.",2023
Advanced crystalline energetic materials modified by coating/intercalation techniques,"In the field of energetic materials (EMs), the problems of sensitivity and relatively high cost limit their practical applications in certain conditions. Therefore, various newly developed high energetic compounds are still not in use. The balance between the energy density and safety of EMs remains a highly challenging task. Numerous strategies have been implemented to achieve this balance. The most typical ones are coating, intercalation, recrystallization, cocrystallization, hybridization and chemical grafting methods. Of all the mentioned modification methods, the coating/intercalation have been found to be the best and the most widely used ones, due to their safer but cost-effective operations with well-controlled procedures, which may result in products with tunable properties. In cases of coating/intercalation of energetic crystals, different coating agents and fabrication techniques, including the well-known water suspension, in-situ polymerization, physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have been applied to improve the thermal stability and mechanical sensitivity reduction of energetic crystals. The results show that the mechanical sensitivity and performances could be well-balanced in this way. This review summarizes the preparation methods and fundamental properties of coated/intercalated crystalline EMs. It demonstrates that the EMs with better performances could be made by appropriate modification methods, where the modified ammonium salts and nitramine crystals are presented as typical examples.",2021
Review of the Photodecomposition of Some Important Energetic Materials,"The photodecomposition mechanisms of energetic materials vary with molecular structure, photodissociation wavelength, the phase of the material, experimental pressure and temperature etc. In this paper, the significant progress on photodecomposition studies of some important energetic materials achieved in recent years is introduced in detail, including nitromethane, DMNA (dimethylnitramine), TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacycloctane) and CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane). The difficulties and prospects of photodecomposition research of energetic materials are also indicated.",2012
The stability of novel energetic materials and associated propellants,"A study into the degradation of crystalline Hydrazinium Nitroformate (HNF) in isolation has been carried out alongside studies into HNF / polyNIMMO propellant degradation. The contribution of gas / solid autocatalysis in the degradation of the crystalline phase has been determined to be very low. Studies via GC-MS analysis do suggest that the presence (and eventual release) of the crystal impurity, isopropyl alcohol, is a more significant contributor to the eventual autocatalytic breakdown of the crystal matrix. Investigations into the chemical compatibility of HNF with nitrosated and nitrated derivatives of 2NDPA and pNMA indicated that the reaction of HNF is most rapid with N-NO-2NDPA. This reaction between HNF and N-NO-2NDPA is proposed to be the principal route to rapid propellant degradation in 2NDPA stabilised propellant systems. Analysis of a range of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants has allowed development of a hypothesis for this family of propellant compositions over a range of temperatures. The data has indicated that the degradation of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants is a complex process involving a number of interrelated and interdependent reactions. It appears that a significantly different reaction scheme dominates at 80°C compared to either 60°C or 40°C. The incorporation of a 1% anhydrous sodium sulphite + 1% pNMA mixed stabiliser system has shown promise for use in propellant formulations up to temperature of 80°C. Some level of success in stabilisation has also been achieved using very high levels of pNMA within the propellant formulation.",2010
High-pressure studies of pharmaceutical compounds and energetic materials.,"The effects of high pressure on pharmaceutical compounds and energetic materials can have important implications for both the properties and performance of these important classes of material. Pharmaceutical compounds are frequently subjected to pressure during processing and formulation, causing interconversion between solid forms that may affect properties such as solubility and bio-availability. Energetic materials experience extremes of both pressure and temperature under conditions of detonation and deflagration, causing changes in properties such as sensitivity to shock and chemical reactivity. This tutorial review outlines the various methods used to study these materials at high pressure, describes how pressure can be used to explore polymorphism, and provides examples of compounds that have been studied at high pressure.",-Oct
High Pressure Study of Pharmaceutical and Energetic Material Hexamethylenetetramine,"This study presents the results of high-pressure Raman and angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) investigations conducted on hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, (CH2)(6)N-4), a hydrogen-bonded pharmaceutical and energetic material, across a range of pressures up to approximately 20 GPa. Notably, two distinct phase transitions at around 1.1 GPa and within the pressure interval of approximately 10 to 12.5 GPa were identified. Both Raman spectroscopy and ADXRD results substantiate the existence of these two phase transitions. The crystal structure of phase II could be indexed and refined as a tetragonal system with the P4/n space group, while phase III exhibits a tetragonal crystal system with the P4(1 )space group. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the observed transitions are fully reversible upon complete pressure release. Drawing upon the variations observed in the CNC, CN, and CH2 Raman modes within the high-pressure phases, we posit that the two phase transitions arise from the rearrangements within the hydrogen-bonded networks.",2023
Bond dissociation energy and thermal stability of energetic materials,"Thermal stability of energetic materials is often screened by differential scanning calorimetry and accelerating rate calorimetry measurements. On the other hand, bond dissociation energies can explain reactivity or stability of chemical compounds. Here bond dissociation energy was derived from standard enthalpies of formation estimated by semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations using the MOPAC-PM7 package. The weakest bond dissociation energies of energetic materials and their onset temperatures in differential scanning calorimetry and accelerating rate calorimetry measurements correlated well, except for molecules where decomposition was favored by effects like intermolecular interactions. Bond dissociation energies derived from molecular orbital calculations have been found useful to roughly predict onset temperatures in the calorimetric measurements for energetic materials where data may sometimes not be available.",2021
The Ignition Behaviour of Energetic Materials Under Confined Cookoff,"In a series of experiments and theoretical work, the process of ignition in confined energetic materials has been explored and understanding gained. Early work focused on the direct observation of the cook-off process but was hampered by the available technology. In more recent work, dynamic measurements of the deformation of the confinement have been explored, and refinements to the direct observation method have been made that make use of recent advances in camera technology. We have observed, for the first time, complex melting and development of gas spaces within which the early stages of ignition take place, and propose a new mechanism by which violent cook-off responses might develop in certain explosives. <",2018
Combustion of Energetic Materials Controlled by Condensed-Phase Reactions,"A combustion model controlled by condensed-phase reactions (c-phase combustion model) is considered. Based on an analysis of numerous thermocouple studies of combustion of energetic materials, it is shown that the condensed phase is heated in the combustion wave to the maximum possible temperature-the boiling point at this pressure. It is established that the combustion of representatives of the class of onium salts such as ammonium perchlorate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium dinitramide, and hydrazinium nitroformate over a wide range of pressures and initial temperatures obeys the the c-phase-model. The kinetic parameters of the burning-rate controlling reaction of these salts are given.",2012
Current Self-Healing Binders for Energetic Composite Material Applications,"Energetic composite materials (ECMs) are the basic materials of polymer binder explosives and composite solid propellants, which are mainly composed of explosive crystals and binders. During the manufacturing, storage and use of ECMs, the bonding surface is prone to micro/fine cracks or defects caused by external stimuli such as temperature, humidity and impact, affecting the safety and service of ECMs. Therefore, substantial efforts have been devoted to designing suitable self-healing binders aimed at repairing cracks/defects. This review describes the research progress on self-healing binders for ECMs. The structural designs of these strategies to manipulate macro-molecular and/or supramolecular polymers are discussed in detail, and then the implementation of these strategies on ECMs is discussed. However, the reasonable configuration of robust microstructures and effective dynamic exchange are still challenges. Therefore, the prospects for the development of self-healing binders for ECMs are proposed. These critical insights are emphasized to guide the research on developing novel self-healing binders for ECMs in the future.",2023
Predicting Melt Curves of Energetic Materials Using Molecular Models,"In this work, the solid-liquid coexistence curves of classical fully flexible atomistic models of alpha-RDX and beta-HMX were calculated using thermodynamically rigorous methodologies that identify where the free energy difference between the phases is zero. The free energy difference between each phase at a given state point was computed using the pseudosupercritical path (PSCP) method, and Gibbs-Helmholtz integration was used to evaluate the solid-liquid free energy difference as a function of temperature. This procedure was repeated for several pressures to determine points along the coexistence curve, which were then fit to the Simon-Glatzel functional form. While effective, this method is computationally expensive. An alternative approach is to compute the melting point at a single pressure via the PSCP method, and then use the Gibbs-Duhem integration technique to trace out the coexistence curve in a more computationally economical manner. Both approaches were used to determine the coexistence curve of alpha-RDX. The Gibbs-Duhem integration method was shown to generate a melt curve that is in good agreement with the PSCP-derived melt curve, while only costing similar to 10 % of the computational resources used for the PSCP method. For alpha-RDX, the predicted melting temperature increases significantly more for a given increase in pressure when compared to available experimental data.",2022
Three-dimensional simulations of void collapse in energetic materials,"The collapse of voids in porous energetic materials leads to hot-spot formation and reaction initiation. This work advances the current knowledge of the dynamics of void collapse and hot-spot formation using 3D reactive void collapse simulations in HMX. Four different void shapes, i.e., sphere, cylinder, plate, and ellipsoid, are studied. For all four shapes, collapse generates complex three-dimensional (3D) baroclinic vortical structures. The hot spots are collocated with regions of intense vorticity. The differences in the vortical structures for the different void shapes are shown to significantly impact the relative sensitivity of the voids. Voids of high surface area generate hot spots of greater intensity; intricate, highly contorted vortical structures lead to hot spots of corresponding tortuosity and therefore enhanced growth rates of reaction fronts. In addition, all 3D voids are shown to be more sensitive than their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts. The results provide physical insights into hot-spot formation and growth and point to the limitations of 2D analyses of hot-spot formation.",2018
Anisotropic constitutive relationships in energetic materials: PETN and HMX,"This paper presents results of first-principles density functional calculations of the equation of state (EOS) of PETN-I and beta-HMX. The isotropic EOS for hydrostatic compression has been extended to include uniaxial compressions in the [100], [010], [001], [110], [101], [011], and [111] directions up to compression ratio V/V-0 = 0.70. Equilibrium properties, including lattice parameters and elastic constants, as well as hydrostatic EOS are in good agreement with available experimental data. The shear stresses of uniaxially compressed PETN-I and beta-HMX have been evaluated and their behavior as a function of compression ratio has been used to make predictions of shock sensitivity of these EMs. A comparison of predicted sensitivities with available experimental data has also been performed.",2007
Decomposition behaviors of energetic materials immersed in molten salt,"Explosives are used in nuclear weapons to compress the fissle pit to criticality. With the dismantlement of thousands of nuclear weapons, methods for the safe destruction of explosive waste are being developed. The University of California, Davis and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories are currently studying the molten salt destruction process as an attractive means of destroying energetic materials in an environmentally benign fashion. For this study, immersion of energetic materials into high temperature molten salt baths, where the energetic materials decompose, was considered as a method for their safe destruction. The decomposition behaviors of the high explosives: LX-17 (92.5 wt% 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) plus 7.5 wt% Kel-F 800 plastic binder), LX-04 (85 wt% octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) plus 15 wt% Viton A plastic binder), and 2,6-Dinitrotoluene (DNT) were studied. Samples approximately 0.3-grams were immersed in molten salt baths, and data were taken photographically. Sample decomposition behaviors were observed for varied salt temperatures in a molten LiCl-NaCl-KCl eutectic and then separately in a molten Li 2 CO 3 -Na 2 CO 3 -K 2 CO 3 eutectic. General decomposition behaviors such as gas evolution and bubble formation characteristics, sample surface regression rates and sample lifetimes were observed in bath temperatures ranging from 650 to 750°C. During and after the decomposition of each material in the molten chloride eutectic, absorption and emission spectra were also measured. These UV-VIS spectroscopy data provided an indication of intermediate chemical reactions during sample decomposition. In addition to advancing fundamental knowledge, these results are of use for aiding in the design of molten-salt reactors.",1999
Iodine Pentoxide Nano-rods for High Density Energetic Materials,"The iodine pentoxide is one of the most advanced oxidizers for nanostructured energetic formulations among the thermites due to the highest energy release per volume 25.7 kJ cm(-3). The size and shape of iodine pentoxide particles have a strong impact on the pressurization rates during the reaction. Although micro-sized iodine pentoxide particles are commercially available, nano-sized particles, which are desired for various nano-energetic applications, are not available on the market. Conventional wet chemical methods are unable to produce iodine pentoxide nanoparticles due to high solubility in water. In this study, we demonstrate fabrication of iodine pentoxide nano-rods by high energy mechanical treatment of micro-sized I2O5 particles. Tuning the energy dose in high-energy ball milling is allowing to produce I2O5 nano-rods with diameter of 50-100 nm and length of 300-600 nm. The produced nano-rods exhibited 10% smaller decomposition energy compared to the precursor of micro particles. The experiments showed that the nano-energetic materials prepared with nano-sized I2O5 rods have pressure discharge value of 43.4 MPag(-1) which is two times higher than using commercial iodine pentoxide particles.",2017
Passivation of aluminum nanopowders for use in energetic materials,The reactivity of passivated aluminum nanopowders was studied. Organic coating has been shown to enhance the resistance of aluminum nanopartic1es to the effect of water vapor and causes changes in the parameters of the nonisothermal oxidation by air oxygen. Passivation of aluminum nanopowders has been established to increase the temperature of oxidation onset and the heat release rate.,2015
Phosphorus-based nanothermites: A new generation of energetic materials,"Thermites are energetic materials that are classically made of a transition metal oxide mixed with a reducing metal. Contrary to explosives, thermites do not detonate because their combustion is relatively slow and their reaction by-products are often solid or liquid. The use of nanoparticles to prepare superthermites is very promising. The dramatic changes observed in their reactivity were reported by numerous recent papers dealing with the use of aluminium as fuel. Red phosphorus is widely used in pyrotechnic devices. Highly explosive compositions are classically obtained by mixing this substance with strong oxidizers such as oxygenated potassium salts (chlorate, nitrate). But to our knowledge, the idea to prepare P-nanothermites with metallic oxide nanoparticles was never reported before. In order to illustrate this new concept of energetic formulations, P-nanothermites were prepared from nickel oxide (NiO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and copper oxide (CuO) nanopowders. The reactivity of these compositions was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, impact and friction tests, electrostatic discharge and high-speed cinematography. P-nanothermites are very insensitive to thermal and impact stress. Their combustion rates strongly depend on the nature of the oxide (NiO < Fe2O3 < CuO). The SEM observation of the microstructure of the residues produced by the combustion clearly indicates that they were formed by the solidification of molten phases. In other words, the energy released by the combustion of P-nanothermites provokes the melting of the reaction products. The temperatures reached are thus high enough to cause the gasification of phosphoric anhydride produced by the combustion. For this reason, P-nanothermites can be considered gas-generating materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010
Sonochemically induced decomposition of energetic materials in aqueous media.,"This study demonstrates that ultrasound rapidly degrades the energetic compounds RDX (cyclo-1,3,5-trinitramine-2,4,6-trimethylene) and ADN (ammonium dinitramide) in aqueous microheterogeneous media. The conditions for effective degradation of these nitramines, as monitored by UV absorption spectroscopy, were determined by varying sonication time, the heterogeneous phase and its suspension density, and the concentration of NaOH. In the presence of 5 mg/ml of aluminum powder and at pH approximately 12 (10 mM NaOH), 74% of the RDX and 86% of the ammonium dinitramide (ADN) in near-saturated solutions decompose within the first 20 min of sonication (20 kHz; 50 W; < or =5 degrees C). Sonication without Al powder and base yields minimal degradation of either RDX and ADN (approximately 5-10%) or the nitrite/nitrate ions that are expected byproducts during RDX and ADN degradation. Sonication at high pH in the presence of dispersed aluminosilicate zeolite, alumina, or titanium dioxide also yields minimal degradation. Preliminary electrochemical studies and product analyses indicate that in situ ultrasonic generation of metallic aluminum and/or aluminum hydride drives reductive denitration of the nitramines. Sonochemical treatment in the presence of a reductant offers an effective and rapid waste remediation option for energetic waste compounds. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.",-Mar
Ignition of solid energetic materials by hot gas impingement,"In the present work, a mathematical model has been developed to simulate the ignition of solid energetic materials by hot gas impingement. The first part of the current research included studying the transient conjugate heat transfer between the stagnation region and a non-reactive solid disk. An explicit finite difference technique was used to solve the case of transient, forced convective conjugate heat transfer between an axisymmetric incompressible laminar impinging jet and a solid disk. The solution to the governing equations is based on the assumptions of constant physical properties and no viscous dissipation. The hydrodynamics of the flow are considered to be steady state, while thermal transients take place with a step temperature change at the jet upstream boundary condition. In this part, the effect of the ratios of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity between fluid and solid on transient heat transfer characteristics of the system have been investigated. In the second part of this thesis, the numerical method of lines was used to develop a model that simulates the ignition of an energetic material driven by hot gas impingement. This model was applied to several types of conventional energetic materials such as RDX, HMX, TNT, TATB, and NC. In this part, a reduced chemical reaction mechanism was adopted to simulate the chemical changes within the solid disk that were associated with the heat addition process and eventually lead to the onset of ignition. The results presented the effects of several issues on the ignition process. These issues include: the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow, the gas-temperature at the jet-exit, the physical properties of the solid materials and the impinging gases, the ambient temperature, and the chemical kinetic characteristics of the chemical reactions. The current investigation was extended to discuss the validity of some common assumptions that often appeared in the literature. These assumptions are: (1) constant physical properties, (2) semi-infinite solid geometry, (3) one-dimensionality, (4) no radiation absorption at the solid surface, (5) steady state consideration of the gas region, and (6) the inert heating approach.",1995
Ignition in solid energetic materials due to electrical discharge,"Fatal mishaps have been blamed on accidental ignition of solid rocket propellant by electrostatic discharge (ESD). Despite study of this problem since the first incident in 1985 involving a Pershing II motor stage, our understanding of ESD ignition remains limited. To determine the physics of electrically-induced ignition, the temperature, density, and size of electrical arc channels have been quantified during electrical discharge experiments on a composite solid propellant. This material consists of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum, and hydroxyterminated polybutadiene (HTPB). To simulate the discharge in ESD scenarios involving insulated motors, a charged cable pulser provided electrical discharges with durations from 50 to 400 ns. The lowest ignition energy for these experiments was 160 $\pm$ 1.4 mJ. (Ignition was defined as establishment of a sustained reaction determined experimentally by total consumption of the sample.) Measurements from pressure transducers placed 3.18 mm from the arc channel showed no reaction occurred in the propellant during the discharge. In addition, infrared detectors measured time-to-reaction following the discharge; the shortest induction time was 5.7 $\pm$ 0.2 ms. These results indicate a relatively slow thermally-induced reaction rather than prompt ignition from a shock wave. A high-speed framing camera (2 $\times$ 10$\sp7$ frames/sec) observed expansion of the arc channel as electrical energy was deposited. A 61.8 $\pm$ 21.4 $\mu$m radius channel was observed for an energy deposition of 850 mJ over 400 ns. An analytical model was adapted to predict arc channel expansion for various discharge profiles. Spectra taken at intervals during the discharge indicate the plasma reaches an equilibrium temperature of 13,000 K. Post-test dissection of inert samples revealed the arc channel forms in the binder material around the crystalline constituents. Plasma density was estimated assuming the plasma mass corresponds to the mass of binder trapped by initial formation of the discharge channel: the value is 150 $\pm$ 66 kg/m$\sp3$. The trapped aluminum was excluded from this calculation because insufficient energy exists to evaporate it. An ignition model based on energy transport, via radiation and thermal conduction, from the plasma to the surrounding energetic constituents is proposed. A one-dimensional thermal-chemical kinetics code, XCHEM, was used to demonstrate the importance of radiation in the ignition model.",1996
"Nitroimino as an energetic group in designing energetic materials for practical use, a tautomerism from nitroamino","Energetic materials are widely used as energy components in military and civilian applications, which require high energy, and good safety, and are inexpensive and environmentally friendly. As an easily synthesized high-energy group, nitroamino can provide excellent energetic properties to a system. Compared with other energetic groups, nitroamino itself has the ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB). The nitroamino undergoes a hydrogen transfer process to generate nitroimino, which forms intramolecular HBs unexpectedly, resulting in a larger conjugated system. The generation of secondary bonds promotes the stability and planarity of the system, thus favoring a series of important parameters such as density, thermal stability, and sensitivity, providing a theoretical basis for the design of nitroamino-substituted explosives with balanced energy and safety. This facilitates the development of high energy density materials (HEDMs) for aerospace, military and civilian applications. The hydrogen transfer process of the nitroamino system can be understood as one in which the nitroamino moiety becomes stable by changing the structure of the backbone or other substituent groups. However, the construction strategies and properties of nitroimino energetics have attracted little attention and are far from being fully exploited. The summarization of views and possible construction ideas will provide new opportunities. In this review, some important nitroimino-substituted explosives have been included to confirm the guiding role of hydrogen transfer strategy by capturing their structural features. Through comprehensive analysis of the skeleton structure, synthesis method, and performance characteristics, we strive to provide a macroscopic view of nitroimino explosives including the mechanism of the self-stabilizing hydrogen transfer, the improved performance, and the blueprint for the future design of HEDMs based on these characteristics.",2023
Polycyclic ,"Polycyclic N-oxides were developed based on the heterocycles 1,2,4,5-tetrazine and 4H, 8H-difurazano[3,4-b:3',4'-e]pyrazine. The new compounds are energetic and have excellent explosive properties, while maintaining low mechanical sensitivities. Most notably, compound 7 is thermally stable, insensitive, and has superior detonation properties to the state-of-the-art insensitive high explosive, 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene.",2019
"An aldehyde-group-containing energetic ZIF with unprecedented ""negative"" catalytic properties for seven different energetic materials","Energetic materials possessing high energy content, exceptional heat resistance, and insensitivity have long been recognized as a significant and prominent subject of academic debate. In this study, the necessity for high-energy explosives in both military and civilian domains prompted the introduction of the concept of an ""energetic negative -burning rate catalyst"" in heat -resistant and insensitive energetic materials. Therefore, a typical and effective catalyst (ZIF-90) was discovered. ZIF-90, which can be easily synthesized and features a large specific surface area and regular pore structure, contributes to molecular -scale changes in the pyrolysis process of energetic materials. Additionally, the presence of surface aldehyde groups facilitates the partial absorption of heat, thereby collectively contributing to the augmentation of pyrolysis peak temperatures for seven distinct energetic materials (RDX, HMX, CL -20, LLM-105, LLM-126, AlH3, and DAP -4). Specifically, the pyrolysis peak temperatures were elevated by 6.6 degrees C, 1.7 degrees C, 1.6 degrees C, 6.4 degrees C, 1.4 degrees C, 13.1 degrees C, and 7.0 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the highly stable ZIF-90, functioning as an intrinsically insensitive Energetic Metal -Organic Framework (EMOF), not only effectively mitigates the sensitivity of energetic materials but also ensures minimal energy loss. Notably, the incorporation of a mere 5 wt% of ZIF-90 resulted in a significant enhancement of over one -fold in the heat resistance of LLM-105-based explosive cylinders, thereby validating the practical applicability of ZIF-90 in energetic materials. Moreover, the efficacy of ZIF-90 in solid propellant formulations was corroborated through flame experiments conducted on solid propellants. The development of such a pragmatic and universally applicable energetic negative -burning rate catalyst presents a promising strategy for the future advancement of highperformance, heat -resistant, and insensitive energetic materials.",2023
Energetic materials based on poly furazan and furoxan structures,"Furazan and furoxan represent fascinating explosophoric units with intriguing structures and unique properties. Compared with other nitrogen-rich heterocycles, most poly furazan and furoxan-based heterocycles demonstrate superior energetic performances due to the higher enthalpy of formation and density levels. A large variety of advanced energetic materials have been achieved based on the combination of furazan and furoxan moieties with different kinds of linkers and this review provides an overview of the development of energetic poly furazan and furoxan structures during the past decades, with their physical properties and detonation characteristics summarized and compared with traditional energetic materials. Various synthetic strategies towards these compact energetic structures are highlighted by covering the most important cyclization methods for construction of the hetercyclic scaffolds and the following modifications such as nitrations and oxidations. Given the synthetic availabilities and outstanding properties, energetic materials based on poly furazan and furoxan structures are undoubtedly listed as a promising candidate for the development of new-generation explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics.

Comprehensive assessment of physicochemical properties of new energetic materials,"The review presents original methodological approaches and summarizes the results of research into the assessment of relationships between the structure of energetic organic compounds and their main physicochemical properties. A large number of experimental values of these parameters were statistically analyzed, and a database of the properties of explosives and rocket propellant ingredients was created. Based on the analysis and integration of these data, approaches were developed to evaluate the fundamental properties of energetic compounds of different chemical classes, such as the enthalpy of formation, the molecular crystal density, and the sensitivity to mechanical impacts. The explosive and ballistic characteristics were calculated. The comprehensive assessment was made of the possible applications of new substances and those poorly characterized by experimental methods.",2016
Molecular modeling of energetic materials and chemical warfare agents,"Contamination of military sites by energetic materials and chemical warfare agents is a growing problem. To avoid health hazards associated with these compounds, it is necessary to decontaminate or remediate the contaminated sites. Effective decontamination requires knowledge of environmental fate of contaminants and the appropriate remediation methodologies. While the fate of chemical warfare agents are well studied, the impact of certain energetic materials in the environment is relatively unknown. So the current focus is determining environmental fate of Insensitive Munitions (IM) which are energetic materials that have low shock sensitivity and high thermal stability and developing detection schemes for identifying chemical warfare agents. For energetic materials, the environmental fate can be assessed by determining the partition coefficients, especially the octanol-water partition coefficient and Henry's law constant. For chemical warfare agents, the most important criteria for developing sensors is the detection selectivity. Carbon adsorbents are a simple and effective way of increasing the sensor selectivity for the contaminants by concentration or prefiltration through physical adsorption. So it is necessary to study the adsorption behavior of the contaminants in carbon slit pores as a preliminary step to the sensing process. In this work, molecular modeling or simulation is proposed as a theoretical tool to determine thermophysical properties that aid in understanding how certain energetic materials behave in the environment and developing techniques for detecting chemical warfare agents. Molecular modeling is a promising alternative to experiments due to the hazardous nature of these compounds and the long experimental time scales involved in their testing. Molecular models or force fields are developed to predict various thermophysical properties. For energetic materials, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict properties such as octanol-water partition coefficiens, Henry's law constant and also critical parameters, vapor pressure, boiling point, lattice parameters, crystal density and melting point. For chemical warfare agents, the developed force fields are used to determine their phase coexistence properties, vapor pressures, critical parameters, pure and mixture isotherms with water over carbon slit pore using atomistic Monte Carlo simulations.",2010
A Guiding Simulation Research on Developing Promising Energetic Materials,"This investigation is motivated by the representative synthesis reaction of 1,4,5,8-tetranitro-1,4,5,8-tetraazadecalin (TNAD): ethylene diamine is replaced by 1,1,diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) or 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) to react with glyoxal in order to subsequently obtain promising high energy density materials. The hybrid density functional theory method is used in calculations for some series of compounds with -N-NO2 and -C-NO2 functional groups. First, we create the corresponding Cartesian coordinates of the molecules under investigation and obtain their optimized molecular geometry; the Molecular enthalpy can then be used to calculate the molecular detonation heat upon explosion. Furthermore, the target molecular volumes are obtained using the group additivity approach, which are then transferred into molecular densities. The densities and detonation heats of the corresponding energetics are carried in to the Kamlet-Jacobs empirical equations to determine the related detonation velocities and detonation pressures. It was found that 10 of 14 TATB- and FOX7-related molecular derivatives have detonation velocities between 9,302 and 1,1122 m/s and between 396 and 646 kbar, and are superior in performance to the traditional octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) explosive.

Impact ignition of nano and micron composite energetic materials,"Nanoscale reactive materials demonstrate three orders of magnitude reduced laser ignition sensitivity compared to their micron scale counterparts. Reduced ignition delay times have been reported for a variety of nano composites including aluminum combined with another metal (e.g., Ni), metallic oxides (e.g., MoO3, Fe2O3, CuO, WO3), or polymer binders such as polytetrafloroethylene (Teflon (TM)). A new reported melt dispersion mechanism associated with nano-aluminum particle ignition explains the enhanced thermal ignition sensitivity associated with nano-aluminum composites. As a comparison to laser thermal ignition behaviors, this study focuses on impact induced ignition of nano- and micron-aluminum particle composites that also include Ni, MoO3, or Teflon. A modified type-12 impact tester is used to measure ignition of the energetic composites to drop weight impact. Ignition is determined using high-speed thermal imaging. To assess the influence of the alumina passivation shell on the ignition dynamics, oxide-free nano-aluminum passivated with a perfluoroalkyl carboxylate self-assembled monolayer has also been investigated. Results show that the difference in ignition sensitivity between nano and micron composites is significantly greater with laser than with mechanical ignition and the melt dispersion mechanism does not describe impact ignition.

"Energetic materials: Crystallization, characterization and insensitive plastic bonded explosives","The product quality of energetic materials is predominantly determined by the crystallization process applied to produce these materials. It has been demonstrated in the past that the higher the product quality of the solid energetic ingredients, the less sensitive a plastic bonded explosive containing these energetic materials becomes. The application of submicron or nanometric energetic materials is generally considered to further decrease the sensitiveness of explosives. In order to assess the product quality of energetic materials, a range of analytical techniques is available. Recent attempts within the Reduced-sensitivity RDX Round Robin (R4) have provided the EM community a better insight into these analytical techniques and in some cases a correlation between product quality and shock initiation of plastic bonded explosives containing (RS-)RDX was identified, which would provide a possibility to discriminate between conventional and reduced sensitivity grades. In this paper experimental results of two relatively new crystallization techniques are shown. Submicron and nanometric RDX particles have been produced and characterized. Also results on the characterization of different commercial RDX grades will be shown, including data related to a part of the samples received within the R4 programme. Finally, experimental data will be presented and discussed on insensitive plastic bonded explosives (PBXs).",2008
Kinetic and mechanistic decomposition studies on advanced energetic materials,"The objective of this dissertation was to determine the decomposition characteristics of several newer energetic materials under combustion-like conditions by T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy. Hydrazinium nitroformate (HNF) was examined between 130-400$\sp\circ$C, which includes melt/foam decomposition and self-ignition regimes. Reaction regimes included evaporation, conversion to $m NH\sb4\lbrack C(NO\sb2)\sb3brack,$ and progressive decomposition to $m CO\sb2,$ CO, N$\sb2$O, NO, and H$\sb2$O. Induction-time decomposition kinetics $(E\sb{m a}$ = 25 kcal/mol, ln (B, s$\sp{-1})$ = 25.3) of the melt/foam layer were determined from time-to-exotherm and agree reasonably well with previously reported temperature-profile data. Thirteen 5- and 6-member nitrogen heterocycles and acyclic compounds were shown to convert into melon-like, cyclic azine residues when heated to $T\ge500\sp\circ$C. The gaseous products were also determined by IR spectroscopy. The melon-like residue could suppress the burning rate if these compounds are formulated into solid rocket propellants. Discrepancies in the published global kinetic data for the thermal decomposition of 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (NTO) were shown to result partly from inadequate consideration of the competing processes of sublimation and thermal decomposition. These processes were isolated and their kinetics determined. For sublimation, $E\sb{m a}=25.8$ kcal/mol, ln (A, s$\sp{-1})=29.2$ (isothermal at 0.002 atm); $E\sb{m a}=28.6$ kcal/mol, ln(A, s$\sp{-1})=31.3$ (nonisothermal at 0.002 atm). Decomposition kinetics on semi-confined NTO (20 atm Ar pressure) determined by T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy yield $E\sb{m a}=87.1$ kcal/mol and ln (A, s$\sp{-1})=74.8.$ From these and reported data, the kinetic constants for decomposition alone are $E\sb{m a}=78{-}87$ kcal/mol and ln (A, s$\sp{-1})=67{-}78.$ Lower values of the Arrhenius parameters result predominately or partly from sublimation. An evaluation was made of whether T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy could determine the decomposition kinetics $(E\sb{m a}$ and ln A) and thermochemical $(\Delta H\sb{m d})$ constants of an energetic material at high temperature and high heating rate. Polystyrene peroxide (PSP) was selected, and the kinetic constants were found to be appropriate for O-O bond homolysis as the rate determining step: $E\sb{m a}=39$ kcal/mol, ln (A, s$\sp{-1})=21.5.$ Significant uncertainty exists, however, in the estimation of $\Delta H\sb{m d}.$",1996
Atomic force microscopy of an energetic material: Ammonium perchlorate,"We have built an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) atomic force microscope (AFM). The UHV AFM has been operated at room temperature in atmosphere and down to the 10$\sp{-9}$ Torr scale. We have studied the structure and mechanical properties of an energetic material, ammonium perchlorate (NH$m\sb4ClO\sb4$, AP) which is hygroscopic using this instrument. Atomic force microscopy study on the (210) plane of AP revealed several interesting surface dynamics induced by the scanning tip. We were able to observe nano-scale surface sensitization caused by the scanning tip during repeated raster scanning while tip-sample contact was maintained. This sensitization appears as bright dots in topographic images, but is not a part of the topographic structures. In a large scale, the same repeated action can cause dramatic morphological change such as forming a roughening pattern when the surface was exposed to moisture. Furthermore, surface ripples with shallow amplitudes and giant wavelengths were discovered while imaging on flat areas in a large scale. Their dimensions depend on the local surface structures and their wave vectors are usually keyed to the main crystalline directions. Unfortunately, we have also discovered a new optical artifact that can produce similar images. All the real effects are interpreted in terms of strain relaxation of the surfaces, which are under mechanical stress coming from several different sources in the presence of moisture.",1996
A STUDY OF FRAGMENTATION IN A NI plus AL STRUCTURAL ENERGETIC MATERIAL,"A study of fragmentation behavior in a Ni+Al structural energetic material was undertaken. Rings were fabricated from a Ni+Al structural energetic material and subjected to explosive fragmentation. Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) data and ring fragments were collected and analyzed. Fragment sizes were found to be much smaller than those typical of ductile metals like copper and aluminum. This is attributed to the unique microstructure of the Ni+Al material. Additionally, a TNT charge cased with Ni+Al was detonated to cause the fragmentation of the Ni+Al case; high-speed photography showed Ni+Al fragments igniting upon oblique impact with a white photographic background.",2012
"MULTISCALE MODELING OF ENERGETIC MATERIAL RESPONSE: EASY TO SAY, HARD TO DO","In recent years, multiscale modeling has routinely been included in materials research programs (including those involving energetic materials). However, too often the various models are applied in a piecemeal fashion due to the fledgling state of multiscale modeling. While the concept of multiscale modeling of energetic materials is straightforward, practical implementation of this type of hierarchical modeling is hindered by numerous technical challenges. Here we report our efforts in establishing a multiscale modeling capability to predict energetic material response and include a discussion of emerging models, methods and software, stumbling blocks, and paths forward in this new area of exploration within our laboratory.",2012
Standoff LIBS measurements of energetic materials using a 266nm excitation laser,"A Deep-UV LIBS system has been constructed for the standoff detection of Explosives, and potentially Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) substances. A Q-Switched Nd:YAG Laser operating in at 266nm was used for excitation of the LIBS plasma and future Raman excitation. This plasma was enhanced by the means of a nearly simultaneous CO2 laser which results in a method referred to as Townsend Effect Plasma Spectroscopy (TEPS). Spectra covering the range of 240 - 800nm at standoff distances are presented. The classical emission lines (i.e. C, N, O, H, etc) of the energetic samples were observed and a peak ratio technique was used to differentiate between benign and energetic samples of interest.",2008
Energetic materials: alpha-NTO crystallizes as a four-component triclinic twin.,"The prevalent polymorph of the energetic material 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4,-triazol-3-one, alpha-NTO, crystallizes as a four-component twin with triclinic symmetry (space group P\bar 1). All crystals under investigation were fourlings, i.e. they contained each of the four possible twin components. Complete data sets were collected for two crystals, one with a predominant amount of one individual component (55%) and one with approximately equal volumes of each component. In both cases the fourling components are related by the twofold axes inherent in the holohedral symmetry of a pseudo-orthorhombic superlattice with a(o) = a(t), b(o) = b(t) and c(o) = a(t) + b(t) + 2c(t). The triclinic unit cell contains four crystallographically independent planar molecules in the asymmetric unit, each of which forms a hydrogen-bonded flat chain parallel to a(t). Pairs of chains are combined into planar ribbons by additional hydrogen bonds. Thus, two independent ribbons extend parallel to a(t), creating a dihedral angle of approximately 70 degrees. The origin of the twinning is derived from consideration of the crystal packing and the hydrogen-bonding scheme.",-Oct
FIRST-PRINCIPLES STUDIES OF HYDROSTATIC AND UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION OF A NEW ENERGETIC MATERIAL-AN ENERGETIC NITRATE ESTER,"Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with an empirical van der Waals (vdW) correction were performed on a new energetic material (EM), a nitrate ester that was recently synthesized by Chavez et al. [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47, 8307 (2008)]. This EM was shown to have physical properties superior to another nitrate ester, PETN. The equilibrium structure was calculated by vdW-DFT in excellent agreement with experiment (to within about 0.6% of the equilibrium volume of the unit cell). From the hydrostatic-compression simulation, the isothermal equation of state and bulk modulus was predicted prior to any known experimental results. In addition, uniaxial compressions were simulated in the < 100 >, < 010 >, < 001 >, < 110 >, < 101 >, < 011 >, and < 111 > directions to examine the anisotropic quality of the constitutive relationships. The calculated physical properties of the nitrate ester at extreme conditions are compared with other important EMs.",2009
"Energetic compounds featuring bi(1,3,4-oxadiazole): a new family of insensitive energetic materials","In this contribution, 5,5'-bis(trinitromethyl)-2,2'-bi(1,3,4-oxadiazole) (4) and 11 nitrogen-rich salts featuring bi(1,3,4-oxadiazole) were synthesised. Compound 4 was obtained by nitration of 2,2'-bi(1,3,4-oxadiazolyl)-5,5'-diacetic acid and the salts (6, 8-17) were prepared by facile deprotonation and metathesis reactions. All compounds were characterized by IR, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The structures of 6, 9 and 15 were further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical as well as energetic properties of these compounds including density, thermal stability and sensitivity were investigated. Except for 12 and 15, most of the salts decompose at temperatures over 180 degrees C. The performance data from the calculated heats of formation and experimental densities indicate that many of the salts have potential applications as energetic materials. The tested sensitivities of these compounds illustrate that they are less sensitive than RDX towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge.",2017
Structure-Property Relationship in Energetic Cationic Metal-Organic Frameworks: New Insight for Design of Advanced Energetic Materials,"Understanding the structure-property relationship in a material is of great importance in materials science. To study the effect of ligand backbones and anionic groups on the properties of energetic cationic metal-organic frameworks (CMOFs) and to disclose their structure-property relationships, we designed and synthesized a series of CMOFs based on either 4,4'-bi-1,2,4-triazole (btrz) or its azo analogous, 4,4'-azo-1,2,4-triazole (atrz) as ligand, and either perchlorate [ClO4-] or nitroformate [C(NO2)(3)(-), NF-] anion as extra-framework anion. Surprisingly, the effect of ligand backbones on the CMOFs is inverse that of the backbones on traditional energetic compounds, while the effect of the anionic groups follows the traditional group law. We found that btrz-based CMOFs exhibit higher densities and better chemical and thermal stabilities than those of their corresponding atrz-based CMOFs, although btrz has a lower density and a lower stability than atrz. In particular, the density of btrz-Fe is more than 0.11 g cm(-3) higher than that of its atrz-based analogue (atrz-Fe). Moreover, the decomposition temperature of btrz-Zn (363 degrees C) is 80 degrees C higher than that of atrz-Zn, even higher than that of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), making it a potential heat-resistant explosive. The effect mechanisms were also discussed according to the experimental results. This investigation is significant for understanding the structure-property relationship in energetic CMOFs. Moreover, it also brings about new design rules for future high-performance energetic materials.",2018
Processing Studies of Energetic Materials using Resonant Acoustic Mixing Technology,"Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) technology is attracting growing attention as an alternative and improved processing method for energetic materials. This paper describes studies that BAE Systems Land UK has carried out on RAM process parameters and material characterisation, in comparison with conventionally produced compositions. RAM technology transfers acoustic wave energy to mechanical movement under resonant conditions. The vibration action created can be used to complete various processes, not limited to coating, sieving, and mixing of materials. Current manufacturing methods within the energetics field can involve large amounts of solvents, long processing times, high waste output, high shear moving parts, and have single large batch limitations. Investigations into the manufacturing of energetic materials (for example, polymer bonded explosives (PBXs), propellants and pyrotechnics) via RAM technology have highlighted many potential advantages. These include the potential for solvent reduction (whether in processing stages, or clean-up), shorter time scales, improved mix homogeneity, reduced waste output due to flexibility of load/batch size, and the absence of moving parts (a potential ignition source). In addition, RAM can process higher viscosity products, giving opportunity for the development of new families of energetics. Land UK has been investigating the ability of RAM to process a range of different energetic materials, including PBXs and Low Vulnerability Ammunition (LOVA) propellant formulations. These studies have involved processing energetic materials using Resodyn's LabRAM and LabRAM II to find suitable manufacturing parameters, then carrying out material analyses to verify material quality. Where possible these data have been compared with those for conventionally produced materials. In addition to physical, chemical, and thermal analysis, in some cases, hazard sensitiveness and performance testing have also been undertaken. Thus far, trials have indicated that RAM technology produces energetic formulations that are at least equal in quality to materials processed using conventional methods, with RAM presenting the advantages listed above.",
"COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES ON NOVEL ENERGETIC MATERIALS: TETRANITRO-[2,2]PARACYCLOPHANES","Computational studies on tetranitro derivatives of [2,2]paracyclophane are carried out at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Optimized geometries, electronic structures and some thermodynamic properties have been obtained in their ground states. Also, detonation performances were evaluated by the Kamlet-Jacobs equations, based on the quantum-chemical calculated densities and heat of formation values. Aromaticities were investigated by performing NICS (nucleus independent chemical shift) calculations using the gauge invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) approach at the same theoretical level. The results show that these kinds of compounds possess some properties of energetic materials and if these stable tetra-nitro substituted [2,2]paracyclophanes can be synthesized, they may be potential candidates for powerful energetic materials.",2009
Broadband Terahertz Analysis of Energetic Materials-Influence of Crystal Structure and Additives,"A detailed broadband analysis of energetic materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy with a bandwidth from 0.2 to 6.4 THz is presented. Dependencies of the resonance features on different sample parameters are evaluated via spectroscopic investigation of several energetic materials (TNT, C4, RDX, PETN, AN) in transmission and reflection experiments. A strong dependency of the resonance features on the manufacturing process of an explosive is observed especially with TNT. The THz measurements of the TNT samples are compared to powder X-ray diffraction measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that additive compounds with a flat frequency response offset the THz reflection of an explosive, but the recognition capability of a resonance feature is not influenced.",2013
Effects of Dense Inert Particle Loading in Shocked Energetic Materials,"Metal particles are often added to solid-fuel rocket motors and weapon systems to boost detonation propagation or to increase impact energy. Aside from the chemical effects of reactive particles, even inert particle effects can be significant on detonation properties due to the momentum and the energy exchanges between the phases. Therefore, a study of inert particles, that can exhibit direct effects on shock-to-detonation-transition (SDT) depending on particle loading and its material properties, is needed. This work numerically investigates the effects of dense inert particle loading on SDT in energetic material (EM). The focus here is on local non-equilibrium (NE) effects in particle-added EM mixture and its correspondence to observed parametric trends on detonation. An Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) framework capable of modeling dense-dilute particles is used within a well-established multi-phase solver to capture dispersed motion in a reactive condensed phase. The numerical approach is first validated against available experimental data, and this is followed by an investigation of particle effects over a range of parameters where a condition-dependent trend is observed. Focusing on the two-phase NE effects, the dynamic and the thermal disparities between particles and EM are quantified to demonstrate the effect of relaxation parameters on the observed detonation quantities. The reduction in peak pressure and detonation velocity is observed to follow NE strengths and corresponding relaxation rates. An assessment of the effects of various particle loading parameters, i. e., concentration, size, density, and specific heat, on SDT is performed along with quantifying the relaxation process. All particle loading parameters show a range-dependent effect on detonation properties, and the observed results demonstrate the relevance of two-phase NE and corresponding relaxation processes.",2022
First Step Toward a Radical Polymer-Based Conductive Energetic Material,"Plastic bonded explosives (PBXs) and composite propellants (CPs) have yet to fully leverage the electrically conductive capability of polymers and nanomaterials. A PBX or CP with a high degree of electrical conductivity could be utilized for many different applications. In this work, an electrically conductive radical polymer is used as a binder in mock PBX formulations. Specifically, poly(4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) (PTEO) was copolymerized with glycidyloxy-benzophenone (GBP) to create PTEO-co-GBP (PTEO-GBP), and this was blended with sugar, which acted as a solid energetic simulant. Crosslinking of PTEO-GBP and the sugarPTEO-GBP composites revealed both thermal and UV curing mechanisms for the polymer. Finally, silver nanowires (AgNWs) were added to impart macroscale conductivity to the mock PBX composites. Due to the intrinsic conductivity of the PTEO moiety, only low loadings of AgNWs were required to observe an electrical conductivity of ~1 S cm-1 . Additionally, this level of AgNWs mechanically reinforced the composite, producing a mechanically robust mock PBX. Thus, this study presents the first step in developing a highly conductive energetic composite that utilizes a radical polymer as the binder and is capable of being resistively heated.",2022
Computational Design of Novel Energetic Materials: Dinitro-bis-triazolo-tetrazine,"The quantum-chemical computational methods are used to design a new highly energetic heterocyclic molecule DNBTT, 2,7-dinitro-4H,9H-bis([1,2,4]-triazolo)[1,5- b:1',5'-e][1,2,4,5]tetrazine. We analyze and predict the structure and a range of its properties. DNBTT has high energy content (i.e., high performance) and exhibits a high stability (i.e., low sensitivity) due to two triazole rings connected via a central tetrazine ring. A relatively high activation barrier needs to be overcome to trigger the thermal decomposition of DNBTT, indicating that the sensitivity of DNBTT is on par with (or better than) the benchmark stability of TATB. Additionally, decomposition chemistry can be controlled optically or electronically. Thus, it is expected that DNBTT is an excellent candidate energetic substance with low sensitivity and high performance and is attractive on its own or as a component in composite energetic formulations to improve their properties.",2015
Nano-scale spinning detonation in a condensed phase energetic material,"A single-headed spinning detonation wave is observed in molecular dynamics simulations of a condensed phase detonation of an energetic material confined to a round tube. The EM is modeled using a modified AB reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential. The simulated spinning detonation is similar to those observed in the gas phase. However, in addition to the incident, oblique, and transverse shock waves well known from gas-phase spinning detonations, a contact shock wave generated by a contact discontinuity is uncovered in our MD simulations.",2014
Sublimation Rate of Energetic Materials in Air: RDX and PETN,"This paper reports measurements of RDX and PETN sublimation rate in air. For both explosives the initial samples were prepared by precipitation from solution. For RDX a continuous thin film is obtained, while PETN samples were constituted of small, well separated, single crystals. The sublimation process was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). It is demonstrated that a quantitative description of the sublimation rates can be obtained using molecular diffusion equations in the surrounding air. A quantitative description is limited by the large discrepancy of the reported vapor pressure of these explosives in the literature. An additional obstacle in the accuracy of these predictions is the limited data related to vapor-in-air diffusion coefficients. The results reported herein allow us to determine the most relevant vapor pressure source among those reported in the literature and the most probable diffusion coefficient values.",2012
Study on Acoustic model for underwater explosion of energetic material,"Based on the similarity principle for underwater explosion, we proposed an acoustic model for underwater explosion of energetic materials (TNT and RDX) with different charge weights. The pressure of shock wave peak depends on the kinds and the charge weights of energetic materials. As a result, the source-level and the acoustic transmission loss of different frequencies were obvious. With the augment of the charge weight, the pressure of shock wave peak and the source-level of the TNT and RDX were exponentially increased. But the amount of source-level was not obviously increased to the extent of the charge weight. The results can provide some help references to the underwater acoustic interference.",2010
Determination of polymer content in energetic materials by FT-IR,"Abstract: A new methodology was developed to characterize and to quantify the polymer content in PBX (HMX/Viton) by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), using the Termogravimetric analysis (TG) as reference techniques for the quantitative method. The quantification methodology, proposed by us, using the Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR/ATR) showed excellent results, being faster than the usual methodologies and can eliminate the generation of chemical residues.",9-12
Mechanochemical processes in energetic materials : a computational and experimental investigation,"Energetic materials (explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics; EMs) encompass a broad range of materials. These materials are used across a wide spectrum of applications, including civil and defence. For example, HMX, RDX and TNT are well known EMs with defence applications. Silver fulminate is instead used in house-hold Christmas crackers and ammonium nitrate is used for numerous industrial applications. Common to all EMs is their propensity to rapidly release energy upon external perturbation. The amount and type of energy that is required to initiate an EM can vary across orders of magnitude. Some materials (e.g. triaminotriperoxide, TATP) initiate with < 1 J of impact energy, while others (e.g. triaminotrinitrobenzene, TATB) cannot be initiated without > 100 J of impact energy. Understanding which materials can be handled safely is therefore of critical importance for maintaining the safe use of EMs across all sectors. Current trends in EM research include a drive to develop new materials with decreased sensitivities. While it is relatively straightforward to selectively modify some properties (e.g. environmental impact), very little is understood about what constitutes a sensitive material. At present, a new EM must be synthesised and its sensitivity tested. However, with no a priori knowledge of the potential sensitivity of a novel EM, synthesis is accompanied by substantial hazard, as well as time and financial costs. It is therefore pressing to develop a fundamental understanding of what dictates a sensitive material, and hence develop a mechanism to predict these properties. A particularly promising model to explore impact sensitivity of EMs is based on vibrational up-pumping, i.e. the up-conversion of vibrational energy. This thesis explores the application of this model to a set of azide, organic molecular and polymorphic materials. Azide-based EMs share the common N3− explosophore. The electronic structure of this anion was followed as a function of its normal modes of vibration. It was found that excitation of the bending mode is sufficient to induce athermal electronic excitation of the molecule, and spontaneous decomposition. This is valid both in the gas and solid states. It is therefore suggested that this vibrational mode is largely responsible for decomposition of the azide materials. Based on calculations of the complete phonon dispersion curves, the various pathways to vibrational energy up-pumping were explored, namely via overtone and combination pathways. In particular, the relative rates of up-pumping into the N3 − bending mode were investigated. Remarkable agreement is found between these up-pumping rates and the relative ordering of the impact sensitivity of these azides. The calculated vibrational structures of organic molecular EMs were first compared with experimental inelastic neutron scattering spectra and found to provide accurate representation of the low temperature vibrational structure of these complex crystals. The decomposition pathways for organic EMs are not known and hence no target frequency could be unambiguously identified. Instead, the up-pumping model was developed for these materials by investigating the total rate of energy conversion into the internal vibrational manifold. A number of qualitative trends were identified, which may provide a mechanism for the rapid classification of EMs from limited vibrational information. The overtone pathways were found to offer a good agreement with experimental impact sensitivities of these compounds. However, the increased complexity of the vibrational structure of the organic EMs as compared to the azides required a more thorough treatment of the up-pumping mechanism to correctly reflect experimental sensitivities. The effects of temperature on up-pumping were also explored. The sensitivity of organic EMs is known to differ across polymorphic forms. Most notable are the HMX polymorphs. The calculated vibrational structure of two HMX polymorphs was confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy. The up-pumping model developed for molecular organic EMs was therefore extended to a comparison of these two HMX polymorphs. The polymorphic forms of FOX-7 were also investigated under the premise of the up-pumping model. Upon heating, FOX-7 undergoes two polymorphic transformations, which increases the layering of the materials. It therefore offered an opportunity to explore the widely-held hypothesis that layered materials are less sensitive than non-layered materials. The metastable γ-form was successfully recovered, and its experimental impact sensitivity investigated by BAM drop-hammer method. However, upon impact, the γ- polymorph appeared to convert to the α-form and initiate at the same input energy. Hence a considerable deficiency of experimental methods is identified when studying polymorphic materials. FOX-7 was therefore explored within the framework of the up-pumping model. The inelastic neutron scattering spectrum was collected for γ-FOX-7, which confirmed the calculated vibrational structure. It was shown that within the up-pumping model, the layered γ-polymorph is predicted to be less sensitive than the α-form, and results from a decrease in the maximum phonon-bath frequency. Hence a new mechanism is proposed to describe the insensitivity of layered compounds. The work presented in this thesis explores the applications of vibrational up-pumping to rationalise and predict the relative impact sensitivities of a range of EMs. Despite the approximations employed in construction of the model, it leads to excellent correlation with experimental results in all cases. This work therefore opens the door to a new fully ab initio approach to designing new EMs based solely on knowledge of the solid-state structure.",2019
Development of spectral interferometry for shock characterization in energetic materials,"Ultrafast laser diagnostics have opened new pathways for investigation of shock physics and initiation of energetic materials. Short laser pulses on the time scale of 100s of picoseconds can be utilized for direct laser drive and coupled with imaging, spectroscopic, and interferometric tools at femtosecond scales for studies of dynamic loading during shock transit. At Sandia National Laboratories, we are implementing diagnostic platforms which extend the recent development of Ultrafast Shock Interrogation (USI) by Armstrong et al. [1] for table top measurement of Hugoniot/Equation-of-state data and characterization of shock structure with micron spatial resolution and picosecond time resolution. We present bare aluminium ablator data and initial data for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) as well as describe our experimental setup.",2014
Modeling the Microstructure of Energetic Materials with Realistic Constituent Morphology,"In this article, we present a strategy for packing realistic crystals, critical for mesoscale simulations, and predictions. The current packing code uses a dynamic algorithm, with crystal shapes represented by level sets, to create appropriate packs of the microstructure for an energetic material. Crystal shapes include the nitramines HMX, RDX, PETN, and CL20. Two series of packs are considered: a bidisperse pack with size ratio 1:0.3 and a polydisperse pack. We also construct equivalent packs of spheres for comparison purposes. Higher-order statistics are computed and compared. We show that the second-order statistics are essentially independent of particle shape when the packing fraction is held constant. The second-order statistics do, however, depend on the polydispersity.",2011
Multiscale modeling of shock wave localization in porous energetic material,"Shock wave interactions with defects, such as pores, are known to play a key role in the chemical initiation of energetic materials. The shock response of hexanitrostilbene is studied through a combination of large-scale reactive molecular dynamics and mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. In order to extend our simulation capability at themesoscale to include weak shock conditions (<6 GPa), atomistic simulations of pore collapse are used to define a strain-rate-dependent strength model. Comparing these simulation methods allows us to impose physically reasonable constraints on the mesoscale model parameters. In doing so, we have been able to study shock waves interacting with pores as a function of this viscoplastic material response. We find that the pore collapse behavior of weak shocks is characteristically different than that of strong shocks.",2018
High pressure study of hydrogen-bonded energetic material 4-nitropyrazole,"The study investigates the structural stability of the hydrogen-bonded energetic material 4-nitropyrazole (4-NP, C3H3N3O2) from ambient pressure to 10 GPa at room temperature using diamond anvil cell (DAC) and Raman spectroscopy. Based on the changes observed in the high-pressure Raman spectra, it is proposed that the hydrogen-bonded energetic material 4-NP undergoes a phase transition within the pressure range of 2.7-6.4 GPa. Upon complete pressure release from 10 GPa, the resulting spectrum is consistent with the Raman spectrum observed under ambient pressure, indicating that the phase transition is reversible. Ab initio calculations were used to explain the changes in molecular arrangements and hydrogen-bonded networks. Hirshfeld surfaces and fingerprint plots were used to directly compare the variations in packing patterns and intermolecular interactions. Based on the experimental and calculated results, it is proposed that the phase transition of 4-NP was likely caused by the rearrangements of the hydrogen-bonded networks.",2024
High-Contrast Material Identification by Energetic Multiparticle Spectroscopic Transmission Radiography,"Transmission radiography using megaelectronvolt radiation is a powerful nondestructive method for determining elemental composition. Radiography is typically performed with either neutrons or photons, but neither of these probes is universally applicable. We experimentally demonstrate that a significant increase in the contrast for small elemental variations in object composition can be realized by combining the multiple-monoenergetic-neutron and multiple-monoenergetic-photon transmission radiography techniques. The multimodal source is based on deuteron-driven low-energy nuclear reactions that produce both neutrons and photons at discrete energies. The neutron time-of-flight technique is used to measure the transmission over a broad range of neutron energies and is combined with spectroscopic photon transmission radiography. This work demonstrates the use of a single, multiparticle, multiple-monoenergeticradiation source and a single type of radiation detector to simultaneously perform neutron and photon spectroscopic radiography. Four different material-identification metrics are used, which show a factor-of-3-or-greater increase in sensitivity to changes in material composition when compared with traditional dualenergy photon radiography, and are in agreement with simulations that establish a direct correspondence to known photon and neutron interaction cross sections. Furthermore, the ability to infer the presence of objects consisting of impure elements, layers of different elements, or non-natural isotope concentrations is demonstrated.",2019
Coating Processes Towards Selective Laser Sintering of Energetic Material Composites,"This research aims to contribute to the safe methodology for additive manufacturing (AM) of energetic materials. Coating formulation processes were investigated to find a suitable method that may enable selective laser sintering (SLS) as the safe method for fabrication of high explosive (HE) compositions. For safety and convenience reasons, the concept demonstration was conducted using inert explosive simulants with properties quasi-similar to the real HE. Coating processes for simulant RDX-based microparticles by means of PCL and 3,4,5- trimethoxybenzaldehyde (as TNT simulant) are reported. These processes were evaluated for uniformity of coating the HE inert simulant particles with binder materials to facilitate the SLS as the adequate binding and fabrication method. The critical constraints being the coating effectiveness required, spherical particle morphology, micron size range (>20 µm) and a good powder deposition and flow, and performance under SLS to make the method applicable for HEs. Of the coating processes investigated, suspension system and single emulsion methods gave required particle near spherical morphology, size and uniform coating. The suspension process appears to be suitable for the SLS of HE mocks and potential formulation methods for active HE composites. The density was estimated to be comparable with the current HE compositions and plastic bonded explosives (PBXs) such as C4 and PE4, produced from traditional methods. The formulation method developed and the understanding of the science behind the processes paves the way toward safe SLS of the active HE compositions and may open avenues for further research and development of munitions of the future.",2019
The Reactivity of Energetic Materials Under High Pressure and Temperature,"Chemical transformations that occur at the reactive shock front of energetic materials determine many aspects of material properties and performance. One major shortcoming of current explosive models is the lack of chemical kinetics data of the reacting explosive at the high pressures and, temperatures experienced under detonation conditions. In the absence of experimental data, long time-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with reactive chemistry provide insight into the decomposition mechanisms of explosives and allow us to obtain effective reaction rates. These rates can then be incorporated into a thermochemical continuum code for accurate and predictive description of grain- and continuum-scale dynamics of reacting explosives. During the course of the past decade, we have examined the chemistry of several reacting explosive materials, such as the high-performing HMX and the very insensitive TATB explosives, both of which are organic molecular solids at ambient conditions. We have used quantum-based, self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method to calculate the interatomic forces in molecular dynamics simulations either for thermal decomposition studies (constant volume temperature) or dynamical shock studies using the multiscale shock simulation technique (MSST). These studies allow us to investigate the chemical reactivity of explosives and to examine electronic properties at extreme conditions of temperature and pressure for a relatively long timescale on the order of several hundreds of picoseconds. In this chapter, we discuss challenges in simulating the reactions of shocked energetic materials and review specific examples of our recent simulations on HMX, PETN, and shocked TATB. Each of these studies revealed interesting aspects associated with known macroscopic properties of these materials. We also discuss simulations on nonenergetic materials such as shocked carbon and methane.",2014
"Calculation of Combustion, Explosion and Detonation Characteristics of Energetic Materials","In this work, the thermodynamic code for the determination of the chemical equilibrium composition of a non-ideal heterogeneous system is presented.

"Preparation, Characterization and Application of Nano-Graphene-Based Energetic Materials","Nano-graphene-based energetic materials, as a new type of composite energetic materials such as desensitizer and combustion catalyst, have attracted extensive attention from energetic researchers. In this paper, the preparation of nano-graphene-based energetic materials, the desensitization effect of nano-graphene-based on energetic compounds, the thermal decomposition and combustion behavior of the materials are reviewed. Meanwhile, the existing problems and future development of nano-graphene-based energetic compounds are discussed.",2021
Micro to mesoscale temperature gradients in microwave heated energetic materials,"Temperature gradients will appear in any microwave-heated heterogeneous system where there is contrast in the complex permittivity of the constituent materials. The magnitude of the gradients depends on several factors that include the permittivity, thermal conductivity, length scale, and thermal diffusivity. In general, it is challenging to measure the absolute temperature accurately in a strong microwave field; the presence of large gradients can further complicate the interpretation of temperature measurements. These issues are especially important during the microwave heating of highly exothermic chemical reaction systems, such as those containing explosives or propellants. It was therefore the intent of this work to theoretically and numerically investigate the nature of microwave-induced thermal gradients in energetic systems over a wide range of length scales, primarily for the purpose of interpreting temperature measurement.

Tuning Energetic Material Reactivity Using Surface Functionalization of Aluminum Fuels,"Combustion analysis of three different thermites consisting of aluminum (Al) particles with and without surface functionalization combined with molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was performed to study the effect of surface functionalization on flame propagation velocity (FPV). Two types of Al particles had self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of perfluoro tetradecanoic (PFTD) and perfluoro sebacic (PFS) acids around the alumina shell, respectively; the other one did not. Flame speeds for Al with PFTD acid combined with MoO3 are 86% higher than Al/MoO3 whereas those for Al with PFS acid combined with MoO3 are almost half of Al/MoO3. The Al-PFTD structure is more sterically hindered and exhibits lower bond dissociation energy. This chemistry promotes increased flame speeds. Thermal equilibrium studies were performed using a differential scanning calorimeter and a thermogravimetric analyzer to determine activation energy (E-a) of the thermites. Results are consistent with flame speed observations and showed an inverse relationship between flame speed and E-a. This study shows that Surface functionalization can be used as an approach to control the reactivity of Al particles.",2012
Development of Highly Active Titania-Based Nanoparticles for Energetic Materials,"Recent advances in nanostructured fuels and oxidizers may lead to high-performance energetic materials for propulsion, but these nanoparticulates present serious challenges due to their inherent instability and safety hazards and difficulty of manufacture. In this paper, we develop an alternate route, the use of nanoscale metal-oxides to catalyze reactions between micrometer-scale energetic constituents. Methods to synthesize TiO(2)-based nanoparticles that are highly active toward energetic reactions and effectively incorporate them into energetic composites are reported. Activity was maximized by tuning the physical and chemical properties of the nano-TiO(2) dispersion in the composite. An 81% increase in combustion rate was achieved with a nanoparticle loading of 1 wt %, making energetically active nano-TiO(2) a viable material for advanced propulsion, without the hazards and difficulties of competing technologies.",2011
Computational Modeling of Energetic Materials Under Impact and Shock Compression,"Understanding the fundamental physics involved in the high strain rate deformation of high explosives (HE) is critical for developing more efficient, reliable, and safer energetic materials. When HE are impacted at high velocities, several thermo-mechanical processes are activated, which are responsible for the ignition of these materials. These processes occur at different time and length scales, some of them inaccessible by experimentation. Therefore, computational modeling is an excellent alternative to study multiscale phenomena responsible for the ignition and initiation of HE. This thesis aims to develop a continuum model of β -HMX to study the anisotropic behavior of HE at the mesoscale, including fracture evolution and plastic deformation. This thesis focus on three types of simulations. First, we investigate dynamic fracture and hotspot formation in β -HMX particles embedded in Sylgard binder undergoing high strain rate compression and harmonic excitation. We use the phase field damage model (PFDM) to simulate dynamic fracture. Also, we implement a thermal model to capture temperature increase due to fracture dissipation and friction at both cracks and debonded HMX/Sylgard interface. In our simulations, we observe that crack patterns are strongly dominated by initial defects such as pre-existing cracks and interface debonding. Regions with initial debonding between HMX particles and the polymer are critical sites where cracks nucleate and propagate. Heating due to friction generates in these regions too and caused the formation of critical hotspots. We also run simulations of a β -HMX particle under high-frequency harmonic excitation. As expected, higher frequencies and larger amplitudes lead to an increase in the damage growth rate. The simulations suggest that the intensity of the thermal localization can be controlled more readily by modifying the bonding properties between the particle and the binder rather than reducing the content of bulk defects in the particle. Second, we present simulations of shock compression in β -HMX single crystals. For this purpose, we implemented a constitutive model that simulates the elastoplastic anisotropic response of this type of material. The continuum model includes a rate-dependent crystal plasticity model and the Mie-Grüneisen equation of state to obtain the pressure due to shock. Temperature evolves in the material due to plastic dissipation, shock, and thermoelastic coupling. The model is calibrated with non-reactive atomistic simulations to make sure the model obeys the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We compare finite element (FE) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to study the formation of hot spots during the collapse of nano-size void in a β -HMX energetic crystal. The FE simulations captured the transition from viscoelastic collapse for relatively weak shocks to a hydrodynamic regime for strong shocks. The overall temperature distributions and the rate of pore collapse are similar to MD simulations. We observe that the void collapse rate and temperature field are strongly dependent on the plasticity model, and we quantify these effects. We also studied the collapse of a micron size void in HMX impacted at different crystal orientations and impact velocities. The simulation results of void collapse are in good agreement with a gas gun void collapse experiment. While the void size and crystal orientation do not affect the area ratio rate, they strongly affect the void collapse regime and temperature.",2021
Plasma surface treatment of aluminum nanoparticles for energetic material applications,"Aluminum nanoparticles (nAl) have great potential for energetic applications. However, the native oxide shell (amorphous alumina, Al2O3) inhibits efficient energy release and acts as a barrier for aluminum (Al) oxidation. An energetic oxidizer, aluminum iodate hexahydrate (AIH), has recently been demonstrated as an effective coating for nAl. However, the current chemical synthesis method has led to widely varying AIH concentrations on nAl particles. Plasma surface treatment of nAl is a novel ""energy coupled to material"" technique which alters the nAl surface properties without changing the bulk active Al core. This work explores a new approach to engineering the nAl surface using atmospheric argon (Ar) plasma to accomplish two objectives: (1) reduce the nAl oxide shell thickness, and (2) synthesize AIH on the treated particle surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals more than 40% reduction in the oxide thickness after 10min Ar plasma treatment. Laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) experiments show significant energy release enhancements for the plasma-treated nAl with AIH coating (UT-nAl-AIH) compared to commercial nAl as well as untreated nAl with AIH coating (UT-nAl-AIH). The results demonstrate the potential of applying atmospheric plasma techniques to modify nAl for enhanced reactivity. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.",2019
High-Precision Density Measurements of Energetic Materials for Quality Assessment,"Even though helium pycnometry is considered a very precise method of density determination, its use to analyse factors influencing crystal quality (e. g. solvent inclusions, amorphous states, crystal defects horizontal ellipsis ) is limited due to the unknown inherent accuracy of the method. Previous studies have attempted to identify the best possible accuracy of helium pycnometry. However, no robust method has been proposed to validate even the precision obtained. This means that the often occurring, seemingly random density deviations have never been satisfactorily explained. In this study the influencing factors on density measurements of the CL-20/HMX cocrystal and phase stabilised ammonium nitrate carried out with an AccuPyc 1340 TEC were quantified and a robust method of data analysis was developed to judge with certainty the quality and significance of the data obtained. This study shows that statistical tests such as the t-test and ANOVA cannot be utilised to differentiate between samples or repeat measurements, even though the density data points exhibit a normal distribution. By utilising confidence intervals and quantifying the three major sources of error (sampling error, change in barometric pressure during the measurement, and weight in error), a repeatability of 0.015 % was achieved and a method was developed that enables differentiation between samples with a certainty as good as 0.05 %.",2021
Speciation of energetic materials on a microcantilever using surface reduction,"Although microcantilevers have been used to detect explosives with extremely high sensitivity using variations in adsorption-induced bending and resonance frequency, obtaining selectivity remains a challenge. Reversible chemoselectivity at ambient temperatures based on receptor-based detection provides only limited selectivity due to the generality of chemical interactions. The oxygen imbalance in secondary explosives presents a means to achieve receptor-free speciation of explosives using surface reduction of adsorbed molecules. We demonstrate highly selective and realtime detection of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) using a copper oxide-coated cantilever with a surface reduction approach. Not only can this technique exclusively differentiate explosives from nonexplosives, but also it has the potential to specify individual explosives such as TNT, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and RDX. This technique together with receptor-based detection techniques provides a multimodal approach for achieving very high selectivity.",2008
Two-brightness-amplifier imaging system for energetic-materials-combustion study,"This paper discusses a laser monitor with two channels for acquiring images synchronized in time and its use for visualizing the surface of metal nanopowders during combustion. Each channel is an independent optical system based on a copper bromide vapor brightness amplifier and a high-speed camera that allows visualizing a specified area of the sample. Thus, the laser monitor allows real-time imaging of the same sample area with different spatial resolutions and simultaneously two areas of the sample. In comparison with the ""master oscillator-power amplifier"" system and a bistatic laser monitor in the proposed system, the radiation pulses of the brightness amplifiers are synchronized in such a way that the inversion in the active media is formed at different time intervals. Such a system makes it possible to register processes in one area of the sample in the mode of double frames with a time shift of 35 ns. As an additional option in the proposed system, it is possible to implement a laser illumination mode in which an additional camera is used with a narrow-band filter installed on it for the emission wavelength of brightness amplifiers, and the same radiation from the brightness amplifier is used as an illuminating light source. The proposed technique was used to visualize the combustion of aluminum nanopowders without additives in real time in the area of laser initiation with different spatial resolutions and nanoAl + microAl + microFe powder mixtures in the laser ignition area and the adjacent area of the sample simultaneously as the combustion wave propagates.

Synthesis and Application of Titanium Aminotetrazole in Energetic Material Formulations,"Over the past decade metal complexed aminotetrazoles have been studied for the production of high surface area metal and metal oxide foams. In this work, Ti-complexed aminotetrazole (Ti-AT) is synthesized and considered for inclusion in energetic formulations to drive TiO 2 formation during a combustion event. Combusted Ti-AT results in mixed phase TiO 2 with surface area as high as 62 m 2 g -1 . Ti-AT is insensitive to friction, ESD, and impact stimuli unless paired with strong oxidizers (or HMX). With further investigation, Ti-AT may serve as an effective material for TiO 2 production during a combustion event and lead to multi-synergistic energetic material formulations that can neutralize chemical warfare agents.",2021
"CL-20-Based Cocrystal Energetic Materials: Simulation, Preparation and Performance","The cocrystallization of high-energy explosives has attracted great interests since it can alleviate to a certain extent the power-safety contradiction. 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaaza-isowurtzitane (CL-20), one of the most powerful explosives, has attracted much attention for researchers worldwide. However, the disadvantage of CL-20 has increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and cocrystallization of CL-20 with other compounds may provide a way to decrease its sensitivity. The intermolecular interaction of five types of CL-20-based cocrystal (CL-20/TNT, CL-20/HMX, CL-20/FOX-7, CL-20/TKX-50 and CL-20/DNB) by using molecular dynamic simulation was reviewed. The preparation methods and thermal decomposition properties of CL-20-based cocrystal are emphatically analyzed. Special emphasis is focused on the improved mechanical performances of CL-20-based cocrystal, which are compared with those of CL-20. The existing problems and challenges for the future work on CL-20-based cocrystal are discussed.",2020
Surface Persistence of Trace Level Deposits of Highly Energetic Materials,"In the fields of Security and Defense, explosive traces must be analyzed at the sites of the terrorist events. The persistence on surfaces of these traces depends on the sublimation processes and the interactions with the surfaces. This study presents evidence that the sublimation process of these traces on stainless steel (SS) surfaces is very different than in bulk quantities. The enthalpies of sublimation of traces of four highly energetic materials: triacetone triperoxide (TATP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 1,3,5- trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) deposited on SS substrates were determined by optical fiber coupled-grazing angle probe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. These were compared with enthalpies of sublimation determined by thermal gravimetric analysis for bulk amounts and differences between them were found. The sublimation enthalpy of RDX was very different for traces than for bulk quantities, attributed to two main factors. First, the beta-RDX phase was present at trace levels, unlike the case of bulk amounts which consisted only of the alpha-RDX phase. Second, an interaction between the RDX and SS was found. This interaction energy was determined using grazing angle FTIR microscopy. In the case of DNT and TNT, bulk and traces enthalpies were statistically similar, but it is evidenced that at the level of traces a metastable phase was observed. Finally, for TATP the enthalpies were statistically identical, but a non-linear behavior and a change of heat capacity values different from zero was found for both trace and bulk phases.",2019
Theoretical study of the microscopic Doppler effect for energetic material,"We develop a physical model to describe the microscopic Doppler effect of phonon states in energetic material and use it to investigate the phonon-strain scattering behaviour of beta-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine. The required elastic constants and force constants are obtained by first-principles calculations. By using the phonon-strain scattering probability, a set of dissipation parameters are calculated, such as the viscosity coefficient, damping rate of elastic wave, and heat dissipation across shock wave front. It is interesting that the Doppler effect could describe the microscopic phonon scattering mechanism reasonably.",2019
"Nitro-Substituted Bishomocubanes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application as Energetic Materials","Several high-energy-density strained polycyclic compounds nitromethyl-l,3-bishomocubane (NMBHC), nitromethylene-1,3-bishomocubane (NMyBHC), and bis(nitromethyl)-1,3-bishomocubane (DNTMBHC), which were synthesized for the first time from bishomocubanone, hold potential for application as standalone fuels in liquid bipropellant systems or as additives in liquid and solid propellant formulations. DFT analysis at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory was employed to optimize the geometries of the compounds and to determine their densities, heats of formation, and various thermodynamic properties. The density specific impulse, determined by using equilibrium thermodynamics, demonstrated an improvement of 75s for NMBHC and NMyBHC over standard hydrocarbons. The specific impulse with ammonium perchlorate showed an improvement of 25-30s over hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that NMBHC, NMyBHC, and DNTMBHC evaporated readily with activation energies of 58.8, 69.2, and 74.5kJmol(-1), respectively.",2014
Anisotropic behavior of energetic materials at elevated pressure and temperature,"First principles and molecular dynamics methods where used to study energetic materials (EM) of varying sensitivity, particularly nitromethane (NM) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Molecular and electronic structure, as well as anisotropic elastic properties, variation of charge distributions, and stress-strain behavior of these three materials were investigated. Information obtained from different levels of theory is useful to reveal and assess the anisotropic sensitivity of the studied systems. For NM, we observe a crystallographic phase transformation and a drastic change in its mechanical behavior. PETN is observed to be mechanically stable within the studied pressure range, with a marked anisotropic behavior when compressed at elevated temperatures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthesis and characterization of energetic materials from sodium azide,"A tetrazole is a 5-membered ring containing 4 nitrogens and 1 carbon. Due to its energetic potential and structural similarity to carboxylic acids, this ring system has a wide number of applications. In this thesis, a new and safe sustainable process to produce tetrazoles was designed that acheived high yields under mild conditions. Also, a technique was developed to form a trityl-protected tetrazole in situ . The rest of this work involved the exploitation of the energetic potential of tetrazoles. This moiety was successfully applied in polymers, ionic liquids, foams, and gels. The overall results from these experiments illustrate the fact that tetrazoles have the potential to serve as a stable alternative to the troublesome azido group common in many energetic materials. Due to these applications, the tetrazole moiety is a very important entity.",2004
Charge-density studies of energetic materials: CL-20 and FOX-7,"Experimental electron densities and derived properties have been determined for the two energetic materials CL-20 (3,5,9,11-tetraacetyl-14-oxo-1,3,5,7,9,11-hexaazapentacyclo-[5.5.3.02,6.04,10.08,12]pentadecane), and FOX-7 (1,1-diamino- 2,2-dinitroethylene) from single-crystal diffraction. Synchrotron data extending to high scattering angles were measured at low temperature. Low figures-of-merit and excellent residuals were obtained. The Hansen & Coppens multipole-model electron density was compared with results from theoretical calculations via structure factors simulating an experiment. Chemical bonding in the molecules is discussed and a topological analysis gives insight especially into the character of those bonds that are thought to play a key role in the decomposition of the molecules. A comparison of theoretical and experimental electrostatic potentials shows no obvious evidence supporting earlier findings on other nitroheterocyclic molecules that electron-density maxima near the C-NO2 bonds mapped on the electron-density isosurface can be correlated with impact sensitivities. For FOX-7 periodic Hartree-Fock calculations were performed to investigate the influence of the crystal field on the electron density distribution.",2008
A model for hot spot formation in shocked energetic materials,"Shock initiation and detonation are often attributed to wave interactions in the micro-structure of condensed materials, which involve complex thermo-chemical, fluid and structural processes. Due to their broad range of scales, the simulation of hot spot formation, reaction growth, and transition to detonation is therefore rendered challenging. The extension of these complex couplings to simulate full-scale tests is prohibitively costly. This paper introduces a hot spot formation model to account for heterogeneous effects based on physical and chemical properties. The formulation is first evaluated in a HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) sample where hot spots are known to form due to void collapses. Transition to detonation is achieved with impact pressures that match those found in experiments. Parametric studies are performed to determine the effects of the void size and population on the sensitivity of the material. Then, the same hot spot model is used to study detonation in nanocrystalline PETN (pentaerythritol-tetranitrate) where heating is primarily the result of grain boundary effects such as friction, plasticity, and deformation. The inclusion of the hot spot model increases the sensitivity of the material and predicts shock pressures, again similar to experimental values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the results is performed to assess the uncertainty in the input variables of the model and to identify the critical parameters with implications on the accuracy of the results.

Electrostatic discharge sensitivity and electrical conductivity of composite energetic materials,"Composite energetic material response to electrical stimuli was investigated and a correlation between electrical conductivity and ignition sensitivity was examined. The composites consisted of micrometer particle aluminum combined with another metal, metal oxide, or fluoropolymer. Of the nine tested mixtures, aluminum (Al) with copper oxide (CuO) was the only mixture to ignite by electrostatic discharge. Under the loose powder conditions of these experiments, the Al-CuO minimum ignition energy (MIE) is 25 mJ and exhibited an electrical conductivity two orders of magnitude higher than the next composite. This study showed a similar trend in MIE. for ignition triggered by a discharged spark compared with a thermal hot wire source. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013
Modeling and process optimization of nano-modified simulant energetic materials,"Nanofibers were added to simulant energetic materials via twin screw extrusion (TSE) in an effort to characterize the degree of dispersion of the fibers into a highly filled polymer composition used in the production of solid gun propellants. This work was an attempt to optimize process conditions, such as, screw speed and feed rate that will result in maximum dispersion with minimal breakage of the fibers. Simulant material properties including density, Shore A hardness, and resilience were determined. Values of specific heat capacity, obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), were used to predict a theoretical melt temperature during TSE via an energy balance equation. The thermal diffusivities of the model polymer and filler were determined by the dynamic cooling of a cylindrical sample. An energy balance was performed and predicted values for the melt temperature (124°C) and the energy supplied to the melt during twin screw extrusion (3641 J/min). The specific energy was calculated for all twin screw extrusion trials. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",2004
Metabolically activated energetic materials mediate cellular anabolism for bone regeneration.,"The understanding of cellular energy metabolism activation by engineered scaffolds remains limited, posing challenges for therapeutic applications in tissue regeneration. This study presents biosynthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB-co-4HB)] and its major degradation product, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), as endogenous bioenergetic fuels that augment cellular anabolism, thereby facilitating the progression of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) towards osteoblastogenesis. Our research demonstrated that 3HB markedly boosts in vitro ATP production, elevating mitochondrial membrane potential and capillary-like tube formation. Additionally, it raises citrate levels in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, facilitating the synthesis of citrate-containing apatite during hBMSCs osteogenesis. Furthermore, 3HB administration significantly increased bone mass in rats with osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy. The findings also showed that P(3HB-co-4HB) scaffold substantially enhances long-term vascularized bone regeneration in rat cranial defect models. These findings reveal a previously unknown role of 3HB in promoting osteogenesis of hBMSCs and highlight the metabolic activation of P(3HB-co-4HB) scaffold for bone regeneration.

Equation of state for the detonation products of energetic materials,"Energetic materials (EMs) are one of the necessities in many military and civilian applications. Measuring the thermodynamic behaviors of detonation products of EMs at high temperature and high pressure, their equations of state (EOSs) not only serve as a basis in the design of novel materials, but also provide valuable information for their practical applications. The EOS study has a long history, but keeps moving all the time. Various EMs have been developed, the EOS of detonation products provides abundant information in the thermochemistry, hydromechanics and detonation physics, which in turn feedbacks the development of novel EMs and their EOSs. With the development of experimental techniques and computer simulations, many EOSs have been proposed for various explosives in recent years. While experiments keep their fundamental roles, integrated theory-experiment study has become the main approach to the EOS establishment for novel EMs. Moreover, computer simulations based on interatomic and/or intermolecular interaction will have great potential in the future when big data and artificial intelligence are introduced into the field.",2021
Chemical equilibrium analysis of energetic materials using Particle Swarm Optimization,"A novel method for the determination of chemical equilibrium for detonation products under extreme pressure and temperature conditions is presented. A stochastic algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is developed for calculating the minimum Gibbs free energy of the system and thereby estimating the equilibrium composition of the product species. The aforementioned PSO algorithm is compared with an existing algorithm based on the Monte Carlo approach. The results indicate that the PSO algorithm fetches better results than the Monte Carlo algorithm in terms of accuracy and computational time. The constraints in the PSO method are handled with a novel method, unlike the conventional method involving penalty functions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020

Numerical modeling of the thermal expansion of an energetic material,"The thermoelastic response of a TATB-based pressed explosive is studied using morphological modeling and a numerical Fourier scheme. First, we characterize the polycrystalline-like microstructure in terms of the (2D) granulometry and covariance functions, measured on SEM micrograph images. The granulometry is found to be close to a Rayleigh distribution. Second, we represent the polycrystal by a modified Johnson-Mehl tessellation with time-varying germination-rate, in order to approach the wide size distribution observed on the SEM images. We find excellent agreement between the numerically optimized model and the real material in terms of granulometry. Third, we compute the thermoelastic response of the microstructure model by means of full-field Fourier-based computations. Each crystal is assigned uncorrelated random orientations. The thermomechanical response of single crystals is provided by the molecular dynamic simulations of Bedrov et al. (2009) and the X-ray diffraction results of Kolb et al. (1979). Macroscopic (uniform) temperature or strain loadings are applied along various directions (tension, shear or hydrostatic). We observe strong internal stresses upon heating, owing to the highly anisotropic thermoelastic response of TATB and random crystallographic orientations in the polycrystal. The largest stress and strain gradients are observed at grain boundaries, enforcing the idea that grain boundary fracture is indeed the irreversible mechanism underlying ratchet growth. As a first attempt to account for the plastic binder, a 4-voxels soft interphase is inserted at grain boundaries. This results in a strong softening effect on elastic macroscopic properties.

Touching the density limits of energetic materials by molecular design,"In this study, we designed a novel class of caged energetic compounds that integrate the high cage strain characteristics of cubane with the high nitrogen content of isowurtzitane, along with modified nitro explosive groups, to achieve high energy density. Among the designed compounds, CEM-3 demonstrates a molecular density of 2.03 g cm-3, accompanied by a detonation velocity and a detonation pressure of 9660 m s-1 and 44.4 GPa, respectively, and its detonation properties are comparable to those of HNIW. CEM-4 possesses a molecular density of 2.08 g cm-3, with a detonation velocity and a detonation pressure of 9884 m s-1 and 47.1 GPa, respectively. Its detonation performance surpasses that of both HNIW and ONC, while its safety performance (evaluated by h50) also outperforms that of HNIW and ONC. CEM-5 achieves a molecular density of 2.14 g cm-3, which approaches the density limits of the energetic compounds within the CHNO class. We have designed a new type of caged energetic materials whose energy and safety properties have been determined using theoretical calculations.",2023
Thermochemical analysis of improvised energetic materials by laser-heating calorimetry,"Thermochemical analysis of six improvised energetic materials was carried out using laser-heating calorimetry to demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology to provide distinctive thermal signatures and information on the material shelf life. The chemicals evaluated were erythritol tetranitrate, hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), poor-man's C-4 (blend of potassium chlorate and petroleum jelly), R-salt (represented by 1,3,5-trini-troso-1,3,5-triazinane), triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and urea nitrate. The measurement technique records the temperature rise with time, from which one can estimate the material endothermic/exothermic behavior, energy release rate, and total specific energy release (heating value, enthalpy of explosion), as well as the sample mass rate of change. Measurements were carried out in an inert nitrogen environment at laser heating rates up to 60 K/s with steady-state temperatures reaching about 933 K. Sample initial mass was between 1.0 mg and 4.0 mg. Experiments were carried out with freshly prepared samples, as well as refrigerated samples and those stored at room (laboratory) temperature for three years. Results indicated that the samples reacted rapidly between 0.50 s and 0.75 s, being initiated near the material decomposition temperature. The total specific energy release, using two different thermal-analysis models, was calculated and compared to values available in the literature. One model represents sample reaction and decomposition within the spherical reactor volume, while the second represents reactions emanating from sample in a pan centrally positioned within the sphere; the former model was found to be the more appropriate approach for these faster-reacting energetic materials. The thermal sig-natures (temperature-time derivatives with temperature) were different for each chemical, a feature that may be important for energetic material identification. The initiation and peak reaction temperatures were found to decrease with increasing initial sample mass. Also, the shelf life for TATP and HMTD was found not to degrade under nonideal conditions after three years.",2022
Ultra-High Fidelity Laser-Induced Air Shock from Energetic Materials,"Recent interest in the implementation of the Laser-induced Air Shock from Energetic Materials (LASEM) technique prompted an investigation using ultra-high-speed imaging diagnostics to provide early-time (sub-mu s) shock-wave-radius-versus-time data necessary to accurately determine the characteristic laser-induced-shock velocity (y-intercept) for high explosives (HE) of interest. Ultra-high-speed focused-shadowgraphy images were collected from nanosecond-pulsed laser-ablated samples of HE similar to those in the published literature. Shadowgraphy images were collected using interframe times ranging from 50-750 ns, with exposure times of 5 ns. Acquired shock-wave-radius-versus-time data permitted a high-fidelity assessment of the shock wave velocity produced at the characteristic radius of the generated laser-plasma pulse. The resulting data from eight different HE indicated that early-time energy contributions and the resulting laser-induced shock velocity profiles produced from ablation of the HE material were indistinguishable amongst the explosives tested for the majority of the time domain characterized (0-12 mu s).",2020
Preparation and Characterization of Porous Carbon/RDX Nanocomposite Energetic Materials,"A novel energetic material was fabricated by filling porous carbon with 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) via the ultrasonic stirring method. Characterization (TEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, etc.) was performed to determine the micromorphology, crystal structure, and specific surface area. TEM images indicated that the RDX particles were homogeneously distributed in the channels of the porous carbon, FTIR spectra and the XRD curve of the C/RDX composite exhibited the combined characteristics of porous carbon and RDX. The BET test data also confirmed this situation. The thermal decomposition kinetics and thermodynamics of the C/RDX nanocomposite energetic material were investigated at various heating rates (5, 10, 15, and 20 K center dot min-1). The test results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature and the critical temperature of thermal explosion were lower than for RDX alone by 46.8 and 40.69 celcius, respectively. The activation energy of the C/RDX composite was lower than those of raw RDX and a C/RDX physical mixture, indicating that the C/RDX composite exhibited high thermolysis activity.",2023
Salts of Picramic Acid - Nearly Forgotten Temperature-Resistant Energetic Materials,"Thermally stable explosives are becoming more and more important nowadays due to their important role in the oil and mining industry. The requirements of these explosives are constantly changing. Picramate-based compounds are poorly investigated towards their energetic properties as well as sensitivities. In this work, 13 different salts of picramic acid were synthesized as potential energetic materials with high thermal stability in a simple one-step reaction and compared with commercially used lead picramate. The obtained compounds were extensively characterized by e. g. XRD, IR, EA, DTA, and TGA. In addition, the sensitivities towards impact and friction were determined with the BAM drop hammer and the BAM friction tester. Also, the electrostatic discharge sensitivity was explored. Calculations of the energetic performance of selected compounds were carried out with the current version of EXPLO5 code. Therefore, heats of formation were computed and X-ray densities were converted to room temperature. Some of the synthesized salts show promising characteristics with high exothermic decomposition temperatures. Especially, the water-free rubidium, cesium, and barium salts 5, 6 and 10 with decomposition temperatures of almost 300 degrees C could be promising candidates for future applications.",2020
Synthesis and Investigation of Advanced Energetic Materials Based on Bispyrazolylmethanes,"Herein we present the preparation and characterization of three new bispyrazolyl-based energetic compounds with great potential as explosive materials. The reaction of sodium 4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazolate (5) with dimethyl iodide yielded bis(4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazolyl)methane (6), which is a secondary explosive with high heat resistance (T-dec=310 degrees C). The oxidation of this compound afforded bis(3,4,5-trinitropyrazolyl)methane (7), which is a combined nitrogen- and oxygen-rich secondary explosive with very high theoretical and estimated experimental detonation performance (V-det (theor)=9304ms(-1) versus V-det(exp)=9910ms(-1)) in the range of that of CL-20. Also, the thermal stability (T-dec=205 degrees C) and sensitivities of 7 are auspicious. The reaction of 6 with insitu generated nitrous acid yielded the primary explosive bis(4-diazo-5-nitro-3-oxopyrazolyl)methane (8), which showed superior properties to those of currently used diazodinitrophenol (DDNP).",2016
An energetic approach to the analysis of anisotropic hyperelastic materials,"We demonstrate that for the class of anisotropic hyperelastic materials with stiffening behaviour (i.e., the stiffness increases for increasing strain), it is possible to find an approximation by means of the linear superposition of an anisotropic quadratic potential, generated by the true linear elasticity tensor of the target material, and a suitable correction potential that is isotropic and hyperelastic. The proposed method can be implemented into commercially available Finite Element software by use of featured options only. This approach is intended to provide the solution to a stress-strain problem, based entirely on energetic considerations, which ensures the convexity of the potentials, and provides a simple material characterisation procedure.

Azo Pyrazole Carboxylic Derivatives for Potential Energetic Materials,"Ideal energetic materials require high densities, favorable thermal stability, high-energetic characteristics, low sensitivity to impact and friction, and safe environmental compatibility. Moreover, in view of the need for large-scale production, the synthesis routes for energetic materials must be as short as possible. In this study, novel low-sensitivity energetic compounds 5,5 '-(diazene-1,2-diyl)bis(3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile) (4), 1,2-bis(3-carboxy-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)diazene-1-oxide (5), and 5,5 '-(diazene-1,2-diyl)bis(3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) (6) were simply and efficiently synthesized by cycloaddition and nitration reactions. For the sake of exploring their potential as energetic materials, elemental analysis, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction were applied to investigate the properties of such compounds. The calculated detonation properties of 4-6 (7480-8190 m s(-1)) are superior to that of the traditional explosive TNT (6881 m s(-1)). In addition, 4-6 have higher decomposition temperatures (T-d = 212-260 degrees C) than RDX (T-d = 204 degrees C). Meanwhile, 5 and 6 also have lower mechanical sensitivities (IS = 40 J, FS > 360 N) than RDX (IS = 7.5 J, FS = 120 N). The results showed that the azo pyrazole carboxylic acid derivatives could be used as low-sensitivity energetic materials.",2024
Kinetic Experiments and Data-Driven Modeling for Energetic Material Combustion,"Energetic materials (i.e., explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics) have been used for centuries in a wide variety of applications that include celebratory firework displays, the demolition of ‘immovable’ structures, mining resources from the earth’s crust, launching humans into outer space, and propelling munitions across the battlefield. Many different scientific and engineering domains have found unique value in their characteristic release of significant heat and pressure. While the rate at which energetic materials react is often dependent on the source of initiation, surrounding thermodynamic conditions, and formulation sensitivity, many applications aim for a controlled combustion process to produce large amounts of work output – solid and liquid rocket motors and gun-launched projectiles are a few key examples. Other energetic material systems are often inadvertently exposed to thermal insults, which can result in similar combustion behavior. To accurately model these systems, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of the chemical kinetics that control various aspects of the combustion process (e.g., changes in temperature (T), pressure (P), and species mole fractions (X)). Detailed chemical kinetic models are often used to understand and subsequently predict such behavior. Understanding the gas-phase reaction kinetics of energetic materials is essential when trying to predict critical performance parameters such as flame speeds, temperature and pressure profiles, and heat flux between material phases. These parameters can have significant impact on predictions of system-level performance (e.g., the specific impulse of solid rocket motors, propellant burn rates in projectile systems, and munition responses to thermal insult and extended temperature cycling). While the gas-phase reaction kinetics of energetic material combustion were heavily studied from the late 1970’s to the early 2000’s, research efforts beyond this time frame have primarily focused on condensed-phase chemistry as it is thought to be less understood. Over the past two decades, however, there have been significant advances in our understanding of small molecule reactions that have not yet been accounted for in many energetic material models. One such example are chemically termolecular reactions – a new class of phenomenological reactions that have not yet been considered for inclusion in any energetic material kinetic models. Recent studies have indicated that chemically termolecular reactions, mediated through ephemeral collision complexes, have significant impact on the global kinetics of certain combustion systems. This discovery has since prompted the question of which systems are significantly influenced by chemically termolecular reactions and should therefore account for their presence in gas-phase phenomenological models. Although a select number of systems have already been investigated, such as flame speed and ignition delay predictions in common hydrocarbon combustion scenarios, the influence of chemically termolecular reactions on the kinetics of energetic materials has not yet been explored. As an initial investigation into energetic materials, a case study for RDX was performed, for which abundant computational and experimental data are available. To aid in assessing the impact of chemically termolecular reactions, for which almost no data are available, this study leveraged an automated procedure to identify and estimate rate constants for potential chemically termolecular reactions based exclusively on data available for related reactions. Four detailed kinetics models for RDX were independently screened for potential chemically termolecular reactions. Model predictions including these chemically termolecular reactions revealed that they have significant potential impact on profiles of major species, radicals, and temperatures. The analysis pinpointed ∼20-40 chemically termolecular reactions, out of the thousands of possibilities, estimated to have the largest impact. These reactions, including many mediated by ephemeral HNO** and NNH** complexes, are therefore worthwhile candidates for more accurate quantification via master equation calculations. More generally, just as the importance of including chemically termolecular reactions in hydrocarbon combustion models is becoming recognized, the present results show compelling evidence for the need for their inclusion in energetic material models as well. The investigation into chemically termolecular reactions yielded a secondary conclusion based on the observed influence of the small molecule C/H/N/O chemistry on overall predictions of energetic material combustion – updating the small molecule chemistry in RDX models produced significant changes to predictions of major species and temperature, suggesting that the development of a comprehensive gas-phase energetic material combustion model would be of great value and have broad utility as a foundational model for a great variety of C/H/N/O energetic materials. To begin developing such a model, all small molecule chemistry in current kinetic models was reviewed with the intent of identifying a sub-model in need of revisions and subsequently addressing its uncertainties using targeted experiments to improve overall predictions. The ammonia sub-model was selected as it is both highly uncertain and highly influential in many energetic material models. Ammonia (NH 3 ) has garnered substantial attention in recent years due to its importance across many scientific domains – including its potential use as a carbon-free fuel and long-term energy storage option, its use in reducing combustion-generated nitrogen oxide emissions, its role as a decomposition fragment of many energetic materials, and its presence as an important impurity during biofuel and biomass combustion that can affect overall system kinetics, among others. Yet, it is generally recognized that there are still significant gaps in the present understanding of ammonia kinetics -– in both experimental data sets and sub-models within the overall ammonia kinetic mechanism. For example, most experimental studies of ammonia oxidation have used molecular oxygen as the primary or sole oxidizer. While large mole fractions of molecular oxygen are encountered in many combustion scenarios, there are select systems where ammonia is more likely to be oxidized via nitrogen-containing species (e.g. N 2 O and NO 2 ) and, more generally, there are relatively untested reaction sets that would be accentuated in such conditions. To address these gaps in available experimental data needed for the validation of ammonia kinetics models, jet-stirred reactor experiments were performed for mixtures of NH 3 /N 2 O/N 2 over an intermediate temperature range (850-1180 K). In these experiments, the mole fractions of NH 3 , N 2 O, and NO were measured using a combination of gas chromatography, chemiluminescence, electrochemical detection, and infrared absorption – where agreement among the different diagnostics (within 3% for N 2 O and 7% for NO) ensured high confidence in the experimental measurements. Comparison of the experimental results and model predictions suggested deficiencies in commonly used models for nitrogen kinetics. Various modeling analyses pointed to the central role of the N 2 O + NH 2 = N 2 H 2 + NO reaction, on which recent kinetic models all rely on the same rate constant estimate that appears to have not been tested in previous validation data sets for NH3 kinetics. A second set of jet-stirred reactor experiments were performed for mixtures of NH 3 /NO 2 /O 2 /N 2 over a slightly different temperature range (700–1100 K). Agreement among different diagnostics (≤7% for NO2 and ≤4% for NH 3 ) and excellent experimental repeatability confirmed high confidence in all species measurements. Measured mole fractions were compared to predictions from five recently developed kinetic models using flux analysis and uncertainty-weighted kinetic sensitivity analysis, both of which pointed to the importance of reactions involving H 2 NO that are both influential in this system and highly uncertain. The measurements from the jet-stirred reactor experiments presented here were combined with comprehensive sets of experimental data and high-level theoretical kinetics calculations using the MultiScale Informatics (MSI) approach to unravel the large uncertainties present in current NH3 oxidation kinetic sub-models. Emphasis was placed on NH 3 oxidation via nitrogen-containing species as this chemistry has been shown to accentuate influential reactions (e.g., the NO 2 +NH 2 and NH 2 +NO reactions) that are known to be important during the combustion of many energetic materials (e.g., AN, ADN, and AP). The resulting MSI model accurately predicted nearly all of the experimental and theoretical target data within estimated or reported uncertainties. Additional predictions of two NH 3 /NO 2 validation data sets, which were not included in the MSI framework, demonstrated its ability to accurately extrapolate predictions to untested T/P/X conditions, indicating that the converged MSI model demonstrates truly predictive behavior. The MSI NH 3 oxidation model presented here should be considered for inclusion in many energetic material models as the NH 3 /NO x kinetic system is known to be important to the combustion of various propellant and explosive formulations. This sub-model will help to form a foundational gas-phase kinetic model relevant to many different energetic materials, including those that contain inorganic additives for increased energy density and blast effects.",2022
Contact-free and fast detection of energetic materials in containments,"The identification of energetic materials in containments is an important challenge for analytical methods in the field of safety and security. Opening a package without knowledge of its contents and the resulting hazards is highly involved with risks and should be avoided whenever possible. Therefore, preferable methods work non-destructive with minimal interaction and are capable of identifying target substances in a containment quickly and reliably. Most spectroscopic methods find their limits, if the target substance is shielded by a covering material. To solve this problem, a combined laser drilling method with subsequent identification of the target substance by means of Raman spectroscopic measurements through microscopic bore holes of the covering material is presented. A pulsed laser beam is used for both the drilling process and as an excitation source for Raman measurements in the same optical setup. Results show the ability of this new method to gain high-quality spectra even when performed through microscopic small bore channels. With the laser parameters chosen right, the method can even be performed on highly sensitive explosives like triacetone triperoxide (TATP). Another advantageous effect arises in an observed reduction in unwanted fluorescence signal in the spectral data, resulting from the confocal-like measurement setup with the bore hole acting as aperture.",2021
Safer and Performing Energetic Materials Based on Polyaniline-Doped Nanocomposites,"Nanothermites, combining a fuel with an oxidizer at the nanoscale, represent a class of energeticmaterial that has been attracting increasing attention over the past decade. This intensive interest is due to their tuneable pyrotechnic performance, making the materials promising candidates for ordnance applications. However, the extreme mechanical and electrostatic sensitivities of energetic composites make handling them hazardous. In this study, a realistic desensitization method is suggested via the addition of polyaniline while maintaining an interesting combustion velocity in contrast to the literature values. This investigation claims a major scientific breakthrough in the preparation of safer energetic nanocomposites.",2017
A facile method to prepare energetic materials (EMs),"Two powerful yet safe energetic materials (EMs) have been synthesized with high yield via a facile method. We used low-cost industrial products as starting materials and water as a solvent rather than organic solvents without generating harmful by-products during the two-step synthetic procedure. Purification of the target materials could be obtained through a simple separation process with low energy consumption. Moreover, the thermal stability, insensitivity, and explosive performance of these two EMs are better than that of commonly used energetic materials such as TNT and TATB (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene).",2017
Principles of Regulation of Combustion Characteristics of Condensed Energetic Materials,"The models were investigated to estimate the influence of additives on combustion characteristics of solid propellants. In the homogeneous case the simple equations for burning rate and temperature in the reaction front were considered which take into account heat effect of the additive and relation between the rates of additive transformation and main (leading) reaction. Calculations have shown that additive influences in the definite region of pressures, moreover the curves of dependence of pressure and temperature coefficients on pressure may have extreme (minimum or maximum). In the heterogeneous case a layer system model (sandwich) was used in which a heat exchange between the base material (oxidizer or homogenous mixture of it with fuel) and the additive through the combustion front in the condensed and gas phases was considered. It was stated the existence of different ways of additive influence depending on relation between the preheating zone width and size of additive. At small sizes of additive the full heat exchange between components occurs and the system becomes of homogeneous structure, at great sizes the additive does not influence the burning. But at middle sizes the intermediate regimes in the dependencies arise: the additive with a heating effect causes slowing-down of burning rate growth with pressure and pressure coefficient decreases, in the case of cooling effect of additive the rate growth accelerates and pressure coefficient increases. The theoretical results were confirmed by experimental date on combustion of solid propellants containing ammonium perchlorate (AP), ammonium dinitramide, nitramines, nitrate esters and various additives.",2009
Crack Mechanism of Al@Al,"The addition of aluminum (Al) powders to energetic formulations is popular to increase energy, while it gives rise to an issue of how to maximize energy release therein. Cracking Al particles is an efficient way to enhance reactivity and energy release. In the present work, we confirm the crack of Al nanoparticles in hot energetic materials by molecularly simulating the evolution of Al@Al2O3 nanoparticles (ANPs) with imperfect shells and Al slabs covered by perfect Al2O3 layers in a heated widely applied energetic material, 1,3,S-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). The thickening of imperfect shells at an ambient condition by the outward migration of core AI atoms to react with RDX is observed. This thickening is helpful to strengthen the shells and hold melted Al and enhance the internal stress until the crack. While the perfect shells protect the reactions between core Al atoms and RDX, they also induce a crack when heating ANPs at a high temperature. This work is also expected to present an atomic perspective about the structural evolution of other active metallic particles in the wavefront as an extreme in the application.",2021
Effect of microstructure on the detonation initiation in energetic materials,"In this work we examine the role of the microstructure on detonation initiation of energetic materials. We solve the reactive Euler equations, with the energy equation augmented by a power deposition term. The deposition term is based on simulations of void collapse at the microscale, modeled at the mesoscale as hot-spots, while the reaction rate at the mesoscale is modeled using density-based kinetics. We carry out two-dimensional simulations of random packs of HMX crystals in a binder. We show that mean particle size, size distribution, and particle shape have a major effect on the transition between detonation and no-detonation, thus highlighting the importance of the microstructure for shock-induced initiation.",2019
Cocrystal Engineering of a High Nitrogen Energetic Material,"Cocrystallization of energetic materials has emerged as a strategy to modulate properties through directed selection of coformers. Here, the cocrystallization of a high-nitrogen energetic material, 3,6-bis(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-ylamino)-s-tetrazine (BTATz), is detailed. The utility of electrostatic potential maps to predict the behavior of coformers with BTATz is demonstrated as well as a critical requirement for regions of sufficiently negative electrostatic potential on the coformer (V-s,V-min). Cocrystal structures are compared to the solvent-free structure of BTATz, determined here for the first time. The new materials exhibit good thermal stability (>200 degrees C) and are insensitive to impact. Cocrystallization of BTATz demonstrates the capability of high-nitrogen energetic materials to form multicomponent crystal systems and reaffirms the ability of coformers to modulate energetic performance.",2018
Hydrogen Transfer in Energetic Materials from ReaxFF and DFT Calculations,"Energetic materials are characterized by fast and complex chemical reactions. It makes them hardly available for kinetic experiments in relevant conditions and a good target for reactive molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, unimolecular and condensed-phase thermal decomposition Of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) are investigated by ReaxFF molecular dynamics. It is shown that the decomposition kinetics in condensed phase may be described with the activation barrier lower by a factor of 2 than that for isolated molecules. The effect of the intermolecular hydrogen transfer is revealed in condensed phase. Energetic barriers for hydrogen transfer in two energetic materials (methyl nitrate, which is a nitroester as well as PETN, and o-nitrotoluene) are studied with ReaxFF and DFT using nudged elastic band technique. The results indicate that ReaxFP gives significantly lower activation energy for intermolecular hydrogen transfer in nitroesters than different DFT approximations, which ,explains the molecular dynamics results for PETN.",2017
Analysis of gap formation in the casting of energetic materials,"The problem of undesirable separation of the cast material from the mold in the casting of energetic materials is investigated. Comprehensive models are developed to simulate the heat and mass transfer processes during melt casting of energetic materials, as well as the resulting thermal stresses induced. The thermal and stress models are dynamically coupled. Predictions from the validated numerical model show excellent agreement with experimental measurements. The size and location of the separation are also predicted by the present model. Means to control and suppress separation are explored, and it is demonstrated that the separation can be controlled through proper choice of cooling conditions.",2007
Research on Electromagnetic Radiation Mechanism during Detonation of Energetic Material,"In the process of deflagration of energetic materials, strong electromagnetic radiation is generated, which causes the surrounding electronic equipment to fail to work normally. To solve this problem, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of electromagnetic radiation generated by energetic materials. The mechanism of plasma changed by the deflagration of energetic materials is an important topic in the aerospace and geophysics fields. The academic community holds two main viewpoints on the mechanism of electromagnetic radiation generated by energetic materials: one is that the solid material is squeezed and deformed during the deflagration of energetic materials, and the charges of different polarities rub in space to form effective electric dipoles, which eventually generate electromagnetic radiation. Another view is that the deflagration of energetic materials causes the temperature of the medium to rise sharply, and bremsstrahlung is formed during the compression and diffusion of the high-temperature wave front, resulting in the generation of electromagnetic radiation. This paper, based on theoretical analysis and experimental data, holds the view that electromagnetic radiation is generated by the high-temperature thermal effect. It studies the relationship between temperature and electromagnetic radiation and obtains quantitative analysis conclusions.",2022
Two-Dimensional Materials for the Catalytic Degradation of Energetic Compounds,"Effective remediation of energetic compounds such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (2,4,6-TNT) and 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) persists as an intransigent problem throughout the lifecycle of munitions. At the point of manufacture, contamination of groundwater with munitions energetics constituents is a major environmental concern while at end-of-lifecycle, demilitarization of stockpiled munitions still requires novel and efficient technological solutions. Utilizing electrochemical methods and reactions implementing Fenton’s Reagent, energetic compounds have proven themselves amenable to molecular degradation via oxidative and reductive processes in the presence of a catalyst. However, traditional catalysts such as iron, in the case of Fenton’s Reagent, or platinum, in the case of electrochemistry, present practical concerns such as recyclability and cost. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials that have generated a substantial amount of attention in the scientific community because of their mechanical, electrical, and catalytic properties. Comprised of a single atomically-thin layer, materials such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have demonstrated excellent catalytic performance in reactions such as the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). Here, we propose to study 2D materials as catalysts in various reactions for the chemical degradation of energetic compounds such as 2,4,6-TNT. We will implement electrochemical reactions, study complementary 2D materials, and optimize the reactions’ conditions to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.",2022
Forging of Hierarchical Multiscale Capabilities for Simulation of Energetic Materials,"We present new capabilities for investigation of microstructure in energetic material response for both explicit large-scale and multiscale simulations. We demonstrate the computational capabilities by studying the effect of porosity on the reactive shock response of a coarse-grain (CG) model of the energetic material cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), the non-reactive equation of state for a porous representative volume element (RVE) of CG RDX, and utilization of available supercomputing resources for speculative sampling to accelerate hierarchical multiscale simulations. Small amounts of porosity (up to 4 %) are shown to have significant effect on the initiation of reactive CG RDX using large-scale reactive dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Non-reactive RVEs are shown to undergo a porosity-dependent pore collapse at hydrostatic conditions, and an existing automation framework is shown to be easily modified for the incorporation of microstructure while retaining reliable convergence properties. A novel predictive sampling method based on use of kernel density estimators is shown to effectively accelerate time-to-solution in a multiscale simulation, scaling with free CPU cores, while making no assumptions about the underlying physics for the data being analyzed. These multidisciplinary studies of distinct yet connected problems combine to provide methodological insights for high-fidelity modeling of reactive systems with microstructure.",2020
Crystal Engineering for Creating Low Sensitivity and Highly Energetic Materials,"Energy and safety are the two most important concerns of energetic materials (EMs), while they usually contradict each other: the high energy typically goes together with low safety. Low sensitivity and highly energetic materials (LSHEMs) balance well the energy and safety and thus are highly desired for extensive applications. Nevertheless, on the whole, the energy safety contradiction, the energy and component limits, and insufficient knowledge about the relationships among components, structures, and properties and performances of EMs have made the development of LSHEMs, or even the entire group of EMs, evolve slowly. This Perspective focuses upon the current progress in the clarifications of the energy safety contradiction and the crystal packing impact sensitivity relationship of EMs. Also, we propose strategies for creating new LSHEMs or desensitized EMs through crystal engineering, covering traditional EMs composed of neutral single-component molecules, energetic cocrystals, and energetic ionic salts. Two levels of intrinsic structures, molecule and crystal, are accounted for in constructing LSHEMs: at the molecular level, it is proposed to store much chemical energy in bonds while avoiding any bond formation in an energetic molecule that is too weak to intrinsically balance the energy and safety; at the level of crystal, it is suggested that intermolecular interactions be enhanced to increase packing compactness and energy density and to strengthen the anisotropy of the intermolecular interactions to facilitate ready shear slide and low mechanical sensitivity; and overall, a big pi-bonded energetic molecule with an oxygen balance close to zero and a hydrogen bond-aided face-to-face pi-pi molecular stacking is preferred as a LSHEM. Hopefully, this Perspective will set a root for establishing a systematic theory for creating LSHEMs.",2018
"A biography of potassium complexes as versatile, green energetic materials","Potassium-based energetic complexes are environmentally friendly compared to their traditional heavy metal counterparts. They also have higher energy densities and better thermal stabilities than the parent organic compounds due to the deprotonation and introduction of the potassium cation. According to the anion ligands, they can be classified as nitrophenol-, furazan-, furoxan-, triazole-, tetrazole-, and their derivative-based potassium complexes. More than 20 potassium complexes have been prepared, with their crystal structures analyzed and properties characterized, demonstrating their superiority to traditional energetic materials. Multi-coordinated potassium cations facilitate the formation of energetic three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks, making them better candidates as energetic materials for both defense and civil applications.",2016
Synthesis and properties of RDX/GAP nano-composite energetic materials,"Fuel or oxidant composites were trapped in the holes of poly(azide glycidyl ether) (GAP) gel skeleton network on nano-scale, which could effectively increase the contact area, decrease the transport distance, and make the energy release more close to the ideal state to achieve the maximum power of energetic materials. In this study, GAP gels with three dimensional nano-network structures were prepared by sol-gel method using GAP as precursors and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as curing agent. The obtained gels were well characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET).The results showed that the specific surface area and dominant pore size were about 41.78 m(2)/g and 5 30 nm, respectively. Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) could be crystallized in the pore of GAP gel skeleton, so RDX/GAP nano-composite materials were prepared by solute crystallization in combination with a modified drying technology. The average grain size of RDX in GAP network was 20 46 nm. With the increase of the loadings of RDX, the specific surface area of GAP/RDX nano-composite materials decreased, and the thermal decomposition temperature of RDX in RDX/GAP nano-composite materials decreased by 33 37 A degrees C. The decomposition heat and explosion heat of RDX(40 wt%)/GAP nano-composite materials were higher by over 13.9 and 19.3 % than those of RDX(40 wt%)/GAP physical blend materials, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of RDX(40 wt%)/GAP nano-composite materials was lower than that of physical blend materials according to the results from our impact sensitivity test.",2015
Thermal analysis of high-temperature fast reactions in energetic materials,"To get round two main difficulties of the kinetic study of fast reactions of high-temperature decomposition of energetic materials (EM) (spatial nonisothermality and self-inflammation) two new methods for sample preparation called ''mechanical dilution'' and ''thermal dilution'' were applied. In the first part of the presentation, some experimental and theoretical data on kinetics of fast high-temperature decomposition of some typical homogeneous and heterogeneous energetic materials (including pyroxylin, ammonia copper chromate, ammonium perchlorate, solid rocket propellants, and others) are given. In a number of cases, kinetic constants of fast reactions dominating at high temperatures were shown to significantly differ from those of low-temperature reactions. The second part of the presentation deals with a new method of thermal analysis-electrothermal analysis (ETA). By using a multi-channel high-speed optical pyrometer, variation of the temperature field in an electrically heated sample of conductive energetic material (or its mixture with metal powder) during its heating followed by thermal explosion is registered. Due to application of this method in the ETA-100 (allowing one to measure kinetic data at the temperature up to 3800 K with a time step as short as 0.1 ms, i.e., for full conversion times as short as 10(-3) s) some important patterns of mechanisms of gasless combustion and explosion in SHS-mixtures (Si + C, Ni + Al, and Ti + C) were identified. More details regarding these and some additional important aspects can be found in [1, 2].",2011
ANN Model of Preparation of Energetic Materials by Spray Drying,"Spray drying is an effective method to reduce shock sensitivity of energetic materials with the advantages of integrating atomization, drying, crystallization, and coating in one step. However, with the complex hydrodynamics and crystal growth process during spray drying, the development of theoretical models is very difficult. Therefore, five types of artificial neural network (ANN) models are proposed to accurately predict the mean particle size of energetic materials prepared by spray drying, such as Cascade-forward back propagation neural network (CFBP), Elman-forward back propagation neural network (EFBP), Feed-forward back propagation neural network (FFBP), Generalized regression neural network (GR) and Radial basis neural network (RB). The model input parameters are the inlet temperature (T), the liquid flow rate (L), the gas flow rate (G), the mass fraction (w), the molecular weight (M), and the surface tension (delta). The output parameter is the mean particle sizes (dp). To further illuminate the superior performance of ANN model, the effects of temperature, liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, mass fraction, and surface tension on the mean particle size are conducted. The ANN model of mean particle size for the energetic materials prepared by spray drying could be much useful for further improving its property.",2021
Impact of Stereo- and Regiochemistry on Energetic Materials,"The synthesis, physical properties, and calculated performances of six stereo- and regioisomeric cyclobutane nitric ester materials are described. While the calculated performances of these isomers, as expected, were similar, their physical properties were found to be extremely different. By alteration of the stereo- and regiochemistry, complete tunability in the form of low- or high-melting solids, stand-alone melt-castable explosives, melt-castable explosive eutectic compounds, and liquid propellant materials was obtained. This demonstrates that theoretical calculations should not be the main factor in driving the design of new materials and that stereo- and regiochemistry matter in the design of compounds of potential relevance to energetic formulators.",2019
Effects of Shear Rate during Energetic Material Processing on Reactivity,"Energetic materials are often processed at high rates of deformation as colloidal slurries and then cured. The slurries are non-Newtonian colloidal solutions that exhibit changes in microstructure with variations in applied flow. This study shows that changes to microstructure due to applied flow affect the reactivity of energetic thin films. Energetic thin films of identical composition and geometry are prepared with different applied shear rates, which produce variations in the film microstructure by segregating smaller particles toward surfaces. Results show that films exhibit significant gains in flame speed with increasing shear rate. The differences in flame speed are linked to variations in microstructure. Specifically, densification of smaller particles near a boundary promote increased flame speeds. However, when particles become segregated, larger particles tend to contribute less to the overall reaction because they burn slowly compared to the smaller particles. When segregated, the larger particles may not be adding chemical energy to the reaction front because propagation is dominated by the more ignition sensitive smaller particles. This study demonstrates explicit changes in reactivity arising from changes in processing conditions that affect microstructure. Controlling applied shear rate introduces a new approach to regulating energetic material reactivity when processed using extrusion-based advanced manufacturing techniques.",2019
Salts of Tetrazolone - Synthesis and Properties of Insensitive Energetic Materials,"Tetrazolone (5-oxotetrazole, 1) is formed by diazotization of 5-aminotetrazole in the presence of CuSO4. Nitrogen-rich salts such as guanidinium (2), 1-aminoguanidinium (3), 1,3-diamino-guanidinium (4), 1,3,5-triamino-guanidinium (5), ammonium (6), hydrazinium (7) and the hydroxylammonium (8) salts of tetrazolone were prepared by facile deprotonation or metathesis reactions. All compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and DSC measurements. The heats of formation of 28 were calculated using the atomization method based on CBS-4M enthalpies. With these values and the experimental (X-ray) densities several detonation parameters such as the detonation pressure, velocity, energy and temperature were computed using the EXPLO5 code (V.5.04). In addition, the sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrical discharge were tested using the BAM drop hammer and friction tester as well as a small scale electrical discharge device.",2012
Numerical modeling of shock-to-detonation transition in energetic materials,"Determining the hazard classification of energetic materials is important for transportation safety and storage concerns. To avoid costly grain redesign and additional testing, a model that adequately predicts the shock sensitivity of energetic materials is required, particularly the outcome of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Large Scale Gap Test. The goals of this effort are to develop and validate computational tools that predict the shock sensitivity of energetic materials. Specifically, to use our packing code, Rocpack, to generate morphologies of interest for shock sensitivity assessments, and to use our CFD code, RocSDT, to propagate shocks of various strengths through the pack to predict the onset of detonation. Dealing accurately with the material interfaces in this problem is a long-standing challenge, as familiar strategies lead to spurious temperature spikes, and therefore spurious reaction rate spikes. We describe a new strategy, which does not generate spurious spikes, and demonstrate via a number of test problems that numerical convergence can be achieved. We also examine two problems that are stepping stones to a complete simulation; both are planar. In the first, we consider the passage of a shock wave through pure HMX in which a line of hot spots of the kind generated by void collapse are located a short distance behind the shock. When the hot spot spacing is large, the shock remains a shock; when small, transition to detonation occurs. In the second problem we also insert hot spots, but into a matrix of HMX particles and binder. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2012
Experimental and numerical study of dense layered nano-energetic materials,"This paper deals with the reaction of dense Metastable Intermolecular Composite (MIC) materials. The energy density of MIC nanocomposite materials is much higher than that of conventional energetic materials. The reaction of a multilayer thin film of aluminum and copper oxide has been studied by varying the substrate material and thicknesses, to vary the heat loss during the reaction of the MIC material. The in-plane speed of propagation of the reaction was experimentally determined using a time of-flight technique. The experiment shows that the reaction is completely quenched for a silicon substrate having an intervening silica layer of less than 200 nm. The speed of reaction seems to be constant at 40 m/s for silica layers with thickness greater than I gm. Different substrate material such as glass was also used. A numerical analysis of the thermal transport from the reacting film shows that the temperature profiles become self similar for substrate thicknesses larger than 1 mu m., the maximum temperature stays constant for both silica and composite silica/silicon substrates, showing the effectiveness of the composite substrates to control the heat lost from the reaction, both experimentally and numerically.",2008
Review of Nano-thermites: a Pathway to Enhanced Energetic Materials,"Nano-thermites or metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) have been implemented into modern research on energetic materials as they offer much higher energy densities, higher rates of energy release, stability, and safety (lower sensitivity). This paper reviews several synthetic methods for MICs that have been well thought-out for energetic applications, advantages and disadvantages, as well as the characteristics of each manufacturing technique. The techniques presented include powder mixing, sol-gel, synthesis of MICs based on nano-porous silicon (Psi), sputtering, multilayer nano-foils and electrolytically plated carbon nano-materials for nano-thermite applications. These techniques offer enormously different characteristics and, through the variation of various chemical techniques and conditions, a wide range of chemical and energetic properties may be attained. This may give the opportunity for the safe use of MICs as replacements for some conventional energetic materials in various applications, and may also enable us to study the effects when incorporating these MICs into energetic matrixes, as a promising and feasible research field.",2021
Silver Azide Nanoparticles Embedded into Silica as Energetic Nano-materials,"Silver azide is a primary high explosive that can be initiated by different means. In this work, silver azide nanoparticles were obtained, embedded into silica, and further derivatized with biotin. TEM, DLS, and IR measurements were used to characterize the hybrid energetic nanoparticles. The hybrid nanoparticles are made from an explosive core (silver azide) and a shell (silica), to which has been attached through an organic linker a biological target vectot (biotin). These hybrid nanoparticles can be used as models to study smart energetic nano-materials",2015
Tailoring and Scaling Energetic Aluminum Clusters into Cluster Assembled Materials,"As matter decreases in size the importance of a single atom increases exponentially. The properties of clusters, molecules with less than 100 atoms, will change drastically with the addition or removal of a single atom. Clusters have been shown to have properties that mimic other elements and properties that are completely unique. Cluster assemblies could enable the tailoring of precise properties in materials, providing cheap replacements for expensive elements, or novel materials for new applications. Aluminum clusters show great potential use in many applications including energy and catalysis. This work is focused on gaining a better understanding of how geometry and electronic structure affect aluminum cluster reactivity and how useful clusters might be successfully assembled into materials. The effects of doping aluminum cluster ions with boron atoms are reported and show that the addition of a single boron atom usually stabilizes the cluster while adding more boron atoms results in a breaking of symmetry and destabilization. A new analytical technique, matrix isolation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (MICRDS) was developed to help bridge the gap between gas phase cluster studies and condensed phase cluster materials. Molecules are trapped in an inert matrix and studied using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. MICRDS has the potential to also combine clusters into small stable units that would maintain their advantageous gas phase properties.",2015
Preparation and characterization of energetic materials coated superfine aluminum particles,"This work is devoted to protect the activity of aluminum in solid rocket propellants by means of solvent/non-solvent method in which nitrocellulose (NC) and Double-11 (shortened form of double-base gun propellant, model 11) have been used as coating materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the morphology of coated Al particles. Other characterization data of coated and uncoated Al particles, such as infrared absorption spectrum, laser particle size analysis and the active aluminum content were also studied. The thermal behavior of pure and coated aluminum samples have also been studied by simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that: superfine aluminum particles could be effectively coated with nitrocellulose and Double-11 through a solvent/non-solvent method. The energetic composite particles have core-shell structures and the thickness of the coating film is about 20-50 nm. The active aluminum content of different coated samples was measured by means of oxidation-reduction titration method. The results showed that after being stored in room temperature and under 50% humidity condition for about 4months the active aluminum content of coated Al particles decreased from 99.8 to 95.8% (NC coating) and 99.2% (Double-11 coating) respectively. Double-11 coating layer had a much better protective effect. The TG-DTA and DSC results showed that the energy amount and energy release rate of NC coated and Double-11 coated Al particles were larger than those of the raw Al particles. Double-11 coated Al particles have more significant catalytic effect on the thermal decomposition characters of AP than that of NC coated Al particles. These features accorded with the energy release characteristics of solid propellant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014
The Detection of Energetic Materials by Laser Photoacoustic Overtone Spectroscopy,"Laser-based sensors offer high sensitivity and species selectivity with real-time capabilities for monitoring the vapors of some energetic materials. However, the extremely low vapor pressure of many solid energetic materials under ambient conditions impedes these sensors. In this paper, we report on a novel technique based on laser photoacoustic overtone spectroscopy to detect and differentiate solid 1,3,5-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX), and 2 4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) in real time at ambient conditions. A tunable, near-infrared laser excites the target compound in the spectral region between 5800 to 6100 cm(-1), and a microphone monitors the sound that they generate by non-radiative, collisional de-excitation processes. The photoacoustic signals result from first-overtone and combination absorptions of the energetic material's C-H vibrations, and the collisional processes enhance the signal at atmospheric pressure. The spectra reveal features that are unique to each measured material and these features can serve as a fingerprint for that material. We report the effects of laser energy and wavelength on signal intensity and estimate a detection limit for these compounds.",2012
Computational Study on Substituted ,"s-Triazine is the essential candidate of many energetic compounds due to its high nitrogen content, enthalpy of formation and thermal stability. The present study explores s-triazine derivatives in which different -NO2, -NH2 and -N-3 substituted azoles are attached to the triazine ring via C-N linkage. The density functional theory is used to predict geometries, heats of formation and other energetic properties. Among the designed compounds, -N-3 derivatives show very high heats of formation. The densities for designed compounds were predicted by using the crystal packing calculations. Introduction of -NO2 group improves density as compared to -NH2 and -N-3, their order of increasing density can be given as NO2>N-3>NH2. Analysis of the bond dissociation energies for C-NO2, C-NH2 and C-N-3 bonds indicates that substitutions of the -N-3 and -NH2 group are favorable for enhancing the thermal stability of s-triazine derivatives. The nitro and azido derivatives of triazine are found to be promising candidates for the synthetic studies.",2012
DEVELOPMENT OF METAL CLUSTER-BASED ENERGETIC MATERIALS AT NSWC-IHD,"Current research efforts at NSWC-IHD are utilizing gas-phase molecular beam studies, theoretical calculations, and condensed-phase production methods to identify novel metal cluster systems in which passivated metal clusters make up the subunit of a molecular metal-based energetic material. The reactivity of NixAly+ clusters with nitromethane was investigated using a gas-phase molecular beam system. Results indicate that nitromethane is highly reactive toward the NixAly+ clusters and suggests it would not make a good passivating ligand for these cluster systems. To date, small amounts of a metal-based compound with a subunit containing four aluminum atoms and four Cp* ligands has been produced and was characterized using DSC and TGA. Results indicate this cluster material is more reactive than micron-and nano-sized aluminum. However lack of stability in air precludes it from being a viable replacement for current aluminum particles. Volumetric heat of combustion of Al50Cp*(12) was determined using thermodynamic data obtained from first principles calculations. The Al-50 cluster is found to have a heat of combustion near 60% that of pure aluminum.",2012
Compatibility study of BAMO-GAP copolymer with some energetic materials,"In order to investigate the safety properties of copolymer of poly(3,3'-bis(azidomethyl)oxetane) and glycidyl azide polymer (BAMO-GAP copolymer) applied in propellants, the compatibilities of BAMO-GAP copolymer with five energetic oxidants, three energetic plasticizers and three fuels, which are the common components used in solid propellants, were studied by DSC method. The rating was obtained according to the evaluated standards of compatibility. The results showed that BAMO-GAP copolymer had a good compatibility with cyclotetramethylenetetranitroamine (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), dihydroxylammonium 5,5'-bistetetrazole-1,1'-diolate (HATO), trimethyloleathane trinitrate (TMETN), N-butyl-N-(2-nitroxy-ethyl) nitramine (BuNENA), nitroglycerine (NG), Al and boron (B). However, the binary system of BAMO-GAP and 3,4-dinitrofurzanfuroxan (DNTF) was incompatible. There are interactions between aluminum hydride (AlH3) and BAMO-GAP. It should be more cautious that the BAMO-GAP is used as the binder of propellants containing AlH3.",2016
Aluminum Cluster Anion Reactivity: Applications in Energetic Materials and Catalysts,"The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the size-selective properties of aluminum clusters and their applications in catalysis and energetic materials. As the size of metals approaches the molecular regime, their properties begin to differ from the bulk. In fact, individual clusters exhibit different properties as even a single atom is added or removed. Some of these clusters display characteristics similar to elements of the periodic table, giving rise to a “3-D periodic table.” Additionally, some clusters demonstrate characteristics that are unique from any element, which is desirable for use in a variety of applications including catalysis and energetic materials. It is the goal of this research to study these clusters in detail in order to one day construct a material which maintains these desirable properties. Specifically, the resistance of specific aluminum clusters to reaction with oxygen is explored, and it is discussed how this could lead to the use of aluminum cluster-based solids in combustible materials. Additionally, recent research has led to the discovery of a unique form of aluminum cluster reactivity wherein polar bonds are catalytically broken. It is discussed how this mechanism could be used to generate hydrogen from water/alcohol or cleave high-energy carbonyl bonds. The possibility of a “cluster-assembled material” would imply that material properties could be selectively tailored to fit the needs of the application, which would give rise to a whole new field of solid-state physical chemistry.",2011
Low-temperature combustion of energetic materials in filled polymer systems,"In systems filled by inert additives, combustion. of cellulose nitrate (CN) proceeds in a flameless low-temperature regime with a low linear burning rate. At a standard temperature, the exponent in the low of CN combustion in ballasted mixtures with inert additives in the pressure range of 0.1 to 10 MPa is several times lower than that of pure cellulose nitrate and amounts to 0.23. The qualitative and quantitative composition of gaseous products of flameless CN conversion is found. It is noted that this composition approximately corresponds to data available in the literature for the products of thermal decomposition of cellulose nitrate at comparatively low temperatures. Based on this fact and on a weak dependence of the CN burning rate on pressure in ballasted systems, the process under these conditions is assumed to be controlled by conversion of the energetic component predominantly in the condensed phase. In the case of a composite consisting of cellulose nitrate, silicon carbide, and polymer binder, for samples 10-25 mm in diameter, armoring exerts practically no effect on combustion parameters. Combustion of the same mixture with smaller diameters of non-armored samples is unstable. The presence of a liner establishes a clearly expressed critical combustion diameter in the examined systems.",2007
New synthetic route to diaminonitropyrazoles as precursors of energetic materials,"Treatment of nitropyrimidine derivatives with (N-substituted) hydrazines (2 equiv.) gave 1-(substituted)-3,5-diamino-4-nitropyrazole. providing a very mild conversion of pyrimidines into pyrazoles. This reaction provided a convenient route to precursors for new efficient and insensitive explosives. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2003
Comparative Studies on Thermal Decompositions of Dinitropyrazole-Based Energetic Materials,"Dinitropyrazole is an important structure for the design and synthesis of energetic materials. In this work, we reported the first comparative thermal studies of two representative dinitropyrazole-based energetic materials, 4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazole (LLM-116) and its novel trimer derivative (LLM-226). Both the experimental and theoretical results proved the active aromatic N-H moiety would cause incredible variations in the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained energetic materials. Thermal behaviors and kinetic studies of the two related dinitropyrazole-based energetic structures showed that impressive thermal stabilization could be achieved after the trimerization, but also would result in a less concentrated heat-release process. Detailed analysis of condensed-phase systems and the gaseous products during the thermal decomposition processes, and simulation studies based on ReaxFF force field, indicated that the ring opening of LLM-116 was triggered by hydrogen transfer of the active aromatic N-H moiety. In contrast, the initial decomposition of LLM-226 was caused by the rupture of carbon-nitrogen bonds at the diazo moiety.",2021
Assembling Hybrid Energetic Materials with Controllable Interfacial Microstructures by Electrospray,"Constructing hybrid energetic materials (HEMs) consisting of nanothermites and organic high explosives is an efficient strategy to regulate the reactivity of energetic composites. To investigate the role of interfacial microstructures in determining the reactivity of HEMs, we employ electrospray, one ramification of electrohydrodynamic atomization, to assemble Al/CuO and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) into composites with various morphologies from different solvent systems. The morphology and compositional information of the assembled clay-like or granular HEMs, which are obtained from ketone, ester, or mixtures of alcohol and ether, are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The phase transition of CL-20 due to the fast evaporation of charged droplets and insufficient time for recrystallization is studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) is applied to investigate the thermodynamic behaviors and synergistic effect of the nanothermite and high explosive. Enhancements in combustion performance and pressurization characteristics of the as-sprayed HEMs have been observed through open burn tests and pressure cell tests. Granular HEMs show high gas generation and high pressurization rate, while nitrocellulose (NC) fibers existing in the clay-like HEMs would weaken the reactivity to a certain extent. HEMs obtained from the mixture of n-propanol and diethyl ether, in which nano-CL-20 exists as independent particles rather than a matrix, exhibit high gas generation but low pressurization rate. The results indicate that the energy releasing performance of the prepared HEMs can be readily regulated by constructing various interfacial microstructures to satisfy the broad requirements of energy sources.",2021
Cocrystals and Salts of Tetrazole-Based Energetic Materials,"Many energetic materials are unsuitable for practical purposes due to unacceptable sensitivity toward heat, impact, shock, or friction. In addition, chemical reactivity can also be of concern from the point of view of storage and shelf life. In order to develop new solid forms of energetic materials, several tetrazole-based energetic materials with suboptimal thermal and impact sensitivities were subjected to cocrystallization experiments to enhance their properties. Cocrystals and salts of the targets were obtained with several nitrogen- and oxygen-based acceptors. The impact sensitivity and thermal instability were substantially improved with the introduction of coformers. Particularly, the cocrystal 5-(nitrimino)-1H-tetrazole: pyrazine-N, N'-dioxide (D1:A6) has improved the decomposition temperature by 59 degrees C and was found to be about four times less impact sensitive than the parent explosive.",2020
RDX-based Energetic Material Cook-off Characters in Different Clearances,This paper presents the effects of clearance on reactive violence to RDX-based energetic material at the temperature rate of 2 +/- 0.2 degrees C / min. The experimental effort is to introduce the safe use of energetic materials in ammunitions and to reduce the vulnerability of energetic materials in practice. The results indicated that reactions were violent when charge clearance occurred. These phenomena are explained in relation to detonation theory. So clearance should be restricted for the safe use energetic materials in practice.,2012
Finite Volume Method for the Combustion Reaction of Energetic Materials,"In order to analyse the effects of launch on the internal structure due to launch and given the relative paucity of experimental tests in this regime numerical simulations are an important method of prediction. Viscoelastic statistical crack mechanics offer a solution to the dynamic damage problems of explosives involved in explosion, impact and collision. Most finite element software does not include a viscoelastic statistical crack constitutive model; the model can only be embedded in the finite element software. Therefore, a computer program based on the finite volume method combined with viscoelastic statistical crack mechanics is presented, aiming to analyze the explosion problems more precisely and conveniently. A combustion equation of state is proposed to study the combustion reaction of explosives; the trends of temperature and stress of explosive during the combustion process are studied; Hot spot zones formed inside explosives are analyzed. The results are in accordance with the reaction law of combustion. The results indicate that when the bottom of the explosive charge is heated to a certain temperature, the explosive charge have a combustion reaction occurs. This conclusion has important value for studying the effect of the base gap on the launch safety of explosive munitions.",2023
Shock-to-detonation transition behavior of functionally graded energetic materials,"The behavior of energetic materials is significantly influenced by the spatial distributions of microstructure heterogeneities and voids. We pursue the concept of Functionally Graded Energetic Materials whose microstructure features (e.g., grain size, grain volume fraction, void size, and void volume fraction) change spatially such that they may allow the behavior of the materials to be tailored. We explore using gradients in the density of voids to alter the detonation behavior of a polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) echoing PBX9501 with HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) grains and Estane binder. Five cases, two graded void distributions from 1% to 10% and 10% to 1% by volume along the length of the sample, and three uniform distributions matching the lowest (1%), average (5.5%), and highest (10%) void densities are considered. An Arrhenius reaction burn model is used to account for the chemical kinetics of HMX. Different detonation behaviors are obtained from the same graded sample when impact loading is from 1% void end and from the 10% void end as well as from the uniform cases. The SDT (shock to detonation transition) behaviors are analyzed in terms of the run distance, the time duration and shock velocity changes over the SDT process. The computational results are presented in the context of available experimental data for PBX9501 with which agreement is obtained through a parametric study. Overall, it is shown that gradients in microstructures of PBX can lead to SDT behaviors different or not obtainable from microstructures without gradients, thereby offering a mechanism for designing and tailoring new materials.",2023
Enhanced Energy Release from Homogeneous Carbon Nanotube-Energetic Material Composites,"In this study, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes with structures that can maximize energy transfer characteristics and activation with energetic materials were synthesized and energetic materials were effectively bound to the surface of the carbon nanotube structures to manufacture carbon nanotube-energetic material composites. The composites demonstrated drastically improved explosive reaction speeds compared with the energetic materials alone by using the high thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes. To this end, energetic materials, such as 4-nitrobenzenediazonium, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline, and RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) with nitro compounds having explosive explosophores were used and the exothermic reaction characteristics of the composites were analyzed using a thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry analyzer and an ultra-high-speed camera. When energetic materials were loaded on carbon nanotubes, the exothermic reaction speeds of all energetic materials increased by approximately 100 times compared with those of the energetic materials alone, regardless of the type of energetic materials, because of the high thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes. The minimum energetic material loading existed at which exothermic reaction speeds rapidly increased. In addition, the energetic material combustion reactions of carbon nanotube-energetic material composites occurred anisotropically along the axis of the carbon nanotubes. The results of the present study can be used in the development of new nanostructure-based explosive composites, propellants, and thermoelectrics.",2016
Mesoscale simulation of reactive pressed energetic materials under shock loading,"Shock load analysis of two different samples of pressed HMX energetic material is performed using the Eulerian compressible multimaterial code SCIMITAR3D. The numerical framework uses an image to computation approach to perform shock analysis on real microstructures of the energetic samples. Image processing algorithms are applied on SEM images of both samples to implicitly represent the microstructures using level set functions. The chemical decomposition of HMX is modeled using the Henson-Smilowitz multi-step kinetic mechanism. It is observed that microstructural characteristics play a crucial role in determining the ignition behavior of the energetic materials. For the applied shock loads and for the particular samples investigated, class III sample leads to initiation of chemical reaction and the class V sample does not ignite. It is also shown that the orientation of elongated voids with respect to incident shock load is an important factor contributing to the initiation of chemical reactions in the class III sample. This is explained by performing numerical experiments of elongated void oriented at different angles with respect to the shock load. Results show the importance of microstructural details, such as void size, distribution, and orientation for initiation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",2015
Desensitizing ignition of energetic materials when exposed to accidental fire,"Composite energetic materials combine fuel and oxidizers for high energy density exothermic reactions and are used for ordnance, industrial and localized power generation applications. This study focuses on examining an additive to a mixture of aluminum (Al) and copper oxide (CuO) to decrease ignition sensitivity under accidental fire exposure conditions. Ammonium nitrate (AN) was incorporated into Al+CuO, as a 1:1 replacement for CuO, for varied equivalence ratios and examined for ignition and combustion when exposed to slow and fast heating rate ignition conditions. The goal was to develop an Al+CuO+AN formulation that would perform comparable to Al+CuO when intentionally ignited, but would not ignite in an accidental fire. Experimental results show that Al+CuO+AN with an equivalence ratio (ER) ranging from 4.0-5.5 inerts the reactants when exposed to slow heating conditions, yet ignites with comparative combustion performance to the baseline Al+CuO mixture when exposed to fast heating conditions. These results are consistent with thermochemical simulations of the heat of combustion and adiabatic flame temperature for the respective reactions. This study presents a new approach for tailoring composite energetic materials toward accidental fire safety by exploiting the early stage decomposition kinetics of AN, which are activated only by slow heating ignition conditions.

On the Decomposition Mechanisms of New Imidazole-Based Energetic Materials,"New imidazole-based energetic molecules (1,4dinitroimidazole, 2,4-dinitroimidazole, 1-methyl-2,4-dinitroimidazole, and 1-methyl-2,4,5-trinitroimidazole) are studied both experimentally and theoretically. The NO molecule is observed as a main decomposition product from the above nitroimidazole energetic molecules excited at three UV wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm). Resolved rotational spectra related to three vibronic bands (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) of the NO (A 2 Sigma(+) <- X 2 Pi) electronic transition have been obtained. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is characterized for these four nitroimidazole energetic molecules: this pathway generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (10-60 K) and vibrationally hot (1300 1600 K) internal energy distribution. The predicted reaction mechanism for the nitroimidazole energetic molecule decomposition subsequent to electronic excitation is the following: electronically excited nitroimidazole energetic molecules descend to their ground electronic states through a series of conical intersections, dissociate on their ground electronic states subsequent to a nitro nitrite isomerization, and produce NO molecules. Different from PETN, 1-IMX, and RDX, the thermal dissociation process (ground electronic state decomposition from the Franck-Condon equilibrium point) of multi-nitroimidazoles is predicted to be a competition between NO2 elimination and nitro nitrite isomerization followed by NO elimination for all multinitroimidazoles except 1,4-dinitroimidazole. In this latter instance, N-NO2 homolysisis becomes the dominant decomposition channel on the ground electronic state, as found for HMX and RDX. Comparison of the stability of nitro-containing energetic materials with R NO2 (R = C, N, O) moieties is also discussed. Energetic materials with C-NO2 are usually more thermally stable and impact/shock insensitive than are other energetic materials with N-NO2 and O-NO2 moieties. The irnidazole aromatic ring also plays an important role in improving the stability of these energetic materials. Thus multinitroimidazoles energetic materials can be of significant potential for both civilian and military applications.",2013
Density functional study of guanidine-azole salts as energetic materials,"A series of guanidine cations and azole anions were designed for use as energetic salts. Their geometrical structures were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) method. The counter ions were matched by the similar magnitude of the electron affinity (EA) of the cation and the ionization potential (IP) of the anion. The densities, heats of formation, detonation parameters, and impact sensitivity were predicted. The incorporation of guanidine cations and diazole anions are favorable to form thermal stable salts except cation A1. The diaminoguanidine cation has greater impact on the density and detonation properties of the salts than the triaminoguanidine cation. 2-Amino-3-nitroamino-4,5-nitro-dinitropyrazole is the best anion for advancing the detonation performance among all the anions. Incorporating the C=O bond into the guanidine cations enhances the density and detonation performance of the guanidine-azole salts. The salts containing III1-III4 anion have better detonation properties than HMX, indicating that these salts are potential energetic compounds. Compared with RDX or HMX, some salts with diaminoguanidine cation display lower impact sensitivity.",2018
The Application of Thermal Analysis to Research on Energetic Materials,"This paper introduces briefly the application of thermal analysis in energetic materials and its importance.

It plays an important role in the thermal decomposition kinetics of energetic materials, stability and compatibility, and the determination of thermal physical constants.",2013
Predictions of thermodynamic properties of energetic materials using COSMO-RS,"In this work, conductor-like screening for real solvents (COSMO-RS) calculations were carried out using COSMOtherm program in conjunction with Gaussian03 packages. The objective was to predict thermodynamic properties for two nitrogen-rich energetic materials which are less harmful for the environment than the conventional ones, namely 3,6-di(hydrazino)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DHT) and 3,3'-azo-bis(6-amino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine) (DAAT) for which no experimental data are available to our best knowledge. COSMO-RS approach is a combination of quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic basis, which allow a physically meaningful description of molecular interactions between pure molecules and solvents in solution. Recently, this approach has been used for the prediction of an enormous number of physicochemical properties especially aqueous solubility, Henry's law constant, vapor pressure and partition coefficient. The vapor pressure of pure compounds is one of the most important thermodynamic properties required for the chemical process design as well as for the fate assessment of pollutants in the environment. To validate the accuracy of COSMO-RS approach for the two molecules of interest, six reference energetic molecules have been studied, for which experimental data are available, such as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) and n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA). From predicted results, a good agreement has been noted. DAAT molecule shows a lower volatility in the medium so that a low detectability compared to the DHT and other reference molecules. Both DHT and DAAT showed negative logarithmic values of Octanol-Water partition coefficients, this means that they don't have the tendency to enhance the bioaccumulation process in soils.

Multiscale thermodynamics of Ni/Al energetic structural materials under shock,"The influence of microstructure on the response of energetic structural materials (ESMs) under shock conditions remains inadequately quantified, and the energy release process is not thoroughly understood. In this work, taking the classical Ni/Al ESM as an example, the shock response was investigated by the shock compression theory with the microstructure-based chemical reaction kinetics model. This theory mainly refers to the equation of the state of multi-component materials with mixture rule, and the reaction at the particle contact interface is built to form the multiscale thermodynamics model. The physical states of material after shock, including relative volume, temperature, and extent of reaction, were analyzed. The results revealed the effect of the burn velocity, particle size and molar ratio on the shock response. Furthermore, the model facilitates a comprehensive understanding of energy release, the extent of the intermetallic reaction, and the oxidation reaction. Despite the involvement of only a small portion of materials in the oxidation reaction, the energy release proportion was comparable to that of the intermetallic reaction. Additionally, insights into the effect of the microstructure on the energy release revealed by the model matched the tests well.",2024
Interpretable Performance Models for Energetic Materials using Parsimonious Neural Networks,"Predictive models for the performance of explosives and propellants are important for their design, optimization, and safety. Thermochemical codes can predict some of these properties from fundamental quantities such as density and formation energies that can be obtained from first principles. Models that are simpler to evaluate are desirable for efficient, rapid screening of material screening. In addition, interpretable models can provide insight into the physics and chemistry of these materials that could be useful to direct new synthesis. Current state-of-the-art performance models are based on either the parametrization of physics-based expressions or data-driven approaches with minimal interpretability. We use parsimonious neural networks (PNNs) to discover interpretable models for the specific impulse of propellants and detonation velocity and pressure for explosives using data collected from the open literature. A combination of evolutionary optimization with custom neural networks explores and trains models with objective functions that balance accuracy and complexity. For all three properties of interest, we find interpretable models that are Pareto optimal in the accuracy and simplicity space.",2024
Manipulating sensitivities of planar oxadiazole-based high performing energetic materials,"Nitrogen-rich energetic materials based on five-membered azoles, such as tetrazoles, triazoles, oxadiazoles, pyrazoles, and imidazoles, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their environmental compatibility while maintaining high performance. These materials, including explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics, are designed to release energy rapidly and efficiently while minimizing the release of toxic or hazardous byproducts and have attracted potential applications in the defense and space industries. The presence of extensive N-C, N-N, and NN high energy bonds in azoles provides high enthalpies of formation and facilitates intermolecular interactions through pi-stacking which may help with reducing sensitivity to external stimuli. Now, we report on the synthesis and energetic properties of N-(5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)nitramide (5) and its energetic salts. These new high nitrogen-oxygen-containing materials have attractive feature applications of insensitivity and increased performance. The results from this study demonstrate that the planarity in azoles does contribute toward insensitivity. The safety advantage of planar 1,3,4-oxadiazole-tetrazole mixed azole is combined with the energy of nitroamine to achieve better physiochemical properties.image",2024
Michelson-Markstein effect in combustion of solid homogeneous energetic materials,The dependence of the burning rate of a solid homogeneous energetic material on curvature of the burning surface is investigated experimentally for the first time. For this purpose we use a double-slit propellant grain which allows realizing the curved burning surface with a controlled curvature. We compare the experimental data with theoretical dependencies obtained in the framework of the Zel'dovich-Novozhilov's theory. (C) 2019 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Indirect ignition of energetic materials with laser-driven flyer plates,"The impact of laser-driven flyer plates on energetic materials CL-20, PETN, and TATB has been investigated. Flyer plates composed of 25 mu m thick Al were impacted into the energetic materials at velocities up to 1.3 km/s. The flyer plates were accelerated by means of an Nd: YAG laser pulse. The laser pulse generates rapidly expanding plasma between the flyer plate foil and the substrate to which it is adhered. As the plasma grows, a section of the metal foil is ejected at high speed, forming the flyer plate. The velocity of the flyer plate was determined using VISAR, time of flight, and high-speed video. The response of the energetic material to impact was determined by light emission recorded by an infrared-sensitive photodiode. Following post-impact analysis of the impacted energetic material, it was hypothesized that the light emitted by the material after impact is not due to the impact of the flyer itself but rather is caused by the decomposition of energetic material ejected ( via the shock of flyer plate impact) into a cloud of hot products generated during the launch of the flyer plate. This hypothesis was confirmed through schlieren imaging of a flyer plate launch, clearly showing the ejection of hot gases and particles from the region surrounding the flyer plate launch and the burning of the ejected energetic material particles.",2017

The Advantages and Shortcomings of Using Nano-sized Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials are substances that can store chemical energy in their chemical bonds. An ideal energetic material is a substance with high performance, safety and shelf life. Many recent researches have concentrated on the synthesis or the development of new energetic materials with optimized properties, such as thermal stability, sensitivity and burn rate. The reduction of the particle size of energetic materials from micron to nano-sized is one of the suitable approaches for obtaining desirable properties. Recent progress on the reduction of the particle size of energetic materials is reviewed in this work. The effects of nano-sized particles on the performance of energetic compounds are also investigated.",2013
Enhancement of laser ignitibility of insensitive energetic materials (FOX-7),"Experimental investigation into the feasibility of optically sensitising an insensitive explosive, FOX-7 (1,1-Diamino-2,2-dinitroethene) by the doping of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) has been conducted. The commercially available GNPs were specifically designed in their particle shape and size to strongly absorb at the wavelength of the igniting laser (808 nm). The laser ignitibility of FOX-7 was significantly increased as the GNPs efficiently converted the absorbed energy into the heat. The laser ignitibility of such optically sensitised FOX-7 and the detonation capability of the laser initiator devices designed for the study were evaluated. Based on the evaluation of the initiator's output in term of impact pressure, it was shown that an GNPs doped FOX-7 based laser slapper initiator was able to detonate a secondary explosive. image",2023
Evaluation and design of metal-based gas-generating energetic materials,"Metal-oxidizer nanocomposites have recently attracted attention as potential gas-generating energetic materials (EMs) that can replace or augment common CHNO compounds in selected applications. Ex-perimentalists use enclosed chambers to ignite charges of metal-based EM and report pressures, P . Un-fortunately, the reported pressures cannot be compared directly between studies because of differences in the chamber volume, V , and mass, m , of the EM used in different experiments. A parameter PmiddotV/m, proportional to the released energy available for mechanical work is proposed to harmonize the reported experimental data. This parameter is both predicted using thermodynamic equilibrium analysis (here, em-ploying a well-known and readily available NASA CEA code) and recovered from published experimental data. Calculations also determine the adiabatic flame temperature, T , and molar amounts of the generated gas products, n , which are not easily obtained from experiments. Comparisons of calculations with exper-imental data suggest that some Al-based nano-thermites with CuO and MoO3 as oxidizers have achieved their theoretical performance levels, at least in small scale tests. Similarly, in some Al-ammonium nitrate EMs, theoretically predicted pressures have been observed experimentally. Available experimental data for B-based EMs suggest that all such EMs can be improved to achieve energetic performance closer to that predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Calculating PmiddotV/m and n/m for EMs with var-ied fuel/oxidizer ratios and different charge mass normalized per volume, m/V, offers an approach for designing thermodynamically optimized EM compositions with performance maximized at the tempera-ture ranges of interest and achievable in practical scenarios. Finally, calculations also show that for both Al and B as fuels, ammonium nitrate is superior as an oxidizer in terms of both gas generation and ability to perform work. These benefits are despite somewhat lower adiabatic flame temperatures, e.g., compared to the analogous EMs using ammonium perchlorate as an oxidizer.(c) 2023 The Combustion Institute.

Promising CL-20-Based Energetic Material by Cocrystallization,"A novel cocrystal (NEX-1) of CL-20 and MDNT is presented herein. The CL-20:MDNT cocrystal, obtained in high yield by resonant acoustic mixing, shows new properties versus the discrete components. This is the first example of cocrystallization of CL-20 where the new material is less sensitive to friction than CL-20 itself, while demonstrating similar impact and ESD sensitivity.

A Fluctuation Model of Photoinitiation of High-Sensitivity Energetic Materials,"A fluctuation hot-spot photoinitiation model is proposed for primary explosives. The model describes the explosion probability as a function of the initiation time. For the experimental verification of the model, an investigation of the dependence of an explosion on the initiation time, including the registration of the glow signal, is performed. It is found that the dependence of the characteristic time of the glow signal rise on the initiation time is of non-monotonic character. An evaluation of the model parameters is made.",2016
Recent Advances on the Solidification Processing of Cast Energetic Materials,"This paper investigates the solidification of highly viscous energetic materials cast into a projectile. Active cooling and heating (ACH) control solidification technology as well as mechanical vibration (MV) are applied to achieve unidirectional solidification and to reduce cracks, gas pores, and shrinkage defects and to decrease the detrimental gap size between the projectile and the solidified energetic material. A comprehensive numerical model was developed to simulate the solidification processes during casting of energetic materials, as well as the resulting induced thermal stresses. The optimized design parameters of the proposed technologies are developed based on numerical modeling and experiment work. A detailed comparison between the latest experiments performed at the University of Alabama, Solidification Laboratory, obtained with electrical heating and water cooling and with and without mechanical vibration is provided in this paper. In these experiments, a special wax material (e.g., Chlorez 700S) that has similar thermo-physical properties with the IMX-104 explosive material was used. Experiments performed at the USARMY ARDEC using the IMX-104 explosive material with steam heating and water cooling are also presented in this paper. These experiments are being used to further validate the numerical model.",2014
Effect of solid properties on impact sensitivity of energetic materials,"Solid properties of energetic materials under impact conditions of high pressure and strain-rate are reviewed. Experiments indicate that the flow stress of an energetic material may increase by a factor of about seven compared to atmospheric conditions. At moderate strain rates, the flow stress increases linearly with the logarithm of the strain rate; however, at higher strain-rates on the order of 10$\sp7$ s$\sp{-1}$, it may increase sharply by almost one order of magnitude compared to static conditions. Both pressure and strain-rate effects may increase considerably the temperatures that develop at hot spots. These observations are based on limited available data; therefore, static and dynamic test methods are reviewed and a few of them are recommended to obtain reliable and quantitative results. Several constitutive equations can be adopted; however, at present, a simple combination of the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation and Drucker-Prager pressure-dependent yield condition is recommended. The behavior at high strain rates is described by an additional linear viscosity model. The effect of the solid properties on the mechanism of hot-spot formation due to pore collapse under impact is studied by the hydrocode DEFEL. We pay special attention to the effects of pressure and viscosity on the temperatures that develop near the collapsing pore. The simulation results indicate that viscous heating is dominant, since the high strain rates near the collapsing pore produce a large viscous effect. We offer an explanation for the phenomenon of the reversal of sensitivity of explosives by considering the competing effects of visco-plastic heating and heat conduction during pore collapse. Without heat conduction the temperature increases with decreasing pore size. This trend is reversed when the pore becomes very small, and heat conduction prevails. Other issues that are discussed include the shape of the collapsed pore, the influence of the rise time of the shock on the resulting temperatures, and the ignition phase. In addition, dimensional analysis is used to support the simulation results. To aid future research, a more accurate plasticity model was developed, and static tests under pressure have been planned.",1993
Coating processes towards selective laser sintering of energetic material composites,"This research aims to contribute to the safe methodology for additive manufacturing (AM) of energetic materials. Coating formulation processes were investigated and evaluated to find a suitable method that may enable selective laser sintering (SLS) as the safe method for fabrication of high explosive (HE) compositions. For safety and convenience reasons, the concept demonstration was conducted using inert explosive simulants with properties quasi-similar to the real HE. Coating processes for simulant RDXbased microparticles by means of PCL and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (as TNT simulant) are reported. These processes were evaluated for uniformity of coating the HE inert simulant particles with binder materials to facilitate the SLS as the adequate binding and fabrication method. Suspension system and single emulsion methods gave required particle near spherical morphology, size and uniform coating. The suspension process appears to be suitable for the SLS of HE mocks and potential formulation methods for active HE composites. The density is estimated to be comparable with the current HE compositions and plastic bonded explosives (PBXs) such as C4 and PE4, produced from traditional methods. The formulation method developed and understanding of the science behind the processes paves the way toward safe SLS of the active HE compositions and may open avenues for further research and development of munitions of the future.

Heat Generation Mechanisms in Energetic Composite Materials Under Ultrasonic Excitation,"Thermal dissipation of mechanical energy from periodic loading in energetic materials (EMs) leads to the creation of areas of intense, localized heating, called hot spots. The impact and shock conditions for the hot spot initiation of solid explosives have been extensively explored, but little work has focused on high-frequency contact loading. In order to design formulations to address unintentional initiation by mitigating heating in polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) and other heterogeneous EMs, the mechanisms of heat generation which lead to the thermal initiation of energetic composites under ultrasonic excitation were explored. Heat generation mechanisms which may lead to unintentional initiation were identified through the diagnostic techniques of second harmonic generation (SHG) of δ-HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) crystals; X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI) performed at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source; infrared (IR) thermography; and optical microscopy. This work concludes with high-speed mesoscale observations of dense layers of PETN (pentaerythritol tetraniterate), CL-20 (hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane), RDX (1,3,5- trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), and HMX which were damaged or driven to decomposition under acoustic insult using the non-intrusive imaging technique of shadowgraphy to detect hot spots within the transparent binder. Recommendations are formed which address binder adhesion, energetic material properties, and particle morphology on the vibration sensitivity of a PBX formulation.",2019
The enhanced properties of energetic materials through ring replacement strategy,"In order to meet the high demands of modern energetic materials, numerous routes have been explored by the researchers. In this study, a ring replacement strategy was designed to enhance the energetic properties. The ring replacement compounds 11 (N,N'-methylenebis (N-(4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)- nitramide) and 15 (N,N'-ethylenebis (N-(4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)nitramide), in which the oxadiazole rings connected to the furazan backbone were replaced by tetrazole rings were characterized by x-ray single crystal diffraction and NMR (H-1, C-13, N-15). The results compounds show that the heats of formation and detonation performance of the replacement compounds were significantly better than those of the precursor compounds, and the nitrogen content of compounds 11 and 15 were improved from 41.18% and 39.81% to 54.9% and 53.08%, respectively, which belongs to the category of high nitrogen compounds. In a word, the ring replacement strategy in this work offers fresh routes for the improvement in properties of energetic materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020
Inhibition of soil microbial activity by nitrogen-based energetic materials,"We investigated individual toxicities of the nitrogen-based energetic materials (EMs) 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT); 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT); 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT); and nitroglycerin (NG) on microbial activity in Sassafras sandy loam (SSL) soil, which has physicochemical characteristics that support very high qualitative relative bioavailability for organic chemicals. Batches of SSL soil for basal respiration (BR) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) assays were separately amended with individual EMs or acetone carrier control. Total microbial biomass carbon (biomass C) was determined from CO2 production increases after addition of 2500mg/kg of glucose-water slurry to the soil. Exposure concentrations of each EM in soil were determined using US Environmental Protection Agency method 8330A. Basal respiration was the most sensitive endpoint for assessing the effects of nitroaromatic EMs on microbial activity in SSL, whereas SIR and biomass C were more sensitive endpoints for assessing the effects of NG in soil. The orders of toxicity (from greatest to least) were 4-ADNT>2,4-DNT=2-ADNT>NG for BR; but for SIR and biomass C, the order of toxicity was NG>2,4-DNT>2-ADNT=4-ADNT. No inhibition of SIR was found up to and including the greatest concentration of each ADNT tested in SSL. These ecotoxicological data will be helpful in identifying concentrations of contaminant EMs in soil that present acceptable ecological risks for biologically mediated processes in soil.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Femtosecond Laser Ablation of Energetic Materials,"To understand the physical and chemical responses of energetic materials, such as 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB, C6H4N2O4), hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL20, C6H6N12O12), and CL20/DNB co-crystal, to femtosecond laser ablation (FLA), their molecular reaction dynamics have been investigated using the ReaxFF/Ig force field. The computational results indicate that the temperature and pressure of the CL20/DNB system jump during FLA. In particular, the temperature and pressure gradually reach their maxima following an initial cooling process. N-NO2 bond breaking of the CL20 molecule triggers the reactions for both the CL20 and CL20/DNB systems. However, the CL20 system prevails the CL20/DNB co-crystal in the decomposition rate simply because coexistence of DNB molecules in the mixture and generated decomposition products containing benzene rings greatly reduce the effective collision probability between CL20 and the products.",2016

Incorporating Energetic Moieties into Four Oxadiazole Ring Systems for the Generation of High-Performance Energetic Materials,"The synthesis of three neutral 3,3-di(1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5,5-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole) structures in combination with different energetic moieties such as nitramino, trinitroethylamino, and N-nitrated trinitroethylamino is presented.

"Alkylene-functionality in bridged and fused nitrogen-rich poly-cyclic energetic materials: Synthesis, structural diversity and energetic properties","From the standpoint of chemical structures, the organic backbones of energetic materials can be classi fied into aromatic rings, nonaromatic rings, and open chains. Although the category of aromatic energetic compounds exhibits several advantages in the regulation of energetic properties, the nonaromatic heterocycles, assembling nitramino explosophores with simple alkyl bridges, still have prevailed in benchmark materials. The methylene bridge plays a pivotal role in the constructions of the classic nonaromatic heterocycle-based energetic compounds, e.g., hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), whereas ethylene bridge is the core moiety of state-of-the-art explosive 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL -20). In this context, it is of great interest to employ simple and practical bridges to assemble aromatic and nonaromatic nitrogen-rich heterocycles, thereby expanding the structural diversity of energetic materials, e.g., bridged and fused nitrogen-rich poly-heterocycles. Furthermore, alkyl-bridged poly-heterocycles highlight the potential for the open chain type of energetic materials. In this review, the development of alkyl bridges in linking nitrogen-rich heterocycles is presented, and the perspective of the newly constructed energetic backbones is summarized for the future design of advanced energetic materials.

"Metal salts of fused triazole-triazine as promising energetic materials: crystal structures, energetic properties and high thermal stability","The transformation of energetic materials into metal salts can enhance their thermal stability. A series of high-energy metal salts comprising sodium ions (4), potassium ions (5), rubidium ions (6), and cesium ions (7) were synthesized based on 3-(dinitromethanidyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4](triazin-4-yl)(nitro)amide (DTT). The elemental composition and crystal structures of compound 5-7 were determined using techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystallographic studies showed that the metal salt crystals had structural stability, likely due to the incorporation of metal ions into the compound. The compounds 5-7 underwent rigorous testing using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), which validated their thermal stability. The incorporation of metal ions induced notable modifications to the crystal packing and overall structure, endowing the high-energy salts with advantageous properties such as density (1.907-2.477 g cm-3), resistance to elevated temperatures (Td >= 270.39 degrees C) and good detonating properties.

Substitution of Nitrogen-Rich Linkers with Insensitive Linkers in Azide-Based Energetic Coordination Polymers toward Safe Energetic Materials,"Primary explosives with powerful and reliable stabilities have attractive applications in the field of military and civilian technologies. In this work, four two-dimensional, solvent free metal azide-based energetic coordination polymers [M-(N-3)(2)(btze)](n) (M = Co for 1, Cd for 2; btze = 1,2-bis(tetrazol-1-yl)ethane), [Cd-2(N-3)(3)Cl(btze)2], 3, and [Cd-2(N-3)(2)Br-2(btze)(2)](n) 4 were prepared through a hydrothermal reaction and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All four compounds exhibit two times higher heats of detonation than that of the traditional lead azide (LA), high thermal stabilities (>200 degrees C), and relatively low sensitivities. The values of enthalpies of formation (Delta H-f degrees) of 1 and 2 are high up to 4.088 and 3.925 kJ.g(-1), respectively, which belong to those of the largest Delta H-f degrees values among metal-based primary explosives. Although 1 and 2 are isostructural energetic compounds, their mechanical sensitivities are discrepant, which mainly originates from different metal atomic radii and distinct levels of repulsive steric clashes between the adjacent azides. As the less sensitive ligand btze is present in place of the previously reported atrz (4,4'-azo-1,2,4-triazole), the resultant coordination polymers with the same metal center exhibit lower mechanical sensitivities confirmed by experimental results and theoretical analyses. The mechanical sensitivities of 3 and 4 with almost the same structures display similarities despite different types and amounts of halogen ions in place of azide ions. Compounds 1 and 2 are detonated with a powerful blast. The sensitivities of 1 and 2 are in the range of applicable primary explosives, which makes 1 and 2 act as competitive and safe primary explosives.",2019
Insight into material behavior via surface free energy calculations for common energetic materials,"The Gibbs Free energy is a driving force for equilibrium crystal shapes and the formation of crystal facets in molecular crystals. Orientation dependence of interfacial properties is linked to surface free energy (SFE). Prediction of orientation-dependent properties such as thermal stability, mechanical response, and compatibility with binders require a systematic approach to the quantification of SFE. In molecular crystals, entropy has a much larger contribution among all ordered crystalline materials. In this paper, we extend our previously developed method to quantify SFE and entropy of beta-HMX to other common energetic materials-TATB, alpha-RDX, and PETN. Two complimentary approaches, Nonequilibrium Thermodynamic Integration (NETI) and Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) methods are used to obtain insight into interfacial phenomena along with surface free energy estimates. We discuss the relevance of surface free energy and the importance of surface entropy for facetted molecular crystals in understanding crystal properties, activation of slip planes, and potential pathways for fracture. These values allow us to predict theoretical crystal shape using Wulff Construction, better understand the effect of hydrogen bonding on SFE, and the diversity of bonding environment in energetic crystals. In particular, in crystals with low stacking fault energy, the SMD values can be inconclusive due to the triggering of slip plane motions. In cases where SMD simulations lead to large deformations and high uncertainty, the NETI approach can still provide SFE estimates.",2024
Processing and characterization of Sr doped BiFeO,"Multiferroic ceramics based on BiFeO3 and Sr-doped BiFeO3 have been processed by high energetic milling and later thermal treatments at reduced temperatures to synthesize the perovskite structure. Single phase materials are obtained at 800 degrees C, reducing the temperature needed to complete the reaction in solid state method. Ceramics with densities higher than 94% were obtained at 1000 degrees C, and up to 98% at 1050 degrees C. All the ceramics were obtained in a single thermal treatment, where synthesis, grain growth and densification take place. The addition of Sr stabilizes the BiFeO3 perovskite structure, avoiding its decomposition. Ceramics with higher dielectric permittivity and conductivity than non-doped materials are obtained, due to the increase of the amount of oxygen vacancies. It is shown for the first time that the grain boundary conductivity is increased in BiFeO3 by doping with Sr. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011
Regulation of external electric field on sensitivity of ICM energetic materials,"Context[2,2 '-Bi(1,3,4-oxadiazole)]-5,5 '-dinitramide (ICM-101), 2,4,6-triamino-5-nitropyrimidine-1,3-dioxide (ICM-102), and 6-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazine-2-oxide (ICM-103) are excellent China-made explosives, but their performance under external electric fields (EEF) has never been explored, especially sensitivity. To study the induction effect of EEF on it, the chemical reactivity, electron localization function (ELF), spectrum, and other parameters were calculated by density functional theory. The results show that the increasing EEF can weaken the oE(HOMO-LUMO) (oE(HOMO-LUMO) = E-HOMO-E-LUMO) materials, making the stability worse and the sensitivity higher. The proportion of the positive electrostatic surface potential area is also smaller under the increasing EEF, indicating that ICM molecules are becoming more and more unstable. The ELF and localized orbital locator (LOL) decrease with the increase of EEF strength, which suggests that the trigger bond length increases, the E-BDE decreases, and the molecular sensitivity increases. When the intensity of EEF increases, the absorption peak of the molecular spectrum gradually redshifts, and even a weak new absorption peak appears, indicating that the color of the material may change. Finally, EEF strength affects electron density, nitro charge, and chemical reactivity parameters.MethodsGaussian 16 software was used for calculation. The calculation levels are B3LYP/6-311G+ (d, p) and B3LYP/Def2-TZVPP. The optimized structure has a local true minimum energy on the potential energy surface and no imaginary frequency. Multiwfn 3.8 and VMD 1.9.3 were used in this work to analyze the ICM series of energetic material wave functions.

Revised local atomic potential method for predicting properties of energetic materials,"Aiming at energetic materials (EMs) consisting of H, C, N, and O, we revised the local atomic potential (LAP) method used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations for describing van der Waals (vdW) interaction. The revised LAPs ensure the 1/r(6) asymptotic behavior of the vdW interaction and smoothly decrease to zero in the core region. The new LAPs are based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. We applied the PBE+LAP method to calculate the densities of 19 representative EMs and compared with the PBE+D method, which is the most widely used method compromising between accuracy and efficiency for including vdW interaction in DFT calculations. The PBE+LAP method achieved mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.022 g/cm(3) from experimentally measured densities. In comparison, PBE+D method yielded 0.066 g/cm(3) MAD for the 19 EMs. The PBE+LAP method was also applied to study the polymorphism of six EMs. The results show that in five of them the PBE+LAP method can reproduce the relative stability of different polymorphs according to experiment.",2022

Predictions for Multi-Scale Shock Heating of a Granular Energetic Material,"This thesis addresses the multi scale heating of a granular energetic solid due to shock loading. To this end, an existing mathematical model that has been used to predict low pressure bulk and localized heating of the granular high-explosive HMX ([CH 2 NNO 2 ] 4 ) is extended to account for compressibility and melting of the pure phase solid. Dense granular HMX has a heterogeneous structure composed of randomly packed small grains (average size ~ 100 µm) having a free-pour density that is approximately 65% of the pure phase solid density. The shock loading response of this material is complex and consists of both bulk heating due to compression and compaction, and grain scale heating due to stress localization and plastic deformation in the vicinity of intergranular contact surfaces. Such dissipative processes at the grain scale induce high frequency temperature fluctuations (referred to as “hot-spots”) that can trigger combustion initiation even though the bulk temperature remains quite low. The work presented here is an attempt to characterize hot-spot evolution within the framework of a thermodynamically compatible bulk compaction model that can be used for engineering calculations. The model is shown to admit both steady subsonic and supersonic compaction wave structures that result in significant localized heating at the grain scale based on grain contact theory. Peak hot spot temperatures in the range of 1000 K are estimated for subsonic compaction waves that could induce combustion initiation and influence ignition sensitivity of the material. Thermal conduction and phase change are shown to be significant at low impact speeds, but become less important at higher speeds. Compressive grain heating had little effect on hot spot temperatures for the range of impact conditions considered in our study (u p = 100-1000 m/s). A parametric sensitivity analysis was performed to characterize the effect piston impact speed, initial solid volume fraction, and other key model parameters on both compaction wave structure and localized heating. At higher initial volume fractions (> 0.90), it was found that viscoelastic heating dominates over the viscoplastic heating. Also, predictions for the variation of bulk plastic strain, pressure, and porosity through the compaction zone are shown to qualitatively agree with results obtained by detailed micromechanical models.",2003
Progress in Electrohydrodynamic Atomization Preparation of Energetic Materials with Controlled Microstructures,"Constructing ingenious microstructures, such as core-shell, laminate, microcapsule and porous microstructures, is an efficient strategy for tuning the combustion behaviors and thermal stability of energetic materials (EMs). Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), which includes electrospray and electrospinning, is a facile and versatile technique that can be used to process bulk materials into particles, fibers, films and three-dimensional (3D) structures with nanoscale feature sizes. However, the application of EHDA in preparing EMs is still in its initial development. This review summarizes the progress of research on EMs prepared by EHDA over the last decade. The morphology and internal structure of the produced materials can be easily altered by varying the operation and precursor parameters. The prepared EMs composed of zero-dimensional (0D) particles, one-dimensional (1D) fibers and two-dimensional (2D) films possess precise microstructures with large surface areas, uniformly dispersed components and narrow size distributions and show superior energy release rates and combustion performances. We also explore the reasons why the fabrication of 3D EM structures by EHDA is still lacking. Finally, we discuss development challenges that impede this field from moving out of the laboratory and into practical application.",2022
Evaluation of Velocity Interferometry for High Energetic Materials Using a VISAR,"In this study, a cylinder expansion test was performed using a square prism OFHC copper with a cylindrical extrusion filled with Comp B explosive charge. A Valyn VISAR was used as a measuring tool to record the expansion history of the cylinder by Doppler shift of the light reflected off its surface, which subsequently was used to obtain the velocity history of the square prism cylinder. Quadrature fringe signals obtained from the square prism cylinder test were analysed using the results still showing some traces of fringe jumps. Whereas the hands-on calculations were more precise in correcting the jumps. This introduced some shifts in the velocity results VISAR Push-Pull reduction software and hands-on calculations. The outcome of the two velocity graphs (reduction software and manual) did not correspond. This might be due to the software velocity which caused the variation in the two velocity results. Overall, both software and manual methods resulted in velocity values that were difficult to draw conclusions from. In an attempt to further understand the test results, the displacement curve were also reduced from the velocity graphs. Although the trend of the displacement graph obtained from the reduction software is comparable to the displacement graph published in literature for the same test, the magnitudes of the values are still difficult to explain. The cylinder design used in this study was tested for the first time and numerous challenges rose up during setup and execution and are discussed. It is important for another test to be conducted with an improved setup in order to achieve a reliable interpretation of the cylinder test results.",2020
Study of tritium desorption by energetic ion bombardment from tungsten material,"To solve the problem of tritium retention in a nuclear fusion reactor, the removal of hydrogen isotopes retained in a tungsten material by exposure to the other hydrogen isotope plasma was investigated. We proposed the balance equation between the absorption and desorption of the hydrogen isotope atoms in the tungsten material. Absorption ratio and desorption yield were calculated by binary collision approximation simulation. Simulation results showed that desorption yield was proportional to the concentration of the retained hydrogen isotope. Therefore, the decrease in the retained hydrogen isotope atoms by hydrogen plasma irradiation can be regarded as approximately exponential decay. The decay rate in the case that retained deuterium atoms are removed by light hydrogen irradiation was two thirds of the decay rate in the case that retained tritium atoms are removed by deuterium irradiation.

Azide Polyether with a Highly Flexible Main Chain as Energetic Materials,"Poly(3-azidemethyl-3-methyl oxetane) (PAMMO) is an azide-containing polymer that has been widely studied, but some problems, such as its complex synthetic route, high preparation costs, and low elongation, restrict its practical applications. Therefore, it is of great significance to design and synthesize an azide polyether that is low in cost, highly flexible, and has a comparable energy level to that of PAMMO. In this paper, we synthesized an azide polyether, poly(2-azidemethyl-1,3-dioxolane) (PADOL), through a simple two-step reaction. The first step was a cationic ring-opening polymerization using 2-chloromethyl-1,3-dioxane (CDOL) as a monomer, and the second step was an azidation reaction. The synthesized PADOL had a controlled molar mass and low dispersity, and the degree of functionality of the terminal hydroxyl group was close to the theoretical value. In addition, 3,3-bisazidemethyl oxetane-2-azidemethyl-1,3-dioxolane random copolymers (PBAMO-ADOLs) were also synthesized using CDOL and 3,3-bischloromethyl oxetane (BCMO) as monomers in the same two-step reaction scheme discussed above. The copolymerization kinetics showed that the reactivity ratios of CDOL and BCMO were similar, and the copolymerization process was close to an ideal copolymerization. When the ADOL content in the PBAMO-ADOL copolymer was up to 27%, the crystallinity of the BAMO chain segment was effectively reduced, and an amorphous azide-containing polymer was obtained. Thanks to the higher oxygen content and short side chain length, PADOL exhibited a lower glass transition temperature and viscosity than PAMMO, and the prepared energetic thermoplastic elastomer (ETPE) had a higher fracture elongation. Moreover, the higher oxygen content in PADOL promoted the decomposition of the polymer backbone, resulting in a higher absolute value of the heat of combustion and lower residual carbon content.",2023
Imidazole-Based Energetic Materials: A Promising Family of ,"Imidazole represents a fascinating class of explosophoric units with exciting structures and unique properties. As compared to other nitrogen-rich heterocycles, imidazole demonstrates great potential applications due to economic effectiveness and superior energetic performances. The field of traditional chemistry has been extensively explored for imidazole, and thus established bond-building methods and functionalization strategies promote further development as high-energy density materials (HEDMs). This review addresses the development of energetic imidazole compounds in the past decade, summarizes their physiochemical properties, and is divided into three parts (explosives, propellants, and energetic biocides) according to application requirements. Various synthetic strategies for these energetic molecules are highlighted, including the construction of heterocyclic frameworks and following functionalization.

Energetic performance optimization of a coaxial phase change material (PCM) regenerator,"In the industrial sector, a large amount of energy is released at low temperatures, between 0 and 200 degrees C. To improve the overall energy efficiency of these processes, it is possible to recover this waste heat. The technology of thermal energy storage by Phase Change Materials (PCM) has appeared as one of the most economically viable methods for recovering waste heat. The PCM presents both a significant storage density and the possibility of energy restitution at a stable temperature. However, the low thermal conductivity of PCMs, specifically paraffins, limits its large-scale application. In this context, this study investigates the effect of the fins on the PCM regenerator behaviour. For that, a parametric study of the fins' number, length, thickness, and position is conducted. The volume occupied by the PCM was constant to keep the same energy density. The PCM's melting and solidification processes in a horizontal coaxial heat exchanger were numerically investigated using ANSYS Fluent commercial software. Paraffin wax with a melting point of 55 degrees C was used as PCM. The numerical study shows that the addition of longitudinal fins improves the apparent conductivity considerably and consequently reduces the melting time by up to 61%. The optimal configuration found in this study: fin number N = 4, dimensionless thickness = 0.1, dimensionless height = 0.9, and unevenly distributed fins. This configuration achieves a shorter time in completing the charging/discharging cycle of the PCM and allows a time saving of 21%.",2022
"Microbial material cycling, energetic constraints and ecosystem expansion in subsurface ecosystems","To harvest energy from chemical reactions, microbes engage in diverse catabolic interactions that drive material cycles in the environment. Here, we consider a simple mathematical model for cycling reactions between alternative forms of an element (A and A(e)), where reaction 1 converts A to A(e) and reaction 2 converts A(e) to A. There are two types of microbes: type 1 microbes harness reaction 1, and type 2 microbes harness reaction 2. Each type receives its own catabolic resources from the other type and provides the other type with the by-products as the catabolic resources. Analyses of the model show that each type increases its steady-state abundance in the presence of the other type. The flux of material flow becomes faster in the presence of microbes. By coupling two catabolic reactions, types 1 and 2 can also expand their realized niches through the abundant resource premium, the effect of relative quantities of products and reactants on the available chemical energy, which is especially important for microbes under strong energetic limitations. The plausibility of mutually beneficial interactions is controlled by the available chemical energy (Gibbs energy) of the system. We conclude that mutualistic catabolic interactions can be an important factor that enables microbes in subsurface ecosystems to increase ecosystem productivity and expand the ecosystem.",2020
"Synthesis, thermolysis, and solid spherical of RDX/PMMA energetic composite materials","To improve the safety of cryclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), a novel method for the improvement of nano-energetic materials was reported in our research. Based on the mature microcapsule technology, nano-energetic materials are firstly fabricated by using RDX as core material and poly methyl metharylate (PMMA) as shell material via an emulsion polymerization method. The RDX/PMMA nano-composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and impact sensitivity test, respectively. The SEM results indicated successful coating of the wall material PMMA on the surface of the core RDX, and the resultant particles by emulsion polymerization were regular solid spherical particles with smooth surface and dense coating layer, more importantly, it exhibits a very uniform particle size distribution with a narrower grain size. The XRD and FT-IR analyses did not show any change in the crystal structure after coating, thus indicating that PMMA could not change the crystal structure of RDX. Moreover, the characteristic height H-50 of RDX/PMMA microspheres increased from 24.3 to 39.7 cm, significantly improving the safety performance. According to the DSC analysis, the T-b after core-shell coating increased by about 2 degrees C, and the Ea increased by 19.07 kJ mol(-1), revealing desirable thermal stability. It is obvious that the emulsion polymerization method is an effective desensitization technique to prepare core-shell composite particles for RDX.",2019
Molecular dynamics simulations of void defects in the energetic material HMX,"A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out to characterize the dynamic evolution of void defects in crystalline octahydro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetranitro-1, 3, 5, 7-tetrazocine (HMX). Different models were constructed with the same concentration of vacancies (10 %) to discuss the size effects of void. Energetic ground state properties were determined by annealing simulations. The void formation energy per molecule removed was found to be 55-63 kcal/mol(-1), and the average binding energy per molecule was between 32 and 34 kcal/mol(-1) according to the change in void size. Voids with larger size had lower formation energy. Local binding energies for molecules directly on the void surface decreased greatly compared to those in defect-free lattice, and then gradually increased until the distance away from the void surface was around 10 . Analysis of 1 ns MD simulations revealed that the larger the void size, the easier is void collapse. Mean square displacements (MSDs) showed that HMX molecules that had collapsed into void present liquid structure characteristics. Four unique low-energy conformers were found for HMX molecules in void: two whose conformational geometries corresponded closely to those found in HMX polymorphs and two, additional, lower energy conformers that were not seen in the crystalline phases. The ratio of different conformers changed with the simulated temperature, in that the ratio of alpha conformer increased with the increase in temperature.",2013
Decomposition of Aminotetrazole Based Energetic Materials under High Heating Rate Conditions,"A T-jump/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (T-Jump/TOFMS) is used to probe the decomposition of several aminotetrazole containing energetic materials under very high heating rates of 10(5)-10(6) K/s. The materials investigated are 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-tetrazolium dinitramide (MeHAT_DN), 1,5-diamino-4-methyl-1H-tetrazolium dinitramide (MeDAT_DN), 1,5-diamino-1H-tetrazolium nitrate (DAT_N), 1,5-diamino-4-methyl-1H-tetrazolium azide (MeDAT_N3), and 5-aminotetrazolium dinitramide (HAT_DN). Subtle differences between materials in functional group placement and anion composition allow for further understanding of the decomposition pathway of the tetrazole structure and various anions. Two decomposition pathways for the tetrazole ring are observed, which result in the primary formation of HN3 or N-2. The N-2 formation pathway occurs when functional groups are placed symmetrically around the tetrazole ring, whereas asymmetric placement results in HN3 production. The differing anion compositions also show effects on thermal stability of the salts, as is demonstrated by a lower decomposition temperature for the azide containing salt compared to the similar dinitramide containing material. For the decomposition of the dinitramide molecule, high temperature (N2O forming) and low temperature (NO2 forming) decomposition pathways are observed, as has been previously suggested.",2012
The High-Pressure Characterization of Energetic Materials: Diaminotetrazolium Nitrate (HDAT-NO,"In-situ high-pressure room temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction and optical Raman and infrared spectroscopy were used to examine the structural properties, equation of state, and vibrational dynamics of diaminotetrazolium nitrate (HDAT-NO3)The X-ray measurements show that the pressure-volume relations remain smooth to 12 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements at pressures above 12 GPa were not possible in this study because of sample decomposition resulting from several factors. X-ray diffraction reveals no indication of a phase transition to at least 12 GPa, but slight variations in the c/b unit cell ratio suggests modifications within the hydrogen bonding sub-lattice. Vibrational measurements show the ambient phase of HDAT-NO3 to remain the dominant phase to 33 GPa.",2010
FRAGMENTATION CALCULATIONS FOR ENERGETIC IONS IN CANDIDATE SPACE RADIATION SHIELDING MATERIALS,Calculations have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of carbon- and hydrogen-rich materials for shielding against energetic heavy ions relevant to the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. Experimental work integrated with the calculations included both preparation and characterization of physical properties of candidate materials and measurements of fragmentation (breakup) of ion beams of (16)O and (40)Ar in the tens of GeV energy range in these materials. We have simulated the fragmentation experiments using both the HETC-HEDS and PHITS high-energy particle transport codes. The purposes of these computational simulations were to investigate the effectiveness as spacecraft personnel shielding of various novel as well as commercially available materials for future lunar and interplanetary missions and to validate the codes against experimental data. In the present contribution we report results of the fragmentation simulations and compare them with examples of the experimental measurements.,2009
Preparation of TATB-BTF nanocomposite energetic materials using solvent vaporizing method,"The preparation of nanocomposite energetic materials is currently a very active and exciting research area. In this paper, TATB-BTF composite particles were prepared through solvent vaporizing method, also the composite particles structure, thermal performance and mechanic sensitivity were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM),differential scanning calorimetric(DSC) and impact sensitivity experiment. The SEM images revealed that most TATB-BTF composite particles were around 200nm in diameter, these nanocomposite particles did not show visible shape change and particles size distribution became narrower and smaller compared with the original ultrafine TATB particles whose size was around 400nm. These evidence indicated that ultrafine TATB aggregations were broken up and dispersed during-the vaporization of solvent and construction of nanocomposite. The thermal decomposition experiments showed that thermal decomposition peaks of both two components forming TATB-BTF composite appeared on DSC curves. The impact sensitivity of TATB-BTF nanocomposite were significantly reduced compared with that of the physical mixture although their composition and ratio were the same.",2007
Determination of second- and third-order elastic constants for energetic materials,"Accurate calculations of second-order elastic constants (SOECs) and third-order elastic constants (TOECs) are important for energetic materials to describe the linear and nonlinear mechanical responses quantitatively. Homogeneous deformation method combined with first-principles total energy calculations are performed to calculate a complete set of SOECs and TOECs for cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (delta-HMX). The computed SOECs for RDX, PETN and delta-HMX agree well with previous experiments and theoretical calculations. Bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio deduced from SOECs reveal quantitatively the anisotropic mechanical properties along different crystal orientations. TOECs of these three energetic materials, which can be used to construct constitutive equations and provide input parameters for mesomechanics model and macroscopic simulations, are predicted. In particular, the TOEC results provide guidance for future experimental measurements and lay the foundation for more accurate calculations.",2019
Insensitive high-energy energetic structural material of tungsten-polytetrafluoroethylene-aluminum composites,"Energetic structural material is a kind of materials that are inert under normal conditions but could produce exothermic chemical reaction when subjected to impact. This report shows a kind of energetic structural material of tungsten (W)-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-aluminum (Al) with density of 4.12 g/cm(3), excellent ductility and dynamic compressive strength of 96MPa. Moreover, 50W-35PTFE-15Al (wt%) can exhibit a high reaction energy value of more than 2 times of TNT per unit mass and 5 times of TNT per unit volume, respectively, but with excellent insensitivity compared with traditional explosives. Under thermal conditions, the W-PTFE-Al composite can keep stable at 773 K. Under impact loading, when the strain rate up to similar to 4820 s(-1) coupled with the absorbed energy per unit volume of 120 J/cm(3), deflagration occurs and combustion lasts for 500 mu s. During impact compressive deformation, the PTFE matrix is elongated into nano-fibers, thus significantly increases the reaction activity of W-PTFE-Al composites. The nano-fiber structure is necessary for the reaction of W-PTFE-Al composites. The formation of PTFE nano-fibers must undergo severe plastic deformation, and therefore the W-PTFE-Al composites exhibit excellent insensitivity and safety. Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms of W-PTFE-Al composites in argon and in air are revealed. (C) 2015 Author(s).",2015
Evaluation of decomposition kinetics of energetic materials in the combustion wave,"Experimental data on burning rates and surface temperatures have been shown to allow deriving unique information on decomposition kinetics of energetic materials at high temperatures, provided combustion of these materials occurs in the condensed phase.

"Boron-based composite energetic materials (B-CEMs): Preparation, combustion and applications","Metal fuels are attractive for solid/hybrid rocket propulsion and energy-conversion applications, because of their high energy densities. Boron powder (B), due to its high gravimetric (58.30 MJ & BULL;kg(-1)) and volumetric heats of combustion (136.44 kJ & BULL;cm(-3)), is ideally one of the most promising fuel candidates for fuel-rich solid propellant (SP). However, from an application perspective, amorphous B has drawbacks of high ignition temperatures and incomplete combustion, resulting in low energy-release rate and efficiency. Thus, there is growing interest in employing B-based composite energetic materials (B-CEMs) in SP, explosives, and pyrotechnics. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the advances made over the past few decades in the areas of preparation, combustion, and applications of B-CEMs. The preparation methods of various types of B-CEMs are introduced, and the physicochemical properties of B-CEMs are systematically discussed particularly with regards to achieving advantages over B and other metal powders in a broad range of applications. The ignition and combustion behavior of different energetic formulations with B-CEMs are reviewed. Finally, the existing problems and future challenges in our understanding of the field (prospects) are discussed.",2022

Energetic Control of Redox-Active Polymers toward Safe Organic Bioelectronic Materials,"Avoiding faradaic side reactions during the operation of electrochemical devices is important to enhance the device stability, to achieve low power consumption, and to prevent the formation of reactive side-products. This is particularly important for bioelectronic devices, which are designed to operate in biological systems. While redox-active materials based on conducting and semiconducting polymers represent an exciting class of materials for bioelectronic devices, they are susceptible to electrochemical side-reactions with molecular oxygen during device operation. Here, electrochemical side reactions with molecular oxygen are shown to occur during organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) operation using high-performance, state-of-the-art OECT materials. Depending on the choice of the active material, such reactions yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive side-product, which may be harmful to the local biological environment and may also accelerate device degradation. A design strategy is reported for the development of redox-active organic semiconductors based on donor-acceptor copolymers that prevents the formation of H2O2 during device operation. This study elucidates the previously overlooked side-reactions between redox-active conjugated polymers and molecular oxygen in electrochemical devices for bioelectronics, which is critical for the operation of electrolyte-gated devices in application-relevant environments.",2020
Experimental study on impact-initiated characters of multifunctional energetic structural materials,"Multifunctional energetic structural materials (MESMs) are a new class of energetic materials, which release energy due to exothermic chemical reactions initiated under shock loading conditions. In order to analyze the impact-initiated process of MESMs, a quasi-sealed test chamber, which was originally developed by Ames [""Vented chamber calorimetry for impact-initiated energetic materials,"" in AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2005), p.279], is used to study on shock-induced chemical reaction characters at various impact velocities. The impact initiated experiments are involving two typical MESMs, Al/PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), W/Zr and inert 2024 Al fragment. The video frames recorded from reactive and inert material impact events have shown the process of late-time after burn phenomena. The total pressure and shock wave reflection at the wall of the test chamber are measured using high frequency gauges. The quasi-pressures inside the test chamber, which is fitting from the total pressure curves, are used to determine the impact initiated reaction efficiencies of MESMs at different impact velocities. A thermochemical model for shock-induced reactions, in which the reaction efficiency is considered, is validated against the experimental data from impact initiation. The results show that the impact velocity plays a significant role in chemical reaction and the energy release characteristics of MESMs. The theoretical calculations correlate reasonably well to the corresponding experimental results, which can be used to predict the reaction results of MESMs over a wide range of pressure satisfactorily.

Ignition and Extinction of Homogeneous Energetic Materials by a Light Pulse,"Numerical calculations using a model of unsteady combustion of melting energetic materials were performed to simulate the results of qualitative experiments on the ignition and quenching of energetic materials by a light pulse. The parameters of the model composition were chosen to correspond to combustion with the burning-rate control reaction in the gas phase to ensure the stability of self-sustained combustion after the cessation of irradiation. Regions of stable ignition in the coordinates ""radiant flux amplitude-irradiation time"" were obtained for compositions with different transparency for igniting pulses of three shapes: rectangular, linearly decreasing to zero, and exponentially decreasing.

Photochemical Strategies Enable the Synthesis of Tunable Azetidine-Based Energetic Materials,"Despite their favorable properties, azetidines are often overlooked as lead compounds across multiple industries. This is often attributed to the challenging synthesis of densely functionalized azetidines in an efficient manner. In this work, we report the scalable synthesis and characterization of seven azetidines with varying regio-and stereochemistry and their application as novel azetidine-based energetic materials, enabled by the visible-light-mediated aza Paterno-Buchi reaction. The performance and stark differences in the physical properties of these new compounds make them excellent potential candidates as novel solid melt-castable explosive materials, as well as potential liquid propellant plasticizers. This work highlights the scalability and utility of the visible-light aza Paterno-Buchi reaction and demonstrates the impact of stereochemical considerations on the physical properties of azetidine-based energetics. Considering the versatility and efficiency of the presented synthetic strategies, we expect that this work will guide the development of new azetidine-based materials in the energetics space as well as other industries.",2022
Energetic rigidity. II. Applications in examples of biological and underconstrained materials,"This is the second paper devoted to energetic rigidity, in which we apply our formalism to examples in two dimensions: Underconstrained random regular spring networks, vertex models, and jammed packings of soft particles. Spring networks and vertex models are both highly underconstrained, and first-order constraint counting does not predict their rigidity, but second-order rigidity does. In contrast, spherical jammed packings are overconstrained and thus first-order rigid, meaning that constraint counting is equivalent to energetic rigidity as long as prestresses in the system are sufficiently small. Aspherical jammed packings on the other hand have been shown to be jammed at hypostaticity, which we use to argue for a modified constraint counting for systems that are energetically rigid at quartic order.",2022

Heating of Energetic Materials by Continuous-Wave Near-IR Laser Radiation,"The heating of energetic materials by the radiation of fiber-coupled continuously-pumped lasers at near IR-wavelengths of 0.98, 1.56, and 1.94 mu m was studied. Samples of pressed secondary explosives and loose gunpowder were used. The length of the linear portion of the temperature rise and the rate of its rise immediately after exposure to laser radiation were measured. It was established that the rate of temperature rise at the initial time was proportional to the laser radiation power aP. For a 600 mu m diameter of the laser beam emerging from the fiber, the coefficient of proportionality a for secondary explosives was 6-250 K/(s center dot W) at a wavelength of 0.98 mu m and 40-2000 K/(s center dot W) at wavelengths of 1.56 and 1.94 mu m. For gunpowder, a = 7000-15 000 K/(s center dot W), which is an order of magnitude or more higher than that for most of the secondary explosives we studied. The possibility of increasing the efficiency of laser heating of secondary explosives by applying an absorbing thin film on the surface of the samples was studied. The heating dynamics and the initial stage of ignition of energetic materials by laser radiation were investigated.",2018
Observation of deflagration wave in energetic materials using reactive molecular dynamics,"Currently, there is no universal atomistic approach for simulating the combustion chemistry of a moving deflagration wave in condensed phase energetic materials. A reactive molecular dynamics based approach is used to identify the thermochemical events behind the formation and the propagation of a thermally initiated deflagration wave in the condensed phase RDX. The reactive molecular dynamics trajectory is mapped onto Eulerian control volumes to calculate the mass, energy and chemical flux across such deflagration front. A transition from ignition to a self-sustaining deflagration front occurs when the mass transport at the front exceeds the thermal transport in the course of propagation. Upon the formation of a self-sustaining deflagration front, a sudden rise in temperature at the front is observed accompanied by increase in the local density of the unreacted solid ahead of the front. The observed energy flux across the propagating deflagration front agrees well with the previously reported heat of explosion predictions. The deflagration front chemistry of RDX is dominated by the intermolecular and the intramolecular H-transfer reactions and subsequent formation of short-lived heavier polyradicals similar to the non-volatile residue reported in the literature. Chemical analysis indicates that the deflagration front is composed of a reactive chemical mixture of molten RDX, polyradicals and lighter intermediate radicals with intact triazine rings.

First-principles reactive molecular dynamics of chemistry in detonating energetic materials,"We investigated the initial chemistry of shock compressed energetic materials that results from inter-molecular collisions behind the shock wave front by performing first-principles MD simulations of bimolecular collisions for PETN and RDX with different crystallographic orientations and velocities. For each orientation, we determined the threshold collision velocity for reaction, the reaction timescales, and the products of decomposition. We find that the calculated threshold velocities lie within the range of typical particle flow velocities in detonating materials. Owing to the extremely short reaction timescales (similar to 10(-13) s), these initial chemical events are largely driven by the direct collision dynamics, instead of temperature.",2007
Machine-Learning a Solution for Reactive Atomistic Simulations of Energetic Materials,"Many of the safety and performance-related properties of energetic materials (EM) are related to complex condensed phase chemistry at extreme P,T conditions eluding direct experimental investigation. Atomistic simulations can play a vital role in generating insight into EM chemistry, but they rely critically on the availability of suitable interatomic potentials (""force fields""). The ChIMES machine learning approach enables generation of interatomic potentials for condensed phase reacting systems, with accuracy similar to Kohn-Sham density functional theory through its unique, highly flexible orthogonal basis set of interaction functions and systematically improvable many-body expansion of interatomic interactions. ChIMES has been successfully applied to a variety of systems including simple model energetic materials, both as a correction for simpler quantum theory and as a stand-alone interatomic potential. In this perspective, the successes and challenges of applying the ChIMES approach to the reactive molecular dynamics of energetic materials are outlined. Our machine-learned approach is general and can be applied to a variety of different application areas where atomic-level calculations can be used to help guide and elucidate experiments.",2022
"An Analytic Investigation of ""Hot-Spot"" Formation in Compressible Energetic Materials","In this paper, the formation of the shock-induced ""hot-spot"" in compressible energetic materials has been analyzed. By applying the compressible elastic-viscoplastic material model to a hollow sphere, and solving the governing equations with the initial and boundary conditions, this paper proposes an analytic pore collapse model that is able to simulate the viscoplastic deformation which determines the formation of a ""hot-spot''. In this new model there are three mechanisms, of which instantaneous deformation and the subsequent quasi-static incompressible deformation dominate ""hot-spot'' formation, while quasi-static compressible deformation is of little effect. In comparison with the incompressible solution, this model demonstrates that the bulk compressibility has a great influence on ""hot-spot"" formation, as the degree of the ""hot-spot"" reaction is a positive quasi-linear function of Poisson's ratio v. An error in Kim's original pore collapse model has also been discussed.",2017
A simple and flexible thin film evaporating device for energetic materials,"A thin film evaporation device has been developed to prepare energetic materials at atmospheric pressure.

New aspects of initiation reactivities of energetic materials demonstrated on nitramines.,"A brief survey is presented of the author's results obtained from studies of the chemical micro-mechanisms of nitramines initiation from the point of view of organic chemistry. The relationships have been presented and discussed between the characteristics of impact and electric spark sensitivities, detonation and thermal decomposition, on the one hand, and (15)N NMR chemical shifts of nitrogen atoms of nitramino groups, on the other. In the case of the impact sensitivity, the said relationships involve the (15)N shifts of the amino nitrogen atoms carrying the nitro group primarily split off from the molecule. In the case of the initiation by shock, heat and electric spark, the (15)N shifts of nitrogen atoms in the primarily split off nitro groups themselves are involved. Also, the relationships are presented between the characteristics of thermal reactivity and values of the electronic charges at the nitro groups that are primarily split off. It has been stated that the chemical micro-mechanisms of primary fission processes of molecules of nitramines in the initiation by mechanical stimuli (inclusive the detonation course) and electric spark should be the same as in the case of their low-temperature thermal decomposition. It has been found that the electron structure and close neighbourhood of nitrogen atom of the primarily leaving nitro group is a dominant factor in initiation by shock, electric spark and heat. In the case of initiation by impact a key role plays characteristics of amino nitrogen atoms which are carriers of these most reactive nitro groups. Also mentioned is relevance of the modified Evans-Polanyi-Semenov relationship. On the basis of the findings presented it also has been stated that the detonation transformation itself of the nitramines should be preceded by an induction period.",y-20
Tetrazole-functionalized microcrystalline cellulose: A promising biopolymer for advanced energetic materials,"In the present work, we report on the synthesis of new class of nitrogen-rich energetic polymers based on tetrazole-acetate modification of pristine cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose, as well as their nitrated derivatives. All compounds were fully characterized using series of analytical tools. Furthermore, the detonation properties of the nitrated polymers were predicted using the EXPLO5 V6.04 computer code. Their heats of combustion and sensitivity characteristics against impact and friction were also evaluated. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the performed chemical modification to synthesize nitrated tetrazole-acetate-functionalized cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose from their precursors, with great nitrogen contents, elevated densities, good thermal stability, interesting detonation properties, and low sensitivity characteristics compared to conventional nitrocellulose and emergent microcrystalline cellulose nitrate. Therefore, this investigation provides a novel and sustainable methodology to develop promising high-energy dense materials from natural products, which may further promote their use as new nitrogen-rich energetic polymers in composite explosives and high-performance solid propellants.",2020
Investigating Orientational Defects in Energetic Material RDX Using First-Principles Calculations,"Orientational defects are molecular-scale point defects consisting of misaligned sterically trapped molecules. Such defects have been predicted in alpha-RDX using empirical force fields. These calculations indicate that their concentration should be higher than that of vacancies. In this study we confirm the stability of a family of four orientational defects in alpha-RDX using first-principles calculations and evaluate their formation energies and annealing barrier heights. The charge density distribution in the defective molecules is evaluated and it is shown that all four orientational defects exhibit some level of charge reduction at the midpoint of the N-N bond, which has been previously related to the sensitivity to initiation of the material. We also evaluate the vibrational spectrum of the crystal containing orientational defects and observe band splitting relative to the perfect crystal case. This may assist the experimental identification of such defects by Raman spectroscopy.",2016
HOT-SPOT FORMATION IN ENERGETIC MATERIALS CONFINED IN WAVY-ROUGH DOMAINS,We obtain very-high temperature profiles that resemble hot spots after numerically tuning the geometric as well as material parameters. Approximate solutions for steady temperature distribution of exotic materials with temperature-dependent thermal absorptivities inside microannuli with small amplitude wavy-rough surfaces were derived considering a quasilinear partial differential equation by the boundary perturbation approach. Our results can give useful clues about the storage of solid fuels as well as energy creation via fine-tuned hot-spot formation.,2015
Three-dimensional simulations of dynamics of void collapse in energetic materials,"This work presents the response of a porous heterogeneous energetic material subjected to severe loading conditions. Spherical voids are embedded in an otherwise homogeneous material with the mechanical properties of condensed phase explosives. The effect of imposed shocks on spherical (three-dimensional) voids is compared with the cylindrical (two-dimensional) voids studied in an earlier work, in terms of energy deposition and the maximum temperature reached in the material as the void collapses. It is observed that there is a significant rise in maximum temperature of the energetic material in the presence of spherical voids compared to cylindrical voids. In addition to increasing the maximum temperature, the three-dimensional effects also influence the energy distribution as the void collapses. This study also compares mutual void-void interactions by analyzing different relative positions between two voids for both cylindrical and spherical shapes. Apart from the comparison, this study reinforces the importance of micro-scale dynamics in understanding and quantifying the response of an energetic material to shock loading.",2015

Advances in science and technology of modern energetic materials: An overview,"Energetic materials such as explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics are widely used for both civilian and military explosives applications. The present review focuses briefly on the synthesis aspects and some of the physico-chemical properties of energetic materials of the class: (a) aminopyridine-N-oxides, (b) energetic azides, (c) high nitrogen content energetic materials, (d) imidazoles, (e) insensitive energetic materials, (f) oxidizers, (g) nitramines, (h) nitrate esters and (i) thermally stable explosives. A brief comment is also made on the emerging nitration concepts. This paper also reviews work done on primary explosives of current and futuristic interest based on energetic co-ordination compounds. Lead-free co-ordination compounds are the candidates of tomorrow's choice in view of their additional advantage of being eco-friendly. Another desirable attribute of lead free class of energetic compounds is the presence of almost equivalent quantity of fuel and oxidizer moieties. These compounds may find wide spectrum of futuristic applications in the area of energetic materials. The over all aim of the high energy materials research community is to develop the more powerful energetic materials/explosive formulations/propellant formulations in comparison to currently known benchmark materials/compositions. Therefore, an attempt is also made to highlight the important contributions made by the various researchers in the frontier areas energetic ballistic modifiers, energetic binders and energetic plasticizers.

Performance of Dispersion-Inclusive Density Functional Theory Methods for Energetic Materials,"Molecular crystals of energetic materials (EMs) are denser than typical molecular crystals and are characterized by distinct intermolecular interactions between nitrogen-containing moieties. To assess the performance of dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) methods, we have compiled a data set of experimental sublimation enthalpies of 31 energetic materials. We evaluate the performance of three methods: the semilocal Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional coupled with the pairwise Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) dispersion correction, PBE with the many-body dispersion (MBD) method, and the PBE-based hybrid functional (PBE0) with MBD. Zero-point energy contributions and thermal effects are described using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), including explicit treatment of thermal expansion, which we find to be non-negligible for EMs. The lattice energies obtained with PBE0+MBD are the closest to experimental sublimation enthalpies with a mean absolute error of 9.89 kJ/mol. However, the state-of-the-art treatment of vibrational and thermal contributions makes the agreement with experiment worse. Pressure-volume curves are also examined for six representative materials. For pressure-volume curves, all three methods provide reasonable agreement with experimental data with mean absolute relative errors of 3% or less. Most of the intermolecular interactions typical of EMs, namely nitro-amine, nitronitro, and nitro-hydrogen interactions, are more sensitive to the choice of the dispersion method than to the choice of the exchangecorrelation functional. The exception is pi-pi stacking interactions, which are also very sensitive to the choice of the functional. Overall, we find that PBE+TS, PBE+MBD, and PBE0+MBD do not perform as well for energetic materials as previously reported for other classes of molecular crystals. This highlights the importance of testing dispersion-inclusive DFT methods for diverse classes of materials and the need for further method development.",

Thermal and Radiative Transport Analysis of Laser Ignition of Energetic Materials,"Laser ignition of energetic materials is an attractive technology for replacement of low energy electro-explosive devices which pose a safety hazard. The development of this technology has historically been based on go/no-go threshold testing using off-the-shelf laser diodes and solid state lasers. Here we seek to build a more fundamental understanding of the laser ignition process by analyzing the interactions and response of the energetic material to the incident laser beam. We begin with a radiative heat transfer model of the laser-beam-assisted heating of a homogeneous energetic material with given optical properties. An analytical solution of the 2-flux model equations is developed and this expression for the volumetric absorption of laser energy in an absorbing and isotropically scattering medium is coupled to the conservation of energy equation. Two limiting cases-minimum power and minimum energy thresholds for ignition-are discussed, and the minimum energy threshold is calculated directly from the energy equation in the limit of zero dissipative losses. The effects of power density and beam shape are of particular interest and two common configurations are analyzed. Although the applicability of thermal models is limited by large uncertainties in the optical properties of energetic materials, the analysis provides a qualitative understanding of the ignition process and a correlation between ignition thresholds and the various material properties and design parameters.",2010
Contemporary methods to measure regression rate of energetic materials: A review,"Various energetic materials, including solid rocket propellants, have found numerous applications in aerospace technology in the past decades. This growing interest initiated an increasing number of experimental and technological studies, leading to a wide range of published experimental data. Due to the intrinsic challenges of data acquisition and processing, assessing the accuracy of the measurement results is important. In this paper, a review of existing experimental techniques for measuring the regression rate of energetic materials is presented along with a description of the fundamental physical principles used for developing the particular methods. Special attention is paid to recent developments in measurements of highly-dynamic processes. Technical requirements for correct determination of regression rate are analyzed focusing on the methods associated with transient combustion. Emphasis is placed on laboratory-scale methods intended to obtain correct and reliable data on regression rate in well-characterized environments that can be used for comparison with theoretical predictions. The measurement methods are divided into direct and indirect ones. It is shown that direct highspeed photography could not be effectively used for recording regression rate oscillations with frequencies higher than 30-50 Hz. The same limitation applies to classical ultrasound techniques and X-ray radiography. However, radiography techniques based on synchrotron and terahertz radiation are promising. Special attention is paid to development of microwave and laser recoil methods that provide high spatial and temporal resolution capable of correctly determining transient regression rate.",2022
Structural Health Monitoring of Nanocomposite Bonded Energetic Materials Through Piezoresistive Response,"The application of in situ structural health monitoring in polymer bonded explosive materials through the introduction of carbon nanotubes into the binder phase is investigated through piezoresistive response under quasi-static loading, to provide the basis for deformation and damage sensing for real-time self-diagnostic functionalities in energetic materials. The experimental effort herein is focused on inert energetics using 70 wt % ammonium perchlorate and mock energetics using 70 wt % sugar crystals embedded into epoxy binder, having concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 wt % multiwalled carbon nanotubes relative to the entire hybrids. Electrical conductivity, dielectric properties, mechanical properties, and piezoresistive sensitivities of inert and mock energetics are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Electrical conductivity and dielectric constant were improved similar to 3 and similar to 5, and similar to 1 and similar to 2, orders of magnitude for 0.1 and 0.5 wt % multiwalled carbon nanotube inert hybrid energetics and mock hybrid energetics from that of the baseline neat inert energetics and neat mock energetics, respectively. Incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes into local binder improved tensile modulus of ammonium perchlorate inert hybrid energetics and sugar mock hybrid energetics, similar to 15 and similar to 70%, respectively, and tensile strength of sugar mock hybrid energetics similar to 40% compared with neat inert energetics and neat mock energetics. Significant piezoresistive response was obtained both for multiwalled carbon nanotube ammonium perchlorate inert hybrid energetics and multiwalled carbon nanotube sugar mock hybrid energetics, demonstrating the electromechanical characterization of inert and mock energetic materials, which provides proof of concept for strain and damage sensing under quasi-static loading for real-time structural health monitoring in energetics.",2018
Assembly of Nitrofurazan and Nitrofuroxan Frameworks for High-Performance Energetic Materials,"The design of novel energetic materials with improved performance, optimized parameters, and environmental compatibility remains a challenging task. In this study, new high-energy materials based on isomeric dinitrobi-1,2,5-oxadiazole structures comprising nitrofurazan and nitrofuroxan subunits were synthesized. Due to planarity and strong noncovalent interactions, these materials display high density values as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal, impact, and friction sensitivities of both isomers are similar to that of nitroesters. Their high detonation performance along with the combined benefits of high density, high heat of formation, and good oxygen balance make the synthesized compounds promising as explosives and highly-energetic oxidizers.",2017
Titanium Oxysulfate as a Colorimetric Sensor for Peroxide-Based Energetic Materials,"The design, development, and evaluation of a non-contact detection method for hydrogen peroxide and triacetone triperoxide has been completed using titanium oxysulfate colorimetric sensor. The investigation into the detection method involved the development of a set of software tools to evaluate the time rate of change of the color for the titanium oxysulfate sensor is presented. A commercial off-the-shelf color camera was used to capture a time series of images of the sensor while exposed to various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ranged up to 30wt% to determine the range of color changes for the titanium oxysulfate sensor over an exposure period of 2 hours, with images captured at one minute time intervals. The captured images contain information about the affects on the visible light spectrum from the sensor’s color change. Analysis of the spectrum information revealed the color change of the sensor preferentially absorbs the shorter wavelengths of the visible light spectrum. This non-contact detection method is demonstrated for hydrogen peroxide and was successfully applied to various weights of triacetone triperoxide. The sensor is capable of detecting the vapors of hydrogen peroxide within 5 minutes of exposure, while detection of triacetone triperoxide vapors occurred within 6–7 minutes of exposure. The effective rate of color change of the sensor with triacetone triperoxide is comparable to the effective rate of color change of the sensor with 20wt% hydrogen peroxide. The lower detection limits for titanium oxysulfate are concentrations of 8.4 * 10 −9 g / cm 3 for hydrogen peroxide and 1 * 10 −6 g / cm 3 for TATP.

Surface enhanced raman spectroscopy for ultra-sensitive detection of energetic materials,"The prospect of ultra-sensitive detection of molecular species, particularly those of energetic materials, has prompted the present research initiative. The combination of metal surface nano-technology and Raman spectroscopy has given rise to ‘Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy’ (SERS). This is a very sensitive technique and has proved to be capable of detecting a single molecule. SERS was demonstrated by recording Raman spectra of the sample molecules adsorbed on various specially prepared SER-active surfaces both in the form of a colloidal suspension and on the solid roughened surfaces. Using a gold colloidal suspension, pyridine has been detected down to 10-11 molar (M) concentration. A silver slab was roughened to a dimension of a nano-scale by etching in nitric acid solution to make SER-active surface. Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) explosive was detected using this surface after its 10-2 M solution was dropped, dried and washed (of any residue) from the surface. Lithographically engineered silver structures in the form of nanoarrays having a number of silver structures of approximately 106 in a region of 0.1 mm2 have been used for SERS. The major noise contribution to the scattering from impurities in an ordinary glass substrate has been eliminated by replacing glasses as substrates with pure quartz discs. The headspace vapours from peroxide explosives, Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) and Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD), were detected at approximately 70 parts per million (ppm) and 0.3 ppm concentrations respectively using a portable commercial Raman Spectrometer. PETN was also detected from its headspace vapour at about 18 parts per trillion (ppt) in spite of it having a much lower vapour pressure. The possibility of desorption of adsorbed molecules from a nano-structured surface by laser irradiation has been demonstrated experimentally with the aim of reusability of SER-active surfaces. Also demonstrated was the enhancement in Raman intensity through resonance Raman effect spectroscopy for the future use in surface enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS).",2007
"Asymmetrically substituted 5,5′-bistriazoles - nitrogen-rich materials with various energetic functionalities","In this contribution the synthesis and full structural and spectroscopic characterization of three asymmetrically substituted bis-1,2,4-triazoles, along with different energetic moieties like amino, nitro, nitrimino and azido moieties, is presented. Additionally, selected nitrogen-rich ionic derivatives have been prepared and characterized. This comparative study on the influence of these energetic moieties on structural and energetic properties constitutes a complete characterization including IR, Raman and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray crystallographic measurements were performed and provide insight into structural characteristics as well as inter-and intramolecular interactions. The standard enthalpies of formation were calculated for all compounds at the CBS-4M level of theory, revealing highly positive heats of formation for all compounds. The detonation parameters were calculated using the EXPLO5 program and compared to the common secondary explosive RDX as well as recently published symmetric bistriazoles. As expected, the measured sensitivities to mechanical stimuli and decomposition temperatures strongly depend on the energetic moiety of the triazole ring. All compounds were characterized in terms of sensitivities (impact, friction, electrostatic) and thermal stabilities, the ionic derivatives were found to be thermally stable, insensitive compounds.",2013
The Application of Godunov SPH in the Simulation of Energetic Materials,"The numerical study of detonation of high explosives has been the interest of researchers over decades. Due to its special advantages in tracking free surface and dealing with large deformation, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been a powerful tool to investigate detonation phenomenon. SPH is a Lagrangian mesh-free method with extensive applications in fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. In the early development of SPH method, artificial viscosity is introduced to suppress unphysical fluctuation. However, the parameters of artificial viscosity often need to be tuned for some simulation, which can be quite time-consuming. Herein, a Riemann solver is integrated in traditional SPH algorithm to eliminate artificial viscosity, which is known as Godunov SPH. First, shock tube problem is studied using the Godunov SPH. The simulation result is compared with that obtained by traditional SPH with artificial viscosity, finite volume method (FVM) and experiment. Then, the Godunov SPH is implemented to investigate the detonation of ID and 2D polymer-bonded explosive PIBX 9501. Various factors that may influence simulation are studied, such as particle density and smoothing length. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is accurate and reliable for the study of detonation of high explosives.",2020
Simulation guided experimental interface shock viscosity measurement in an energetic material,"Experimental measurements of interface shock viscosity in hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-ammonium perchlorate (AP) material system are performed using mechanical Raman spectroscopy (MRS) combined with laser pulse shock loading. First, HTPB-AP interface level shock wave propagation is studied using the cohesive finite element method. The difference in the shock behavior of the analyzed HTPB-AP interfaces from that of the bulk AP and HTPB material is highlighted by numerical simulations of impacting a single AP particle in an HTPB-AP sample in three different ways: (1) a flyer plate is used to impact the whole HTPB-AP sample; (2) a flat impacter is used to impact the middle of AP particle embedded in HTPB matrix directly; and (3) a HTPB-AP interface is directly impacted with an impacter of radius 1 mu m. Shock wave rise time at the interface is shown to differ for the three different impact modes. Based on the simulation results, a combined MRS and pulse laser-induced particle impact test is used for measuring shock viscosity at HTPB-AP interfaces. It is observed that by changing the chemical composition of the interface, shock viscosity can be altered. A modified finite element model with viscous stress based on shock viscosity values added to the stress equation is then used for the shock impact simulation of an HTPB-AP material system. A power law relation was obtained between shock wave rise time and the shock viscosity.",2019
Laser Initiation of Energetic Materials: Selective Photoinitiation Regime in Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate,"We describe and analyze the selective (resonance) laser-induced initiation of chemical decomposition reactions in pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, C5H8N4O12) and propose a potential mechanism for the phenomenon. On the basis of our experiments, the photoinitiation of PETN is a two-stage process that is comprised of a laser-induced optical excitation of the molecule with an activation energy of 1.17 eV (1060 nm) by a neodymium phosphate glass laser followed by the thermal decomposition of the excited state with an energy barrier of 0.4 eV. We also illustrate that the small efficiency of the optical absorption of PETN at this wavelength can be enhanced by the MgO light-scattering additives, which significantly increase the absorption clue to multiple scattering incidents in PETN. The resonance photoinitiation clearly demonstrates a possibility for designing tunable explosive material systems and identifies ways to control the sensitivity of the materials to rapid decomposition.",2011
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF A NEW ENERGETIC MATERIAL SI-PETN,"A new energetic material Si-PETN, having a structure similar to that of PETN, has recently been synthesized (T.M. Klapotke et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 6908 (2007)) and shown to exhibit extreme instability that has precluded investigation of its physical and chemical properties by experiment. Although its high instability prohibits its use in munitions, Si-PETN could provide valuable information about the nature of sensitivity in energetic materials. Because the properties for Si-PETN are currently unknown, first-principles van-der-Waals density functional theory was used to obtain the equation of state under hydrostatic compression and mechanical properties under uniaxial compressions. These properties were then compared to those of PETN.",2009
Equation of state & failure criteria of dual functional structural energetic materials,"A specific dual functional material that consists of a mixture of nickel, aluminum and a binder is characterized. This is a mixture and not an alloy or a compound. The potential dual functions offered by this material consist of the strength and energetic characteristics. A first step in characterizing the material is the determination of the thermodynamically complete equation of state P=P(rho,T) from first principles, without the binder. A supercell. approach, similar to the virtual crystal approximation, and first principle methods are used first to obtain the EOS of the mixture. Then, the question of failure criteria is addressed. The dual functional materials have dual branches of failure criteria: mechanical and chemical reaction based failure criteria. In this paper, the chemical reaction based failure criterion is discussed using an ab initio molecular dynamics approach.",2007
Prediction and Construction of Energetic Materials Based on Machine Learning Methods,"Energetic materials (EMs) are the core materials of weapons and equipment. Achieving precise molecular design and efficient green synthesis of EMs has long been one of the primary concerns of researchers around the world. Traditionally, advanced materials were discovered through a trial-and-error processes, which required long research and development (R&D) cycles and high costs. In recent years, the machine learning (ML) method has matured into a tool that compliments and aids experimental studies for predicting and designing advanced EMs. This paper reviews the critical process of ML methods to discover and predict EMs, including data preparation, feature extraction, model construction, and model performance evaluation. The main ideas and basic steps of applying ML methods are analyzed and outlined. The state-of-the-art research about ML applications in property prediction and inverse material design of EMs is further summarized. Finally, the existing challenges and the strategies for coping with challenges in the further applications of the ML methods are proposed.",2023
The Thermomechanical Response of Particulate Composite Energetic Materials Under Mechanical Vibration,"Polymer-bonded, particulate composite energetic materials are widely used in the defense and energy sectors for munitions systems and explosive devices, yet their thermomechanical behavior is not well understood. In this work, the macroscale, thermomechanical response of energetic materials to contact mechanical excitation was studied at frequencies spanning 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The effects of formulation variation, thermal boundary conditions, excitation amplitude, and intentional stress concentrations within large composite plate samples were examined when the samples were excited at various resonances. Initial experiments focused primarily on the first structural resonance of a plate geometry, as determined experimentally using laser Doppler vibrometry. Excitation at frequencies up to 1000 Hz resulted in heating, attributable to the viscoelastic nature of the polymeric binder, on the order of 2-3◦C/hr, and the propagation of structural defects such as cracks. At frequencies above 10 kHz, the heat generation within the material increased, potentially due to a combination of viscoelastic heating, particle / binder interactions, and conduction with exterior mounting components. Experiments were performed utilizing laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography on both inert and fully-loaded energetic material variants in order to analyze the thermal and mechanical response due to the mechanical excitation using a piezoelectric shaker. The thermal analysis of various sample formulations revealed temperature changes on the order of 4◦C/min, with several samples reaching 100◦C within a 15 min window. Due to significant material softening observed during the thermal cycling, the resonant frequency was found to shift over the course of the experimental analysis. Potential applications may require the energetic materials to sustain extreme temperature environments coupled with vibratory loads. In an effort to characterize this effect, a custom enclosure was fabricated to maintain an ambient air temperature around the sample of up to 70◦C. Distinctions between ambient and elevated temperature environment experiments on a preliminary sample set were noted in regard to rate of change of temperature, and several samples exhibited maximum surface temperatures in excess of 100◦C. Finally, an analytical model was developed to estimate the heat generation associated with the observed experimental results. The cylindrical sample geometry was modeled as a longitudinal rod subjected to harmonic base excitation, and the resulting mechanical response was used to estimate the rate of mechanical energy expended per unit length at the predicted resonant frequencies. The thermal response was obtained by numerical integration of the heat transfer equation accounting for energy generation in the system, and the resulting axial temperature profiles predicted maximum temperatures on the order of 120◦C after 60 seconds of excitation at the first predicted resonant frequency.",2019
Diffuse Interface Methods for Multiple Phase Materials: An Energetic Variational Approach,"In this paper, we introduce a diffuse interface model for describing the dynamics of mixtures involving multiple (two or more) phases. The coupled hydrodynamical system is derived through an energetic variational approach. The total energy of the system includes the kinetic energy and the mixing (interfacial) energies. The least action principle (or the principle of virtual work) is applied to derive the conservative part of the dynamics, with a focus on the reversible part of the stress tensor arising from the mixing energies. The dissipative part of the dynamics is then introduced through a dissipation function in the energy law, in line with Onsager's principle of maximum dissipation. The final system, formed by a set of coupled time-dependent partial differential equations, reflects a balance among various conservative and dissipative forces and governs the evolution of velocity and phase fields. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a few two-dimensional simulations have been carried out, including (1) the force balance at the three-phase contact line in equilibrium, (2) a rising bubble penetrating a fluid-fluid interface, and (3) a solid particle falling in a binary fluid. The effects of slip at solid surface have been examined in connection with contact line motion and a pinch-off phenomenon.",2015

"Synthesis and Characteristics of Energetic Materials Based on 1,2-Dinitroguanidine","A series of energetic salts based on 1,2-dinitroguanidine were successfully synthesised and fully characterised using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that all the salts possess higher detonation properties (detonation pressures and velocities ranging from 24.8 to 30.3 GPa and 7665 to 8422 m s(-1), respectively) than those of trinitrotolouene (TNT, 2,4,6-trinitromethylbenzene). The thermal stability and thermal kinetic parameters were also investigated to give a better understanding of the physical and chemical properties of these energetic salts.",2014
Energetic analysis of cutting mechanisms in belt finishing of hard materials,"Belt finishing has been tested successfully as a complementary process to hard turning. This technology improves the surface texture and generates compressive residual stress. However, the mechanisms and characteristics of this new process have not yet been fully explained. This article provides a comprehensive characterization of cutting mechanisms generated by belt finishing. First, an analytical analysis based on cutting forces is developed. Then, the macroscopic specific energy is dissociated into a cutting specific energy responsible of shearing and ploughing mechanisms and a sliding specific energy due to adhesion. It has been demonstrated that cutting is more predominant than sliding in belt finishing process. The omnipresence of cutting demonstrates the effectiveness and the profitability of belt finishing operation.",2013
The development of a future chemical compatibility standard for energetic materials,"To ensure safety and reliability, it is important that the explosives and other materials used in munitions do not interact adversely either physically or chemically. Data obtained by heat flow calorimetry on nitrocellulose-based propellants have been reviewed with the aim of identifying improved chemical compatibility assessment criteria. It was shown that relative and absolute assessment techniques could give contrary sentencing. It was concluded that basing the assessment on the absolute criteria would have the advantage that alternative test temperatures and durations could be utilised. After 7 days at 85 degrees C the increase in the absolute heat flow of the mixture should be < 15 J g(-1) in order to be assessed as compatible. The assessment of compatibility is complex and improved sentencing results from additional testing at different temperatures to establishing the Arrhenius data and/or chemical analysis to understand the reactions contributing to the heat flow.",2019
Effect of energetic materials wettability on their outdoor effective elution rate,"Energetic materials (EM) contained in military ammunitions have been found in the surface soil and water of training areas and may potentially represent a threat to human health and the environment. EM wettability is an essential physical parameter to characterize because it controls EM dissolution rate. This paper was conducted to determine the wettability of conventional and new EM formulations used in military ammunition. Wettability was estimated in the laboratory via contact angle measurements of water droplets on different EM surfaces. Results show that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), Octol and energetic thermoplastic elastomer (ETPE) 1000 are hydrophilic while Composition B, XRT, GIM, CX-85, ETPE 2000, and C4 are hydrophobic whereas HELOVA gun propellant has a mixed wettability oscillating between hydrophilic and hydrophobic. The present study demonstrates that wettability of EM formulation is generally controlled by their matrix constituents. Results indicate that hydrophobic formulations have a much slower outdoor environmental effective elution rate than hydrophilic ones, with the exception of the hydrophobic C4 formulation whose elution rate is extremely high. The addition of hydrophobic components into EM formulations is recommended to diminish the environmental impact on water, as it has already been done with XRT, GIM and CX-85 formulations.

Fracture Characterization of High-Density Polyethylene Materials Using the Energetic Criterias,"Impact behavior of polymers has received considerable attention in recent years, and much work based on fracture mechanic approaches has been carried out. In this paper, fracture behavior in large deformation of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) materials was investigated through experimental impact testing on single edge notched specimen (SENB) and by using theoretical and analytical fracture criteria concepts. Moreover, a review of the main fracture criteria is given in order to characterize the toughness of this polymer in the both cases (static and dynamic). The fractured specimens obtained from the Charpy impact test were characterized with respect to their fracture surfaces. Characteristic zones of the fracture surface can be assigned to different stages and mechanisms of the fracture process. Finally, for a better understanding of fracture and damage mechanisms and to provide the best estimation of fracture toughness in impact, an experimental approach based on microscopic observations (SEM) was used.",2016
Polynitro-substituted bispyrazoles: a new family of high-performance energetic materials,"New polynitro-substituted bispyrazoles were synthesised and fully characterised in this study. Ammonium 4-(4'-amino-3',5'-dinitro-1'-pyrazol)-3,5-dinitropyrazole (3), 4-(4'-amino-3',5'-dinitro-1'-pyrazol)-1-amino-3,5-initropyrazole (6), diaminoguanidinium 4-(4'-amino-3',5'-dinitro-11-pyrazol)-3,5-dinitropyrazole (9), and 3,4,5-triamino-1,2,4-triazolium 4-(4'-amino-3',5'-dinitro-1'-pyrazol)-3,5-dinitropyrazole (12) were further confirmed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compounds exhibited excellent thermal stabilities, insensitivities and high detonation performance. The measured LC50 of the compounds suggested that their toxicities were lower than that of TNT and that for compound 3 even lower than that of TATB. Compound 5 demonstrates unprecedented overall performance: higher detonation velocity (V-D = 8760-8981 m s(-1)), detonation heat (Q(v) = 7551 kJ kg(-1)) and explosive power (A = 1712 kJ g(-1)) than RDX, a decomposition temperature (T-d = 297 degrees C) higher than that of HMX, and much lower toxicity (LC50 = 7 mu g mL(-1)) than that of TNT, ranking it in a new generation of heat resistant, less sensitive and low environmental impact high energetic materials.",2014
Exploration of the Hydrogen-Bonded Energetic Material Carbohydrazide at High Pressures,"We have reported the high-pressure behavior of hydrogen bonded energetic material carbohydrazide (CON4H6, CHZ) via in-situ Raman spectroscopy and angle dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) in a diamond anvil cell with similar to 15 GPa at room temperature. Significant changes in Raman spectra provide evidence for a pressue-induced structural phase transition in the range of similar to 8 to 10.5 GPa ADXRD experiments confirm this phase transition by symmetry transformation from P2(1)/n to a possible space group P (1) over bar, which exhibits similar to 23.1% higher density at 10.1 GPa compared to phase P2(1)/n at ambient pressure. Moreover, the observed transition is completely reversible when the pressure is totally released. On the basis of the decreased number of hydrogen bonds, the shortened hydrogen bond lengths, and the variations in the NH and NH2 stretching Raman peaks in the high pressure phase, we propose that this phase transition is caused by the rearrangement of the hydrogen-based networks.",2014
Nanoscale Aluminum-Metal Oxide (Thermite) Reactions for Application in Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials find use in both military and civilian applications, however many commonly used materials suffer from serious deficiencies including toxicity and high sensitivity.

"Highly Reactive Thermite Energetic Materials: Preparation, Characterization, and Applications: A Review","As a promising kind of functional material, highly reactive thermite energetic materials (tEMs) with outstanding reactive activation can release heat quickly at a high reaction rate after low-energy stimulation, which is widely used in sensors, triggers, mining, propellants, demolition, ordnance or weapons, and space technology. Thus, this review aims to provide a holistic view of the recent progress in the development of multifunctional highly reactive tEMs with controllable micro/nano-structures for various engineering applications via different fabricated techniques, including the mechanical mixing method, vapor deposition method, assembly method, sol-gel method, electrospinning method, and so on.

"Assembling Nitrogen-rich, thermally Stable, and insensitive energetic materials by polycyclization","In pursuit of energetic materials which have equal energies and thermal stabilities, but lower sensitivities compared with hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7tetrazocine (HMX), a new fused N-heterocyclic framework, ditriazolo-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, 7 was designed and synthesized. Compound 7 exhibits a favorable decomposition temperature of 247 C benefiting from its good aromaticity which was studied by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) and isochemical shielding surfaces (ICSS). Combined with moderate detonation properties (vD, 8544 m s(-1); P, 27.3 GPa) and low sensitivities (IS, > 40 J; FS, > 360 N), 7 may potentially be useful as a secondary energetic in practical applications to replace RDX. Hydrazinium salt 12 has a thermal stability of 221 C, and excellent detonation properties (vD, 9088 m s(-1) ; P, 32.3 GPa), which are comparable with those of HMX. These contributions highlight the fused N-heterocyclic framework as a potential energetic backbone and provide new thinking to the chemistry of polycyclic heterocycles.",2022
Thermal properties of energetic materials from quasi-harmonic first-principles calculations,"The structure and properties at a finite temperature are critical to understand the temperature effects on energetic materials (EMs). Combining dispersion-corrected density functional theory with quasi-harmonic approximation, the thermodynamic properties for several representative EMs, including nitromethane, PETN, HMX, and TATB, are calculated. The inclusion of zero-point energy and temperature effect could significantly improve the accuracy of lattice parameters at ambient condition; the deviations of calculated cell volumes and experimental values at room temperature are within 0.62%. The calculated lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients with increasing temperature show strong anisotropy. In particular, the expansion rate (2.61%) of inter-layer direction of TATB is higher than intra-layer direction and other EMs. Furthermore, the calculated heat capacities could reproduce the experimental trends and enrich the thermodynamic data set at finite temperatures. The predicted isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli could reflect the softening behavior of EMs. These results would fundamentally provide a deep understanding and serve as a reference for the experimental measurement of the thermodynamic parameters of EMs.",2021
Modeling Sensitivities of Energetic Materials using the Python Language and Libraries,"Assessing the value of new compounds as components of energetic materials requires the determination of a significant amount of data, including sensitivities to various stimuli. Unfortunately, the dependence of these properties on molecular structure is still poorly understood. In view of estimating their values for putative high energy molecules, standard quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodologies are widely used. In doing so, a special focus is put on standard descriptors and formalisms. To foster further progress through consideration of alternative approaches, this article emphasizes how the Python language and associated libraries make it straightforward to implement arbitrary models, including schemes a la Keshavarz based on the occurrences of highly specific molecular fragments as well as the non-linear expressions naturally arising from physics-based approaches to sensitivities. Two previously published models are implemented for illustrative purposes. The first one is a simple fragment-based equation for electric spark sensitivity of nitroarenes. The second one is a model for impact sensitivity of general molecular energetic materials. In each case a Python implementation is provided as supporting information and may be used as is or serve as a template to implement alternative schemes.",2020
Pulsed laser deposition: Energetic growth effects in Group IV semiconductor materials,"Pulsed laser deposition is characterized by a broad deposition energy distribution with a mean energy of a few eV or a few tens of eV. The research that comprises this thesis was motivated by a desire to characterize energetic growth effects in pulsed laser deposition of Group IV semiconductor materials in order to understand and manipulate fundamental growth kinetics. This research specifically focuses on energetic effects in growth morphology, in growth on hydrogen-terminated surfaces, and in alloy growth. In Chapter 1, pulsed laser deposition is introduced. In Chapter 2, simulated growth morphologies for Si growth by molecular beam deposition, sputter deposition, and pulsed laser deposition are compared. Feature atom displacement, an energetic effect, was found to significantly decrease roughness at low substrate temperatures. Pulsed roughening, a temporal effect, was found to slightly increase roughness at high substrate temperatures. In Chapter 3, crystalline Si grown by pulsed laser deposition on dihydride-terminated Si (001) surfaces and by molecular beam deposition and sputter deposition on clean Si (001) surfaces are compared. H transfer and Si subplantation, two energetic effects, were found to enable crystalline growth on dihydride-terminated Si (001) surfaces. In Chapter 4, crystalline $m Sn\sb{x}Ge\sb{1-x}$ grown by solid phase epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition are compared. Solid phase epitaxy was found to produce alloys with compositions no larger than approximately 0.05. Pulsed laser deposition was found to produce alloys with compositions as large as approximately 0.38. Composition was found to increase with ablation energy density. In Appendix A, actual and simulated growth morphologies for Si growth by molecular beam deposition and pulsed laser deposition are compared. In Appendix B, the simulation code is listed.",1998
Recent Progress on Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Materials Based on Tetrazole Skeleton,"Development of nitrogen-rich energetic materials has gained much attention because of their remarkable properties including large nitrogen content and energy density, good thermal stability, low sensitivity, good energetic performance, environmental friendliness and so on. Tetrazole has the highest nitrogen and highest energy contents among the stable azoles. The incorporation of diverse explosophoric groups or substituents into the tetrazole skeleton is beneficial to obtain high-nitrogen energetic materials having excellent energetic performance and suitable sensitivity. In this review, the development of high-nitrogen energetic materials based on tetrazole skeleton is highlighted. Initially, the property and utilization of nitrogen-rich energetic materials are presented. After showing the advantage of the tetrazole skeleton, the high-nitrogen energetic materials based on tetrazole are classified and introduced in detail. Based on different types of energetic materials (EMs), the synthesis and properties of nitrogen-rich energetic materials based on mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-tetrazole are summarized in detail.

Unified Approach for Meso-Informed Burn Models in Shocked Energetic Materials,"Reactive hydrocode calculations of shock-to-detonation transition in heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials need to be closed with burn models. One requirement of burn models is to supply a macroscale control volume with an energy release rate due to chemical reactions that reflects the subgrid physics of hotspot ignition and growth. Energy localization at hotspots delivers chemical energy at a rate (e)over dot(meso) = Delta H-r/tau(meso), where Delta H-r is the heat of reaction and tmeso is a meso-scale energy localization time scale. This energy deposition rate is much larger than nominal Arrhenius-form chemical energy deposition rates in a homogeneous sample subjected to the same shock loading. To develop meso-informed energy deposition rate models, this paper identifies a meso-scale energy release time scale tau(meso) that is common to burn models based on the hotspot ignition and growth concept. The identification of a common time scale allows for a unified microstructure-aware, physics-based reactive burn model; high-fidelity meso-scale numerical simulations are used to construct a surrogate model for tau(meso). The surrogate model is shown to capture the effects of microstructural parameters on (e)over dot(meso) and can be used for meso-macro coupling in a multiscale model to predict the sensitivity of HE materials.",2020
Atomistic Studies of Shock-Wave and Detonation Phenomena in Energetic Materials,"The major goal of this PhD project is to investigate the fundamental properties of energetic materials, including their atomic and electronic structures, as well as mechanical properties, and relate these to the fundamental mechanisms of shock wave and detonation propagation using state-of-the-art simulation methods. The first part of this PhD project was aimed at the investigation of static properties of energetic materials (EMs) with specific focus on 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB). The major goal was to calculate the isotropic and anisotropic equations of state for TATB within a range of compressions not accessible to experiment, and to make predictions of anisotropic sensitivity along various crystallographic directions. The second part of this PhD project was devoted to applications of a novel atomic-scale simulation method, referred to as the moving window molecular dynamics (MW-MD) technique, to study the fundamental mechanisms of condensed-phase detonation. Because shock wave is a leading part of the detonation wave, MW-MD was applied to demonstrate its effectiveness in resolving fast non-equilibrium processes taking place behind the shock-wave front during shock-induced solid-liquid phase transitions in crystalline aluminum. Next, MW-MD was used to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of detonation propagation in condensed energetic materials. Due to the chemical complexity of real EMs, a simplified AB model of a prototypical energetic material was used. The AB interatomic potential, which describes chemical bonds, as well as chemical reactions between atoms A and B in an AB solid, was modified to investigate the mechanism of the detonation wave propagation with different reactive activation barriers. The speed of the shock or detonation wave, which is an input parameter of MW-MD, was determined by locating the Chapman-Jouguet point along the reactive Hugoniot, which was simulated using the constant number of particles, volume, and temperature (NVT) ensemble in MD. Finally, the detonation wave structure was investigated as a function of activation barrier for the chemical reaction AB + B → A + BB . Different regimes of detonation propagation including 1-D laminar, 2-D cellular, and 3-D spinning and turbulent detonation regimes were identified.",2011
MESO-STRUCTURAL INFLUENCES ON ENERGETIC MATERIAL RESPONSE TO THERMAL MECHANICAL LOADING,"The engineering design of high energy density material [HEDM] is often application specific. In order to analyze the functional relationship between design and application we have adopted the position that the design is defined by the suite of specifications and processes used to fabricate the component. [1] An analysis of this statement leads us to the conclusion that depending on the proposed function there exist a myriad of physical realization of the configuration at the subcomponent level in the design where there exist significant gaps in the specifications. This leads us to an investigation the family of physical configurations allowed by the design specification and our physically based understanding of the functional requirements. A required functional capabilities list contains a balance between performance, safety, and cost. The last several decades have seen an increased emphasis on the safety requirements addressed under the heading of Insensitive High Explosive [IHE] and Insensitive Munitions [IM]. Performance requirements have at the same time become more complicated for the energetic material designs based on the emergence of precision objectives associated with modern applications. Emerging classes of materials, called 'multi-functional' explosives, significantly complicate the relationship between design and function. [2]",2009
Thermal Properties of Energetic Materials-What Are the Sources of Discrepancies?,"Thermal analysis is widely used to investigate the properties of a variety of energetic materials, including the mutual compatibility of components of energetic material mixtures. Although thermal analysis methods are a valuable source of information about energetic materials, their use requires careful consideration of the employed methodology, as well as an understanding of the thermally induced processes taking place within energetic materials. Several case studies involving the study of energetic materials are presented, in order to highlight some of the most relevant issues in the application of thermal analysis methods. Some recommendations about the application of thermal analysis methods and accompanying methodologies for estimating other properties of energetic materials are also included.",2022
Detection of energetic materials via polyaniline and its different modified forms,"The detection techniques for traces of energetic materials (EMs) is achieved using fact interaction between fluorescent polymers and EMs. Researchers have designed various fluorophores for explosives detection worldwide. In present study, PAni, DBSA doped PAni (D-PAni), gamma-Fe(2)O(3)PAni composite (Fe-PAni), were synthesized and collectively used terminology as modified PAnis. This were employed for trace detection of EMs like TNT, RDX, PETN, and HNIW/CL-20 and compared outcome with our earlier results of doped PAnis. All the synthesized PAnis were characterized by FT-IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and resonance Raman studies, UV-Visible, and photoluminescence (PL). The PL studies showed that quenching is selective and sensitive at ppm level (LOD about 0.04-1.50 mu mL(-1)) and Fe-PAni emerged as a potential sensor (LOD; 0.092 +/- 0.07 mu mL(-1)). The formation of polaron from bipolaron, the existence of exciton and intermolecular interactions were confirmed and evaluated from the spectrochemical studies.",2021
Thermal analysis of an iodine rich binder for energetic material applications,"Biological agent defeat formulations containing an iodinated binder offer a unique solution for sterilization and neutralization of the surrounding environment in the form of iodine gas generation. This study characterized the thermal reactivity of an iodinated binder: hexamethylene diamine (HMD) trimer (C20H30N4O2I4) when combined with aluminum and iron oxide (Al + Fe2O3) thermite. Laser ignition studies were performed to evaluate ignition time and energy, as well as in-situ monitoring of the reaction using a high-speed camera. Thermal analysis of HMD showed four stages of exothermic decomposition plus generation of gas phase iodine species released upon decomposition. Thermal analysis of HMD + Al + Fe2O3 is consistent with laser ignition studies that showed HMD aids ignition and reaction of the ternary mixture. Overall, HMD contributed to heating and ignition as well as provided a source for iodine gas in multiple stages of the thermal reaction.",2020
Insensitive ionic bio-energetic materials derived from amino acids,"Energetic salts/ionic liquids have received increasing attention as fascinating energetic materials, and the use of renewable compounds is a promising approach to developing energetic materials. Until recently, biomolecules have been used as raw materials to develop neutral energetic compounds, whereas research focused on ionic energetic materials obtained from natural bio-renewable frameworks is scarce. This work systematically investigates ionic bio-energetic materials (IBEMs) derived from sustainable natural amino acids. In addition to combustibility, high density, good thermal stability, and one-step preparation, these IBEMs demonstrated apparent hypotoxicity and insensitivity. Moreover, a theoretical examination was performed to explore their appropriate properties. The intriguing results of this study indicates that IBEMs are potential bio-based energetic materials.",2017
The Insensitive Energetic Material Trifurazano-oxacycloheptatriene (TFO): Synthesis and Detonation Properties,The high-energy insensitive compound trifurazano-oxacycloheptatriene (TFO) was first by synthesized through special etherification. The reaction mechanism and reaction conditions were discussed. TFO has a low melting point (78.6 degrees C) and good compatibility. TFO is insensitive to impact and friction and has similar detonation velocity (7.7kms(-1)) and detonation pressure (35.6GPa) to RDX.,2015
Promising Oxygen- and Nitrogen-Rich Azidonitramino Ether Plasticizers for Energetic Materials,"A simple, mild and general method has been developed for the preparation of alkyl nitramines bearing a halogenoalkoxylic moiety. From these reactive halogen intermediates, a few azidoalkoxyl alkyl nitramines have been produced as energetic plasticizers. This simple protocol allows azidonitramino ether plasticizers to be obtained from available precursors in high yields, as it is safe and viable for large-scale operations. The resulting products have been fully characterized by spectral methods, and their impact sensitivity, thermal transformations and burning properties were determined, thus allowing complete comparison to the analogues including other combinations of structural units. Such characterization of these new plasticizers illustrates the extent to which the nature and position of the functional units can be used to tune the above properties of these nitramines. All azidonitramino ethers are liquid with excellent energetic performance and are promising candidates for new environmentally friendly energetic materials.",2022
Temperature and energetic disorder dependence of Seebeck coefficient in organic materials,"In clean energy sources, thermoelectric (TE) properties of organic materials have attracted much attention for their potential applications. In present work, using master equation method and considering the influence of temperatures on hopping rates as well as on-site energies, we investigated the characteristics of charge carrier TE transport in the organic material. In our model, the Seebeck coefficient of the organic material under different temperatures, reorganization energies and energetic disorders have been analyzed. Especially, the Seebeck coefficient exhibited different performances as the reorganization energy changes. The results will be helpful to understand TE properties of the organic material and make use of heat energies.",2022
Relationship between the crystal packing and impact sensitivity of energetic materials,"The crystal packing structure-safety (usually represented by sensitivity) relationships of energetic materials EMs) are requisite to set a basis for tailoring new ones with the desired safety by means of crystal engineering, because safety is one of the two most important properties of EMs for which there is always a high concern. Nevertheless, there is still no such relationship. This work proposes a straightforward and qualitative relationship between the packing structures and impact sensitivity of EMs, covering conventional EMs, energetic co-crystals, energetic solvates, and energetic ionic salts. Meanwhile, we propose a straightforward method to quickly identify the packing mode by the shape of the Hirshfeld surface and the distribution of the red dots on the surface of the molecule involved in an energetic crystal. As a result, we find that an EM with a packing structure of ready shear sliding tends to possess a low impact sensitivity, in combination with a high molecular stability. That is, a perfect face-to-face pi-stacking, constructed by big pi-bonded molecules together with strong intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, is preferred to impact insensitive EMs; moreover, if the intermolecular interactions and their anisotropy in an energetic crystal are enhanced, its impact sensitivity is expected to be improved too. Hopefully, the proposed relationship will facilitate understanding of the sensitivity mechanism of existing EMs, and will contribute to set a basis for guiding new EM constructions by molecular and crystal designs.",2018
1-Amino-3-nitroguanidine (ANQ) in High-performance Ionic Energetic Materials,"1-Amino-3-nitroguanidine (ANQ, 2) was synthesized via hydrazinolysis of nitroguanidine (1). An appropriate Lewis structure of ANQ is drawn based on VB calculations. Due to its basicity, it can be protonated by strong mineral acids or acidic heterocycles. In order to synthesize new energetic materials the nitrate (3) and perchlorate (4) salts of 1-amino-3-nitroguanidine were synthesized by protonation of 2 with 40% nitric acid and 60% perchloric acid, respectively. 5-Nitrimino-1,4H-tetrazole obtained by reacting 5-amino-1H-tetrazole with 100% HNO3 was used to synthesize the nitriminotetrazolate salt 5. Furthermore, the dinitramide salt 6 of 1-amino-3-nitroguanidine was synthesized by metathesis reaction of silver dinitramide and 1-amino-3-nitroguanidinium chloride. The dinitroguanidinate salt 7 was synthesized by protonation of 2 with 1,3-dinitroguanidine, which was prepared from nitroguanidine in anhydrous nitric acid/N2O5. All compounds were fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and DSC measurements. The heats of formation of 2-7 were calculated using the atomization method based on CBS-4M enthalpies. With these values and the experimental (X-ray) densities several detonation parameters such as the detonation pressure, velocity, energy, and temperature were computed using the EXPLO5 code. In addition, the sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrical discharge were tested using the BAM drophammer, friction tester as well as a small-scale electrical discharge device. A Koenen test with 1-amino-3-nitroguanidinium nitrate (3) was carried out in order to evaluate its explosive performance and shipping classification.",2012
Nitramino-functionalized tetracyclic oxadiazoles as energetic materials with high performance and high stability: crystal structures and energetic properties,"A series of tetracyclic energetic materials were developed through the introduction of 1,2,4-oxadiazole into nitramino-1,2,5-oxadiazole. All these thirteen new compounds were fully characterized and seven of them were further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Salt formation led to planarization of the parent structure, reduction in lengths, increase in bond-dissociation energies of N-NO2 bonds, and formation of hydrogen bonds, which significantly increased decomposition temperatures from 84 degrees C (the neutral compound) to 187-303 degrees C (the energetic salts). Thus, the increase in thermal stability falls in the range of 103-219 degrees C. To the best of our knowledge, 219 degrees C is the largest reported increase in thermal stability due to salt formation. In addition, electrostatic surface potentials and noncovalent interactions (p-p stacking) were analyzed to understand structure-property relationships of these compounds. Both theoretical calculations and practical explosive experiments indicate that the dihydroxylammonium salt exhibits better detonation performance than the powerful explosive RDX. The tetracyclic backbone provides these compounds with enhanced stability. Short synthesis steps, low cost, good thermostability, excellent detonation performance, and acceptable mechanical sensitivity highlight the practical applications of these energetic compounds.",2018
Ultrafast one-step synthesis of N and Ti,"An energetic-material (NaN 3) deflagration method for preparing N- and Ti3+-codoped TiO2 nanosheets (NT-TiO2) was developed. In this method, N radicals filled the crystal lattice, and Na clusters captured partial O from TiO2. The deflagration process was fast and facile and can be completed within < 1 s after ignition. The obtained NT-TiO2 exhibited rough surfaces with nanopits and nanoholes. The doping concentration can be regulated by controlling the NaN3 addition. The NT-TiO2 samples showed significant enhancements in the visible-light absorption and photoelectric response. The simultaneously produced N radicals and Na clusters from NaN3 deflagration served as N sources and reduction agents, respectively. Additionally, the high deflagration temperature/pressure improved the reactivity of N radicals and Na clusters. Thus, the present NaN3 deflagration method was demonstrated as an ultrafast and effective approach to fabricate NT-TiO2 with a visible-light response. The proposed NaN3 deflagration method allows the ultrafast synthesis of new functional materials via the efficient deflagration of energetic materials.",2018
Morphology constraint of ß-HMX in polymeric carbon nitrides towards hybrid energetic materials,"The exploration of hybrid energetic materials is of great importance because of their enhanced performances and promising applications in aerospace exploration, military and civil technologies. Herein, a new type hybrid energetic material is prepared by the integration of energetic molecule HMX and polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs). Two PCNs-HMX were prepared from melem and melem hydrazine by in-situ self-assembly on HMX with glyoxal, the complexes were named as MGP-HMX and MHGP-HMX, respectively. The planar structure and conjugated p-system of 2D-PCNs benefit the reduced sensitivities and help to control the polymorphism of HMX. The hybrid complexes MGP-HMX and MHGP-HMX demonstrate remarkably high thermal stabilities. An interesting morphology constraint effect of ss-HMX is observed only for the hydrazone-linked MHGP, but not for the imine-linked MGP. The constraint effect blocks the solid-solid transition of HMX from high energetic ss-phase to low energetic d-phase. The key to constrain the solid-solid morphology transition in MHGP-HMX is furtherly investigated by visualization of the interaction in composite materials. The massive hydrogen bonds between NO2 groups of HMX and hydrazone moieties of MHGP and the squeezing of HMX in 2D layers account for the morphology constrain. The morphology constraint via PCNs provides a new strategy for the construction of new hybrid energetic materials with high thermostability and low sensitivity.",2023
Multiscale multiphase modeling of detonations in condensed energetic materials (Reprinted from AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL COMPUTERS AND FLUIDS),"Hot spots ignition and shock to detonation transition modeling in pressed explosives is addressed in the frame of multiphase flow theory. Shock propagation results in mechanical disequilibrium effects between the condensed phase and the gas trapped in pores. Resulting subscale motion creates hot spots at pore scales. Pore collapse is modeled as a pressure relaxation process, during which dissipated power by the 'configuration' pressure produces local heating. Such an approach reduces 3D micromechanics and sub scale contacts effects to a 'granular' equation of state. Hot spots criticity then results of the competition between heat deposition and conductive losses. Heat losses between the hot solid-gas interface at pore's scale and the colder solid core grains are determined through a subgrid model using two energy equations for the solid phase. The conventional energy balance equation provides the volume average solid temperature and a non-conventional energy equation provides the solid core temperature that accounts for shock heating. With the help of these two temperatures and subscale reconstruction, the interface temperature is determined as well as interfacial heat loss. The overall flow model thus combines a full disequilibrium two-phase model for the mean solid-gas flow variables with a subgrid model, aimed to compute local solid-gas interface temperature. Its evolution results of both subscale motion dissipation and conductive heat loss. The interface temperature serves as ignition criterion for the solid material deflagration. There is no subscale mesh, no system of partial differential equations solved at grain scale. The resulting model contains less parameter than existing ones and associates physical meaning to each of them. It is validated against experiments in two very different regimes: Shock to detonation transition, that typically happens in pressure ranges of 50 kbar and shock propagation that involves pressure ranges 10 times higher.

Mathematical and Experimental Study for Mixed Energetic Materials Combustion in Closed System,"Modelling the energy release performance of energetic material combustion in closed systems is offundamental importance for aerospace and defense application. In particular, to compensate for the disadvantage of thecombustion of single energetic material and maximize the benefits, a method of combusting the mixed energetic materials isused. However, since complicated heat transfer occurs when the energetic material is combusted, it is difficult totheoretically predict the combustion performance. Here, we suggest a theoretical model to estimate the energy releaseperformance of mixed energetic material based on the model for the combustion performance of single energetic material. Toconfirm the effect of parameters on the model, and to gain insights into the combustion characteristics of the energeticmaterial, we studied parameter analysis on the reaction temperature and the characteristic time scales of energy generation andloss. To validate the model, model predictions for mixed energetic materials are compared to experimental resultsdepending on the amount and type of energetic material. The comparison showed little difference in maximum pressureand the reliability of the model was validated. Finally, we hope that the suggested model can predict the energy releaseperformance of single or mixed energetic material for various types of materials, as well as the energetic materials usedfor validation.",2022
Infrared Laser Diagnostics for Characterizing Combustion of Energetic Materials and Detonation Flows,"Laser-absorption spectroscopy (LAS) is an established technique providing noninvasive measurements of temperature, pressure, and species concentrations in combustion environments. Developments in both near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) laser technology have enabled measurements of numerous molecules to characterize combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and energetic materials. However, the harsh environments presented by advanced combustion systems can pose challenges for LAS diagnostics due to high pressures, density gradients, particulates in the environment, and low absorption signals. Furthermore, many thermochemical processes occurring in these environments evolve on µs timescales necessitating high speed measurements. ting high speed measurements. This work presents the development and application of several novel LAS diagnostics designed to address the challenges associated with performing measurements in harsh combustion environments. These diagnostics provided high speed measurements of temperature, pressure, H 2 O, CO, and optical density and were demonstrated in deflagrating fireballs of energetic materials, post-detonation fireballs, and a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE). A new wavelength-modulation spectroscopy technique (WMS) was developed to overcome the challenges associated with particulates in fireballs of energetic materials while achieving MHz measurement rates. While WMS is capable of overcoming particulate scattering and beamsteering and has been widely utilized in harsh environments, previous implementations were limited to measurement rates of ≤ 100 kHz. The two-color WMS technique developed here utilizes near-GHz modulation frequencies to provide enhanced noise rejection and achieve scanned-wavelength measurements at rates up to 1 MHz. This diagnostic utilized two tunable diode lasers (TDLs) near 1.4 µm modulated at 35 MHz and 45.5 MHz to simultaneously access two NIR H 2 O absorption transitions along a single line-of-sight (LOS). Measurements of temperature and H 2 O were obtained from the WMS-2f/1f signals measured at the linecenter of each transition. Several challenges associated with modulating TDLs at frequencies > 10 MHz were addressed and new laser characterization methods were developed. The diagnostic was validated in a high temperature gas cell and measured temperatures within 20 K of known values from 700 to 1200 K and H2O concentrations within 2 to 10% of known values. The near-GHz WMS diagnostic was applied to measure the path-integrated temperature and H2O column density in fireballs produced by igniting 0.75 g of grade 3, class B HMX with and without H-5 micro-aluminum powder (20% by mass). Temperature measurements were acquired in the fireballs with a 1-σ precision of 50 K, 30 K, and 15 K for measurement rates of 1 MHz, 250 kHz, and 25 kHz, respectively. The WMS diagnostic was extended by frequency multiplexing a third TDL to measure atomic iodine near 1.3 µm. The three TDLs were modulated at 35, 45.5, and 61.5 MHz. The three-color WMS diagnostic was applied to study fireballs with various initial formulations of HMX, micro-aluminum, and iodine crystals. The results indicated that the addition of H-5 micro-aluminum improves combustion performance and yields higher peak fireball temperatures, while the addition of I2 crystals significantly hinders fireball combustion. A MIR scanned-wavelength direct-absorption (scanned-DA) diagnostic was developed to overcome challenges associated with the short measurement path and high pressures in the annulus of a RDRE. A quantum cascade laser (QCL) was used to probe strong MIR CO absorption transitions thereby facilitating measurements across the short path length (1 cm) in the RDRE annulus. Scanned-DA was utilized to maximize the wavelength scan amplitude enabling measurements of multiple absorption transitions exhibiting significant collisional broadening due to the engine’s high operating pressure. The gas temperature, pressure, and CO partial pressure were inferred from the best-fit absorbance spectra which were simulated with a model utilizing the HITEMP2010 linestrengths and lower-state energies, E”, and a custom collisional-broadening model. The MIR scanned-DA diagnostic and the two-color NIR WMS diagnostic were applied to perform high-bandwidth measurements of (1) temperature, pressure, and CO, and (2) temperature and H2O, respectively, in the annular combustion chamber of an RDRE. The NIR diagnostic technique was extended to utilize measurements of WMS-4f/2f and WMS2f/1f signals. WMS-4f/2f measurements were used to infer the collisional-broadening full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the H2O transitions, and the WMS-2f/1f signals were then used to infer the gas temperature. The diagnostics were packaged in single-ended sensor assemblies to enable measurements in the annulus of a methane-oxygen RDRE, and results are presented for a test case with the RDRE operating at an equivalence ratio of 1.15 and a total propellant mass flow rate of 0.6 lb/s.",2021
An MD-SPH Coupled Method for the Simulation of Reactive Energetic Materials,"Reactive energetic materials have long been the interest of researchers due to their significant applications in the military industry. Much research has been done on the subject at macroscopic scale in the past decades and research at microscopic scale has been initiated recently with the invention of molecular-scale simulation tool LAMMP with ReaxFF. The equation of state (EoS) is the relation between physical quantities (pressure, temperature, energy and volume) describing thermodynamic states of materials under a given set of conditions. It plays a significant role in determining the characteristics of energetic materials, such as Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) point and detonation velocity. Furthermore, EoS is the key to connect microscopic and macroscopic phenomenon when simulating the macroscopic effects of an explosion. For instance, ignition and growth model for high explosives uses two Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) EoSs, one for solid explosive and the other for gaseous products. It would be much less expensive and hazardous to obtain the EoSs of energetic materials through computational method instead of field experiment. In this thesis, the EoSs of solid and gaseous products of ß-HMX are calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with ReaxFF-d3, which is a reactive force field calculated from quantum mechanics. The microscopic simulation results are compared with experiments, first-principles calculations, and then applied in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the macroscopic simulation of high explosives. SPH is a meshless Lagrangian method which was first invented to study astrophysics problems. SPH is advantageous in tracking free interfaces and dealing with large deformation, therefore it has been extended to fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Ignition and growth model, as the most popular numerical model for high explosives, has been integrated in commercial software such as ANSYS LS-DYNA. In the thesis, ignition and growth model is integrated in our in-house SPH codes to simulate the detonation of high explosives. Aluminized explosive is an enhanced metalized explosive, which usually contains high explosive such as HMX, and uses aluminum particles (5~10 µm in diameter) as additive. The combustion of aluminum particles is complicated chemical process that involves reactions between aluminum and air, aluminum and gaseous products of explosive. During the combustion it generates large amount of heat to enhance long-last burning effect. Though aluminized explosive has been applied in military industry for decades, the mechanism underneath the process is still not thoroughly understood. The numerical modeling of aluminized explosive poses great challenge to simulation community till today. In the thesis, an afterburning model is used to simulate the combustion of aluminum particles in aluminized explosive. In recent years, more advanced and innovative SPH methods are proposed and studied extensively, such as Godunov SPH, which integrates Riemann solver and eliminates the need for artificial viscosity in traditional SPH. In the thesis, a Godunov SPH method is described and validated using benchmark problem and other numerical examples. Afterwards, the Godunov SPH method is applied for the the simulation of high explosive. Lastly, a three-dimensional SPH model with JWL++ model is developed for non-ideal explosive Ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO). The influence of smoothing length on simulation is investigated. A three-dimensional cylinder test model is developed for ANFO to test the stability and accuracy of the proposed SPH method with JWL++ model.",2017
The Application of Differential Scanning Calorimetry to Thermal Analysis for Energetic Materials,Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a common and useful method for thermal analysis.

Thermal Bimorph Micro-Cantilever Based Nano-Calorimeter for Sensing of Energetic Materials,"The objective of this study is to develop a robust portable nano-calorimeter sensor for detection of energetic materials, primarily explosives, combustible materials and propellants. A micro-cantilever sensor array is actuated thermally using bi-morph structure consisting of gold ( Au: 400 nm ) and silicon nitride ( Si 3 N 4 : 600 nm ) thin film layers of sub-micron thickness. An array of micro-heaters is integrated with the microcantilevers at their base. On electrically activating the micro-heaters at different actuation currents the microcantilevers undergo thermo-mechanical deformation, due to differential coefficient of thermal expansion. This deformation is tracked by monitoring the reflected ray from a laser illuminating the individual microcantilevers (i.e., using the optical lever principle). In the presence of explosive vapors, the change in bending response of microcantilever is affected by the induced thermal stresses arising from temperature changes due to adsorption and combustion reactions (catalyzed by the gold surface). A parametric study was performed for investigating the optimum values by varying the thickness and length in parallel with the heater power since the sensor sensitivity is enhanced by the optimum geometry as well as operating conditions for the sensor (e.g., temperature distribution within the microcantilever, power supply, concentration of the analyte, etc.). Also, for the geometry present in this study the nano-coatings of high thermal conductivity materials (e.g., Carbon Nanotubes: CNTs) over the microcantilever surface enables maximizing the thermally induced stress, which results in the enhancement of sensor sensitivity. For this purpose, CNTs are synthesized by post-growth method over the metal (e.g., Palladium Chloride: PdCl 2 ) catalyst arrays pre-deposited by Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) technique. The threshold current for differential actuation of the microcantilevers is correlated with the catalytic activity of a particular explosive (combustible vapor) over the metal ( Au ) catalysts and the corresponding vapor pressure. Numerical modeling is also explored to study the variation of temperature, species concentration and deflection of individual microcantilevers as a function of actuation current. Joule-heating in the resistive heating elements was coupled with the gaseous combustion at the heated surface to obtain the temperature profile and therefore the deflection of a microcantilever by calculating the thermally induced stress and strain relationship. The sensitivity of the threshold current of the sensor that is used for the specific detection and identification of individual explosives samples - is predicted to depend on the chemical kinetics and the vapor pressure. The simulation results showed similar trends with the experimental results for monitoring the bending response of the microcantilever sensors to explosive vapors (e.g., Acetone and 2-Propanol) as a function of the actuation current.",2012
Analysis of shock propagation and shock-initiated reaction in granular energetic materials,"Propagation of weak shock waves ($\sim$ 1 $-$ 10 GPa) through granular, energetic materials can, in some instances, result in localized heating and initiation of reaction. The study presented here is directed at developing a model that is capable of predicting shock induced reaction in granular materials. The governing equations for reactive, solid/gas flow are formulated, and an appropriate solution technique is used to integrate the system of equations. In order to model the shock initiation process for these aggregate, reactive materials, a reliable simulation of shock propagation prior to initiation is essential. In preliminary results presented here, a finite-difference numerical scheme for two-phase flow (solid, gas) is used to model the behavior of weakly shocked granular material. The two-phase conservation equations are solved in addition to the equations of state for the solid and gas phases. The solid phase compressibility is modeled by a Mie-Gruneisen state equation. Quasi-static compaction data for the solid/gas mixture are used to couple the compressibility of the individual grains with the bulk compaction behavior of the granular bed. Predicted values for unreacted shock velocity, density and pressure are compared with experimental results for the three classes of a high-energy crystalline substance. The comparisons include a variety of shock impact conditions ranging from 20 to 100 MPa. The capabilities of the model are then expanded to include: dynamic pore collapse at grain boundaries, hot spot initiation and release of chemical energy, and more exact constitutive relations for interphase transport of mass, momentum, and energy. A key feature of the work is coupling the bulk compressive shock energy with the resulting thermal energy of the localized hot spots (initiation sites). To model hot spot formation, a viscoplastic pore collapse model is introduced. Limited experimental data for shock velocity and particle velocity are available to verify various aspects of the model.",1990
Manganese molybdate nanoflakes on silicon microchannel plates as novel nano energetic material,"Nano energetic materials have attracted great attention recently owing to their potential applications for both civilian and military purposes. By introducing silicon microchannel plates (Si-MCPs) three-dimensional (3D)-ordered structures, monocrystalline MnMoO4 with a size of tens of micrometres and polycrystalline MnMoO4 nanoflakes are produced on the surface and sidewall of nickel-coated Si-MCP, respectively. The MnMoO4 crystals ripen controllably forming polycrystalline nanoflakes with lattice fringes of 0.542 nm corresponding to the ((1) over bar 11) plane on the sidewall. And these MnMoO4 nanoflakes show apparent thermite performance which is rarely reported and represents MnMoO4 becoming a new category of energetic materials after nanocrystallization. Additionally, the nanocrystallization mechanism is interpreted by ionic diffusion caused by 3D structure. The results indicate that the Si-MCP is a promising substrate for nanocrystallization of energetic materials such as MnMoO4.",2017
Synthesis and characterization of multicyclic oxadiazoles and 1-hydroxytetrazoles as energetic materials,"Synthesis and characterization of several multicyclic oxadiazoles, 3,5-bis(4-nitrofurazan-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole, 3,3'-bis(4-nitrofurazan-3-yl)-5,5'-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole), 3-(4-nitrofurazan-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-amine, and salts of 1-hydroxytetrazoles, ammonium 5,5'-(1,2,4-oxadiazole-3,5-diyl)bis(1H-tetrazol-1-olate) and hydroxylammonium 5,5'-{[3,3'-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole)]-5,5'-diyl}bis(1H-tetrazol-1-olate), as energetic materials are reported. Two of the compounds, 3,5-bis(4-nitrofurazan-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole and 3,3'-bis(4-nitrofurazan-3-yl)-5,5'-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole), have attractive single crystal densities of 1.91 and 1.94 g center dot cm(-3) (at 20A degrees C), respectively. The design of these materials has been based on the idea that these multicyclic compounds with a 1,2,4-oxadiazole core will have good thermal stability and high density because of their 3,5-substitution pattern and the possibility of achieving a planar conformation. The various synthetic approaches and interesting chemistry observed during the construction of these new heterocycles has been described.",2017
Variations in Cathodoluminescent Intensity of Spacecraft Materials Exposed to Energetic Electron Bombardment,"Many contemporary spacecraft materials exhibit cathodoluminescence when exposed to electron flux from the space plasma environment. A quantitative physics-based model has been developed to predict the intensity of the total glow as a function of incident electron current density and energy, temperature, and intrinsic material properties. We present a comparative study of the absolute spectral radiance for more than 20 types of dielectric and composite materials based on this model, which spans more than three orders of magnitude. Variations in intensity are contrasted for different electron environments, different sizes of samples and sample sets, different testing and analysis methods, and data acquired at different test facilities. Together, these results allow us to estimate the accuracy and precision to which laboratory studies may be able to determine the response of spacecraft materials in the actual space environment. It also provides guidance as to the distribution of emissions that may be expected for sets of similar flight hardware under similar environmental conditions.",2015
Molecular dynamics simulations of interactions between energetic dust and plasma-facing materials,"The interactions between dust and plasma-facing material (PFM) relate to the lifetime of PFM and impurity production. Series results have been obtained theoretically and experimentally but more detailed studies are needed. In present research, we investigate the evolution of kinetic, potential and total energy of plasma-facing material (PFM) in order to understand the dust/PFM interaction process. Three typical impacting energy are selected, i.e., 1, 10 and 100 keV/dust for low-, high- and hyper-energy impacting cases. For low impacting energy, dust particles stick on PFM surface without damaging it. Two typical time points exist and the temperature of PFM grows all the time but PFM structure experience a modifying process. Under high energy case, three typical points appear. The temperature curve fluctuates in the whole interaction process which indicates there are dust/PFM and kinetic/potential energy exchanges. In the hyper-energy case in present simulation, the violence dust/PFM interactions cause sputtering and crater investigating on energy evolution curves. We further propose the statistics of energy distribution. Results show that about half of impacting energy consumes on heating plasma-facing material meanwhile the other half on PFM structure deformation. Only a small proportion becomes kinetic energy of interstitial or sputtering atoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
Thermal decomposition mechanism of particulate core-shell KClO,"The thermal decomposition mechanism of a newly designed composite material KClO3-HMX (KC-HMX) is investigated by combined TG-DSC-FTIR technique and T/Jump in-situ thermolysis cell/FTIR (T/Jump FTIR) technique. It is shown that KC-HMX began to decompose at about 266 degrees C without melting, and the fast stage of mass loss at the temperature range of 268.4 similar to 290.1 degrees C is considered to be the result of the thermolysis and complex reactions of KClO3 and HMX with energy release of 1859 J.g(-1), which exceeded that of pure HMX about 40%. It is also shown that CO, CO2, NO2 and H2O were the main gaseous products. The Thump FTIR analysis showed that the competing reactions of N-N and C-N bonds cleavage occurred in initial stage of HMX decomposition are greatly affected by KClO3. In contrast of pure HMX, there is no CH2O and HCN detected in its thermolysis products. In presence of electronegative oxygen radical produced by thermolysis of KClO3 oxidized CH2O and HCN through gas-phase reaction ""(NO2+4O(2)) + (2N(2)O+5CH(2)O) -> 5NO+3CO+2CO(2)+5H(2)O"", which is probably the dominating reaction, being immediately followed by the decomposition reaction of HMX.",2011
"Magnesium Azotetrazole-1,1-dioxide: Synthesis and Promising Properties of Green Insensitive Energetic Materials","Magnesium azotetrazole-1,1-dioxide (1) was first prepared and intensively characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and DSC measurements. The heat of formation was calculated using the atomization energy method based on quantum chemistry and the heat of detonation was also predicted. The NBO analysis was performed for inspecting charge distributions. The sensitivities towards impact and friction were tested using the BAM standard. The high detonation performance (5289 kJ center dot kg(-1)), good thermal stabilities (245.5 degrees C) and excellent insensitivity (39.2 J and >360 N) as well as clean decomposition products supports it of great interest as a promising candidate of green insensitive energetic materials.",2017
Design and Synthesis of Energetic Melt-Castable Materials by Substituent-Specific Modification,"With the increase in the demand for high-performance composite explosives, the search for advanced energetic melt-castable compounds has attracted increasing attention in the field of energetic materials. Herein, two new energetic materials with nitromethyl and azidomethyl substituents (1-(nitromethyl)-3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazole (NMDNP) and 1-(azidomethyl)-3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazole (AMDNP) were prepared by the substituent modification of a potential melt-castable molecule ((3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) methyl nitrate, MC-4), respectively. NMDNP exhibited a suitable melting point (90 & DEG;C), good thermal stability (Td: 185 & DEG;C) and excellent detonation performance (8484 m s-1) and impact sensitivity (25 J), thereby demonstrating promise as an energetic melt-castable material. Simultaneously, compared with the nitrato-methyl and azidomethyl substituents, the nitromethyl substituent exhibited greater advantages in regulating performance. The new energetic molecule, 1-(nitromethyl)-3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazole (NMDNP), exhibits balanced properties including suitable melting point, good thermal stability, excellent detonation performance and impact sensitivity as a high-performance energetic melt-castable material.image",2023
Crystal packing driven comparable thermal expansion of a biimidazole-based energetic material,"The thermal expansion is one of the important reasons for the stress increase in polymer bonded explosive (PBX) and the damage of the long-term storage structure of explosives. Herein, the thermal expansion characteristics and crystal damage behavior under thermal stimulation of three crystal forms (beta, alpha and gamma) of 4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-1H,1'H- [2,2'-biimidazole]-1,1'-diamine (DATNBI) were analyzed. The results show that DATNBI has obvious anisotropic thermal expansion, in which beta- and alpha-DATNBI are first-order thermal expansion, and gamma-DATNBI is second-order thermal expansion. The thermal expansion of DATNBI is reversible, but the crystal damage caused by thermal expansion is irreversible. Combined with Rietveld Refinement of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, the volumetric expansion coefficients are 17.98x10(-5) degrees C-1 (beta-DATNBI), 23.28x10(-5) degrees C-1 (alpha-DATNBI) and 14.39x10(-5) degrees C-1 (gamma-DATNBI), respectively. The relationship between crystal packing and thermal expansion characteristics of DATNBI at different temperatures was studied. It is demonstrated that the thermal expansion can probe certain intermolecular interactions resulting in anisotropic expansion behavior. Usually, the thermal expansion of most crystals (beta-DATNBI) is positive, but slip or dislocation may cause a smaller negative expansion of a certain axis of the crystal cell (alpha-DATNBI). However, the unique cross-cross grid crystal packing (gamma-DATNBI) will make a certain axis of the cell appear obvious negative expansion, which may lead to the overall decrease in the volumetric expansion coefficient of the crystal.",2023
Rheological Considerations for Binder Development in Direct Ink Writing of Energetic Materials,"Additive manufacturing is a promising approach to prepare highly specifically defined materials with unique dimensions, gradients in material attributes and on-demand properties. For energetic materials applications, it is particularly exciting for its potential to create lattice and cellular structures and gradient solids to focus or dissipate energy. However, there are significant challenges to overcome, particularly in obtaining the very high particle content (>80 vol % particles), while still being manufacturable. This work focuses on the polymer binder used in an energetic materials system and aims to understand how its characteristics affect the viscosity and printability of the suspension. Two different types of polymer binders are examined: (a) high molecular weight polymer in a solvent and (b) polymerizable smaller molecules that were cured via UV light. We show that the suspension viscosity is primarily controlled by the particle volume fraction for the UV curable binder, while both the particle volume fraction and polymer molecular weight influence the response in the case of the polymer/solvent binder. Both binder types can be tuned to provide printable suspensions that result in lines of consistent width and 3D disc-shaped objects, indicating that both paths are good potential directions for future formulations for polymer bonded explosives prepared via additive manufacturing.",2020
N-functionalized nitroxy/azido fused-ring azoles as high-performance energetic materials,"A series of fused ring-based nitrate esters/azides and a coupled-ring-based nitrate ester were prepared using a simple and efficient nitrogen-functionalization approach. All new energetic compounds were fully characterized. Structures of four (1-4) were further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. These nitrate esters have good thermal stabilities and high densities. Energetic performance was evaluated by using EXPLO5 v6.01 based on measured densities and calculated heats of formation (Gaussian 03 (Revision D. 01)). The results show that some of the representative fused ring-based nitrate esters exhibit good detonation properties, for example, 1 (vD, 8674 m s(-1); P, 33.1 Gpa) and 2 (vD, 8669 m s(-1); P, 33.4 Gpa), that approach those of current high explosive benchmarks, such as 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Sensitivity data based on impact and friction tests show these compounds have better stabilities than the traditional nitrate ester explosive, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN).",2016
Diffusion flames in condensed-phase energetic materials: Application to Titanium-Boron combustion,"The characteristics of a steady diffusion flame that arises at the interfaces of two condensed phase reactant streams that form an opposed counterflow are discussed. We assume that the flow is due to deformation from compaction or local heating and thermal expansion processes in the microscale environment of composite energetic materials. As a representative example of high temperature combustion of metal/intermetallic reactants, the overall reaction of titanium and boron to create titanium diboride products is considered under near isobaric conditions. The multi-component diffusion description uses a generalized Fick formulation with coefficients related to the binary diffusivities defined in the Maxwell-Stefan relations. A fairly simple depletion form with Arrhenius temperature dependent coefficients is used to describe the reaction rate. Several types of analyses are carried out at increasing levels of complexities: an asymptotic analysis valid in the limit of low strain rates (high residence time in the reaction zone), a constant mixture density assumption that simplifies the flow description, diffusion models with equal and unequal molecular weights for the various species, and a full numerical study for finite rate chemistry, composition-dependent density and strain rates extending from low to moderate values. All are found to agree remarkably well in describing the flame structure, the flame temperature and the degree of incomplete combustion. Of particular importance is the determination of a critical strain rate beyond which steady burning may no longer be observed. The analysis has a general character and can be applied to other condensed phase energetic material systems, where reaction and diffusion occur in the presence of flow and material deformation.

"THE HIGH PRESSURE CHARACTERIZATION OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS: DIHYDRAZINIUM 5, 5′- AZOTETRAZOLATE DIHYDRATE","The isothermal structural properties, equation of state, and vibrational dynamics of Dihydrazinium 5,5'- azotetrazolate dihydrate (HAT) were studied under high-pressure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and optical Infrared microspectroscopy. X-ray diffraction characterization revealed the existence of a phase transition near 10.3 GPa from the P2/c to the P2 space group. Several spectral modifications associated with this transition, such as mode splitting and intensity changes were observed in the Infrared spectroscopic measurements, giving insight into the molecular structure of the high-pressure phase.",2012
Elastic and phonon-mode anomalies with temperature in the energetic material C,"Temperature-dependent Brillouin and Raman spectroscopic investigations are carried out on energetic material 4, 10 -Dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetr aoxa-4, 10 -diazatetracyclo [5.5.0.0(5.9).0(3.11)] -dodecane (TEX; C6H6N4O8) from -196 to 180 degrees C, close to its sublimation point, to study its elastic and phonon mode behaviors. Ambient values of experimental shear (G) and bulk (K) moduli of TEX are obtained as G = 5.6 GPa and K = 17.7 GPa. We have computed the elastic tensor and obtained the averaged bulk and shear moduli to compare with the experimentally obtained polycrystalline values. The known lower sensitivity of TEX compared with similar caged secondary explosives as CL-20, Royal Demolition eXplosive, and beta-High Melting eXplosive is reckoned as due to its inherently high bulk modulus. We report direct experimental evidence of rapid reduction in elastic constant of TEX from 20 to 80 degrees C, much before its melting point. Though there are no phase transitions in this temperature span, all Raman bands exhibit softening behavior around this temperature. We observe two distinct anomalies. Some bending modes such as bending of CNC (356 cm(-1)), in-plane bending of NNO (552 cm(-1)), bending of NCO (610 cm(-1)), in-plane bending of NNO (635 cm(-1)), and in-plane bending of ONO and OCO (712 cm(-1)) exhibit slight hardening before and after the elastic anomaly. However, the asymmetric stretching modes at 1574 cm(-1) (asymmetric stretch of NO) and 1590 cm(-1) (asymmetric stretch of NO2) exhibit hardening below 20 degrees C but soften after 80 degrees C. This hardening switching over to softening above the anomaly indicates a release of stiffness manifesting from a conformational change to exo-endo and aiding the increasing compressibility. Emergence of new diffraction peaks -50 degrees C and even observed at 150 degrees C, which is well above the elastic anomaly, suggests that the material at high temperature may be isostructural to that at low temperature. In this paper, we establish that the high bulk modulus value of TEX contributes to its lower sensitivity; however, we also clearly demonstrate reduction in elastic modulus accompanied by anomalous behavior of Raman modes. This decrease in elastic modulus leading to increased compressibility may result in increased sensitivity of the explosive material just above room temperature.",2022
Review of the molecular and crystal correlations on sensitivities of energetic materials,"Highly efficient design on the levels of molecule and crystal, as well as formulation, is highly desired for accelerating the development of energetic materials (EMs). Sensitivity is one of the most important characteristics of EMs and should be compulsorily considered in the design. However, owing to multiple factors responsible for the sensitivity, it usually undergoes a low predictability. Thus, it becomes urgent to clarify which factors govern the sensitivity and what is the importance of these factors. The present article focuses upon the progress of the molecular and crystal correlations on the sensitivity, and the molecule-based numerical models for sensitivity prediction in the past decades. On the molecular level, composition, geometric structure, electronic structure, energy and reactivity can be correlated with the sensitivity; while the sensitivity can be also related with molecular packing pattern, intermolecular interaction, crystal morphology, crystal size and distribution, crystal surface/interface and crystal defect on the crystal level. And most of these factors, in particle on the crystal level, have been employed as variables in numerical models for predicting sensitivity of categorized EMs. Besides, we stress that more attention should be paid to the sensitivity correlations on the inherent structures of EMs, molecule and crystal packing, because they can be readily dealt by molecular simulations nowadays, facilitating to reveal the physical nature of sensitivity.",2020
Experiments and numerical simulations of plate gap model for high energetic materials,"Experimental and numerical study for detonation propagation was conducted using the system in which the high energy materials and air gaps alternately stacked. The aim of this simulation is an extraction of information of the EOS for detonation product at arbitrary initial density from the numerical simulation with EOS at TMD (theoretical maximum density). In this report, we described the numerical procedure and an example of the calculation result. On the other hand, the experiment was designed for confirmation of the validity of our reactive flow simulation. The experimental system for this study consists of the pellet explosives and PMMA rings, PMMA pipe and booster explosive part. The pellets and the rings were alternately stacked in the PMMA pipe to make the system. The diameter of the pellet was 20 mm and the thicknesses were 10 or 5 mm. The thickness of the ring was varied to adjust the size of the air gaps between the pellets. The sample explosive was a composition A5 (RDX 98.8 wt%). The relationship between the bulk density which was estimated by the thicknesses of the pellets and the air gaps and the average detonation velocity was compared with the data for RDX. The slopes of those relationships differed mutually. Although the experimental results can be used for confirmation of the validity of the numerical procedure, it does not simulate the detonation wave in the powdered explosive. It may show the interesting process that consists of the shock wave in air, shock to detonation transition and steady detonation.",2014
Development of an experimental device for low velocity impacts on energetic material,"Energetic materials are sensitive to ""low"" mechanical, chemical and thermal stresses, whose origin is probably linked to their microstructural damaging. The present study focuses on a composite propellant composed of ammonium perchlorate grains in a polyurethane binder (HTPB). To describe the thermo-mechanical behavior of this material, at the mesoscopic scale under low impact, drop weight tests are carried out under various experimental configurations, adding a high speed camera recorder and ante- and post-mortem X-ray micro tomographies. Several modifications of the usual device are developed in order to explore as many experimental configurations as possible. Results obtained during validation tests of the modified device enable us to consider that it can give the required data for the identification and characterization of the damage mechanisms that could be part of the hot spots initiation process and reaction ignition under low impact.",2009
Energetic materials in 3D: an in-depth exploration of additive manufacturing techniques,"Recently, because of the complex international situation and combat environment in the future, the development and application of new concept weapons have raised higher performance requirements for manufacturing technologies. However, at present, most weapons are still prepared using traditional charging methods (cast curing, pressure casting, and melt casting), which require subtractive manufacturing (SM) treatments before use. At present, the demand for weapon products is shifting towards reactive micro structures, high preparation efficiency, miniaturization, and controllable energy release. Besides, the modern ""energetic-on-a-chip"" trend was expected to reduce size and cost while increasing safety and maintaining performance. In this case, the traditional charging methods were not preferred due to their inherent drawbacks, such as being limited to the model, requiring long solvent drying times and recycling required and pores/cracks caused by the shrinkage of slurry, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to innovate the processing and manufacturing technology of weapons and address the boundaries of existing charging methods, and this will enable the precise customization of high-quality energetic materials and avoid many defects. Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing technology, has been booming recently. The application of additive manufacturing technology in the field of energetic materials (EMs) can promote the innovation of manufacturing technology for EMs and regulate the microstructure. Additionally, 3D printing technology can break through the existing design and development mode, expand explosive charging technology, and enable the distribution of different types of explosives and explosive density in a specific space area. Besides, 3D printing can fabricate ""reactive microstructures"" (RMS), which offer a deeper understanding of the EMs' combustion and detonation phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. Thus, the explosive/propellant grains with multiple damage modes can be designed and manufactured. This paper aims to summarize the current progress in the 3D printing of EMs, analyze the corresponding mechanisms, and provide guidance for future research.",
Conjugated Energetic Salts Based on Fused Rings: Insensitive and Highly Dense Materials,"Nitroamino-functionalized 1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-1)] [1,2,4,5]-tetrazine (1), when combined with intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) and strong noncovalent interactions between layers, results, for example, in an interlayer distance of 2.9 angstrom for dihydroxylammonium 3,6-dinitramino-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]-tetrazine (2c) with a packing coefficient of 0.805. For dihydroxylammonium 6,6'-dinitramino-3,3'-azo-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]-tetrazine (3b), two fused rings are linked by an azo group, which expands the conjugated system resulting in an even shorter interlayer distance of 2.7 angstrom and a higher packing coefficient of 0.807. These values appear to be the shortest interlayer distances and the highest packing coefficients reported for tetrazine energetic materials. With high packing coefficients, both possess high densities of 1.92 g cm(-3) and 1.99 g cm(-3) at 293 K, respectively. Compared with its precursor, the hydroxylammonium moiety serves as a buffer chain (H-N-O-H), connecting the anion and cation through hydrogen bonds, giving rise to more favorable stacking, and resulting in higher density and lower sensitivity. The sensitivities of all the hydroxylammonium salts are lower than that of their neutral precursors, such as compound 2 (3 J, > 5 N) and compound 2c (25 J, 360 N). The detonation properties of 2c (detonation velocity v(D) = 9712 m s(-1) and detonation pressure P = 43 GPa) and 3b (v(D) = 10233 m s(-1); P = 49 GPa) exceed those of present high explosive benchmarks, such as octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and hexanitrohexaazaisowurzitane (CL-20). The molecular structures of several of these new energetic materials are confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. Using calculated and experimental results, the fused ring with a planar large pi-conjugated system results in a compromise between desirable stabilities and high detonation properties, thus enhancing future utilization in the design of energetic materials.",2018
Investigation of energetic materials prepared by reactions of diamines with picryl chloride,"Five compounds containing picryl group(s) were synthesized from reactions of hydrazine, 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane and 1,7-diaminoheptane with picryl chloride under hydrothermal conditions in methanol. Hydrazine reaction yielded N-2,4,6-trinitrophenylhydrazine which has a single picryl group, whereas the other reactants formed symmetric products with both amine groups connected to picryl groups. These compounds are N,N'-di-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-1,2-diaminoethane, bis-N,N'-di-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-1,3-diaminopropane, bis-N,N'-di-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-1,4-diaminobutane and bis-N,N'-di-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-1,7-diaminoheptane. Molecular structures of two of these compounds, N-2,4,6-trinitrophenylhydrazine and bis-N,N'-di-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-1,3-diaminopropane, were revealed by XRD methods. All compounds were investigated by TG and DSC methods. The thermal behaviour of N-2,4,6-trinitrophenylhydrazine was explosive, undergoing a strong explosion in a very short temperature interval, 180-185 A degrees C. In cases of the other compounds, it was found out that the carbon chain between two picryl groups reduced the explosion enthalpy. In addition, the theoretical formation enthalpy of N-2,4,6-trinitrophenylhydrazine was calculated by running CBS-4 M energy calculations under Gaussian 09 software package. From the calculated value, reaction enthalpy values for the possible explosion pathways were investigated in accordance with the experiment. The path with reaction enthalpy closest to the experimental value was proposed as the explosion mechanism.",2017

Lighting and Energetic Characteristics of Transparent Insulating Materials: Experimental Data and Calculation,"This paper reports the study of thermal and optical properties of innovative transparent insulating materials (TIM) for glazing systems: silica aerogel (pane and granular) and capillary geometric media. Twenty-one samples were assembled with several kinds of glasses in various combinations with TIM. Transmission and reflection coefficients versus wavelength were measured and the results were elaborated in compliance with UNI EN 410/2000. The better performance was given by the monolithic aerogel both for light transmittance (0.58 in interspace between two 4 mm float glasses) and thermal insulation (U = 0.63 W . m(-2) . K-1). The solar factor was 0.70. The performance of the innovative glazing systems was compared with data related to windows normally used in Italy and in EU countries, in order to comply with the limits of the local normative standard required for thermal transmittance. The results showed a very promising behaviour of TIMs, in fact a 60% reduction in heat losses with respect to a double glazing with a low-e layer was achieved, with only a 27% reduction in light transmittance. For the granular systems, a U-value little higher than 1 W . m(-2) . K-1 with the same total thickness was obtained, even if the light reduction was about 66%.",2011
Putting the pressure on energetic materials; the structure of ζ CL-20,We have determined the structure of zeta CL-20 a high-pressure form of CL-20 that transforms from gamma CL-20 at 0.7 GPa. As this form is not recoverable to ambient pressures and temperatures we studied this form in situ in a diamond anvil cell with a combination of single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction techniques.,2010
Design of conductive polymer coating layer for effective desensitization of energetic materials,"Safety performance under external stimuli plays a crucial role for energetic materials. Therefore, desensitization of high explosive arouses widespread research interests in the field of energetic materials. Nevertheless, synergistically reducing impact and electrostatic spark sensitivities of 1,3,5,7-tetranittro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) remains challenging. Herein, a novel strategy concerning conductive polymer coating was proposed to solve this issue. Theoretically, the polypyrrole (PPy) can form a complete shell and strong interaction with HMX crystals. The HMX@PPy composite has been successfully achieved by in-situ polymerization, exhibiting superior sensitivities (impact: from 7 J to 27.5 J and electrostatic spark: from 0.4 J to 1.68 J) among reported HMX-based energetic materials. In addition, the thermal phase stability of HMX can also be visibly improved with sluggish phase-transition kinetics by introducing PPy coating. The current study provides a design concept for high energy explosives with low sensitivity and improved comprehensive performances.",2024
Effect of Volume Compression on Laser Pulse Initiation Thresholds of Energetic Materials,"Energy thresholds of laser pulse initiation and kinetic characteristics of explosive decomposition of heavy metal azides (HMA), including pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and furazanotetrazine dioxide (FTDO), have been studied at different pressures of uniform compression. Samples were excited by the first harmonic of the neodymium laser (& lambda; = 1064 nm) with the actuating pulse duration & tau; = 14 ns. It has been established that the sensitivity of energetic materials (EM) to the pulsed laser action increases monotonically with the pressure. Experimental results are interpreted within the framework of the hot microspot ignition theory based on the features of gas-dynamic unloading from the volume of hot spots.",2023
Atomistic insight into enhanced thermal decomposition of energetic material on graphene oxide,"Graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocomposites are promising additives for practical applications of cy-clotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX). GO is not only an excellent support for nanoparticles, but also has in-dependent catalytic activities, which have not been well understood. In this study, the reactive molecular dynamics simulation method is employed to investigate the kinetics and fundamental catalytic mechanisms of the thermal decomposition of RDX on GO. The RDX decomposition reaction is found to be enhanced in the presence of GO and the catalytic effect is better at low than at high temperatures. Additionally, GO ad-dition lowers the activation energy by 11.35% compared with the thermal decomposition of pure RDX. The study shows that the catalytic capabilities of GO primarily originate from its functional groups that promote both the initiation and intermediate reactions. Furthermore, the H exchange process between the functional groups on GO and RDX/RDX intermediates plays an important role in the reaction. GO is further oxidized with more functional groups during the reaction, which are also involved in the catalytic activities. Finally, the energy barrier of functional group-participated reactions is found to be lower than their corresponding unimolecular decomposition leading to enhanced thermal decomposition of RDX. The proposed catalytic mechanisms in the present research should also be applicable to other energetic materials of the same class with a similar structure as RDX.& COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

Toxicity Assessment of Energetic Materials by Using the Luminescent Bacteria Inhibition Test,"The luminescent bacteria inhibition test usingAliivibrio fischeriis a well-established method to determine the aquatic toxicity of soluble chemicals. More precisely, the effective concentration (EC50) after 15 and 30 min is determined in this test. The inhibition of natural bioluminescence of these bacteria gives a first idea of the toxicity of compounds towards some aquatic organisms. It is a cost and time efficient experimental method, which does not involve animals. In this contribution, the experimental set up, comparability with other measurements, and results of recently described compounds is presented. Different types of energetic materials such as coordination (e. g. [Cu(dtp)(3)](ClO4)(2)and [Fe(MTZ)(6)](ClO4)(2)), neutral (e. g. azidoethanol, 1- and 2-aminotetrazole) and ionic (e. g. polynitropyrazolates and PETNC salts) compounds were investigated and compared to commonly used materials, like RDX, ammonium perchlorate (AP) and azide salts. Furthermore, different substitution patterns and energetic functionalities such as azido-, nitro- and nitramino-groups were investigated.",2021
Photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory studies of N-rich energetic materials,"The geometric and electronic structures of molecular anionic energetic materials (EMs) DAAF (3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azoxyfurazan), FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene), 5,5'-BT (5,5'-bistetrazole), and 1,5'-BT (1,5'-bistetrazole) are explored employing anionic photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The electron binding energies of the observed anionic, energetic material related species are determined and their corresponding anionic structures are assigned. Decomposition reactions for negatively charged EMs can proceed with different energy barriers, and thus mechanisms, from those for their related neutral EMs. Reactivity based on the anionic initial fragments of these EM species further reinforces their respective highly reactive and explosive nature. Fragment ions of the form EM--H-X (X = N-2, N-2(+) NH, ... ) are additionally observed. Detection of such species suggests that EM--H could serve as promising new candidates for EMs, assuming that such species are synthetically available, perhaps as energetic salts. Vertical detachment energies for transitions to the ground and first triplet electronic excited states of neutral matrix dye anion DCM- are additionally determined. Published by AIP Publishing.",2016
Experimental and DFT-D Studies of the Molecular Organic Energetic Material RDX,"We have performed simulations utilizing the dispersion-corrected density functional theory method (DFT-D) as parametrized by Grimme on selected polymorphs of RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine). Additionally, we present the first experimental determination of the enthalpy of fusion (Delta H-fus) of the highly metastable beta-form of RDX. The characteristics of fusion for beta-RDX were determined to be 186.7 +/- 0.8 degrees C, 188.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C, and 12.63 +/- 0.28 kJ mol(-1) for the onset temperature, peak temperature (or melting point), and Delta H-fus, respectively. The difference in experimental Delta Hfus for the alpha- and beta-forms of RDX is 20.46 +/- 0.92 kJ mol(-1). Ambientpressure lattice energies (E-L) of the alpha- and beta-forms of RDX have been calculated and are in excellent agreement with experiment. In addition the computationally predicted difference in E-L (20.35 kJ mol(-1)) between the alpha- and beta forms is in excellent agreement with the experimental difference in Delta H-fus. The response of the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes to pressure for the alpha- and gamma-forms have been investigated, in addition to the first high-pressure computational study of the e-form of RDX- these results are in very good agreement with experimental data Phonon calculations provide good agreement for vibrational frequencies obtained from Raman spectroscopy, and a predicted inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectrum of alpha-RDX shows excellent agreement with experimental INS data determined in this study. The transition energies and intensities are reproduced, confirming that both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the vibrations are correctly described by the DFT-D method. The results of the high-pressure phonon calculations have been used to show that the heat capacities of the alpha-, gamma-, and epsilon -forms of RDX are only weakly affected by pressure.",2013

Elucidating the Mechanisms of Reactions in Energetic Materials: A Critical Methodology Review,"Identification of the mechanism of changes taking place in energetic materials (EMs) is one of the most important issues in the rational design and use of EMs. Due to the extremely rapid nature of these changes, reliable monitoring and real-time analysis are extremely difficult. Hence, analysis of the mechanism of such processes often has to rely on adaptation of classical methods or on comparison of the initial and final states of the EM. In this critical review, we focus on current approaches to the methodology of investigating the mechanisms of processes taking place in EMs, showcasing viable experimental strategies, points of uncertainty, and adaptations of classical instrumental methods.",2024
Force field-inspired transformer network assisted crystal density prediction for energetic materials,"Machine learning has great potential in predicting chemical information with greater precision than traditional methods. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they can automatically learn the features of the molecule from the graph, significantly reducing the time needed to find and build molecular descriptors. However, the application of machine learning to energetic materials property prediction is still in the initial stage due to insufficient data. In this work, we first curated a dataset of 12,072 compounds containing CHON elements, which are traditionally regarded as main composition elements of energetic materials, from the Cambridge Structural Database, then we implemented a refinement to our force field-inspired neural network (FFiNet), through the adoption of a Transformer encoder, resulting in force field-inspired Transformer network (FFiTrNet). After the improvement, our model outperforms other machine learning-based and GNNs-based models and shows its powerful predictive capabilities especially for high-density materials. Our model also shows its capability in predicting the crystal density of potential energetic materials dataset (i.e. Huang & Massa dataset), which will be helpful in practical high-throughput screening of energetic materials.",2023
"CarNit4-A new polymeric energetic material based on poly (1,5-tetrazolediyl)","In this paper, a theoretical design and characterization of a novel nitrogen-rich polymeric material (CarNit4) based on 1,5-tetrazolediyl unit was performed using density functional theory. The theoretical analysis includes crystal structure prediction, estimation of dynamical and mechanical stability of the monoclinic (space group P2(1)) crystal, topological analysis of electron density, band structure and spectral (IR, Raman, UV, NMR) characterization as well as detonation and propulsive properties calculation. The modeling of both the crystalline and amorphous phases reveals high enthalpies of formation and densities. Detonation and propulsive properties of CarNit4 as a single explosive are close to that of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). However, mixing of CarNit4 with oxidants (gaseous O-2) improves sharply the propulsive properties which become much higher than that of RDX. The same effect on detonation velocity and pressure is expected for formulations of CarNit4 with various positive oxygen balance explosives. Decomposition of CarNit4 in the presence of O-2 demonstrates the highest propulsive parameters under oxidation to carbon monoxide rather than carbon dioxide.",2020
Hydrazide Salts of Di-Picric Acid as Dense and Insensitive Energetic Materials,"Energetic dipicrate hydrazide salts were synthesized by combining picric acid (PA) as anion and carbohydrazide and oxalyldihydrazide as cations in stoichiometric amounts (2 : 1 mol ratio). The structures of 2,2'-carbonyldi(hydrazin-1-ium) bispicrate (1) and 2,2'-(1,2-dioxoethane-1,2-diyl)di(hydrazin-1-ium) bispicrate (2) were investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, illustrate that both crystals of 1 and 2 belong to the monoclinic system (space group, C2/c). The prepared salts were thoroughly characterized using NMR, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The detonation velocities and pressures of salts 1 (8.02 km/s, 27.8 GPa) and 2 (8.23 km/s, 30.5 GPa) were computed by using EXPLO5 code. They exhibit high density, acceptable oxygen balance, good detonation properties and admirable thermal stability.",2018
"Computational studies on 1,2,4-Triazolium-based salts as energetic materials","The results of the computational studies performed on 1,2,4-triazolium cation-based salts designed by pairing it with energetic nitro-substituted 5- membered N-heterocyclic anions such as 5-nitrotetrazolate, 3,5-dinitrotriazolate, and 2,4,5 trinitroimidazolate are reported. Condensed phase heats of formation of the designed ionic salts and their thermodynamic and energetic properties have also been calculated. The results show that these salts are potential energetic materials and possess high positive heats of formation. The detonation velocity, D, and detonation pressure, P, have been calculated using the Kamlet-Jacobs equation and found to be 7-8 km/s and 25-29 GPa, respectively. These values fall in the range of the criteria to designate them as high-energy-density materials. Nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) studies performed on the designed molecules show that these salts are stable in nature.",2015
Understanding Limits of the Thermal Mechanism of Laser Initiation of Energetic Materials,"Laser initiation of energetic materials has a potential to:shift a paradigm in the development of novel explosive technologies with a stunningly: broad range of applications. Once interactions of laser irradiation with energetic materials are better understood, dramatically improved safe explosive devices, intricate high precision tools in micromedicine,. miniaturized cutting and drilling tools, synthesis of new promising materials with tailored properties, and fundamentally new concepts of converting energy become possible. We consider the interplay between optical and thermal energies, analyze the applicability of the thermal mechanism of initiation, and estimate the limits of its efficiency in the process of laser initiation of energetic materials. We propose a simple demonstration of a feasibility of nonthermal selective photoinitiation while challenging the widely popular perception of the thermal nature of laser initiation.",2012

The authors propose an approach to synthesize an Al/CuO based nEM that has several advantages over previous investigations such as enhanced contact, reduced impurities and Al oxidation, tailored dimensions, and easier integration into microsystem. CuO nanowires are synthesized by thermally annealing Cu film deposited onto silicon. Nano-Al is integrated with the nanowires to realize an Al/CuO based nEM. The synthesized nEM is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry.",2007
"Dense nitrogen-rich energetic materials: A study of 5,5′-(1","5,5'-(1H-tetrazolyl) amine (BTA), a nitrogen rich molecular solid has been investigated under compression at room temperature. Powder x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation and micro-Raman spectroscopy were carried out to pressures up to 12.9 GPa. BTA conserves the crystalline structure of its room condition phase up to the highest pressure, i.e., an orthorhombic unit cell (Pbca). A fit of the isothermal compression data to the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state reveals the high compressibility of BTA. An analysis of the volume change with pressure yields a bulk modulus and its derivative similar to that of high-nitrogen content molecular crystals. Upon laser heating to approximately 1100 K, the sample decomposed while pressurized at 2.1 GPa, resulting in a graphitic compound. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that the minimum energy conformation is not experimentally observed since a higher energy conformation allows for a more stable dense packing of the BTA molecules.

Peridynamic simulation for the laser ignition model of energetic material with cracks,"The actual ignition process in the artillery barrel is complex, cracks in the energetic materials will inevitably appear due to the influence of various factors, but they are rarely considered in previous experiments and simulations. A laser ignition model of energetic materials considering insulating cracks is constructed. Peridynamic non-Fourier heat conduction numerical scheme is utilized to simulate the laser ignition process of energetic materials with cracks. The applicability of the peridynamic formulation is first verified by comparing the ignition delay time of crack-free energetic material with experimental results. The effects of cracks on ignition delay time in various cases are then investigated mechanistically via simulation results. The results show that cracks affect heat transfer leading to heat accumulation near the crack, which accelerates the temperature rise and shortens the ignition delay time. Moreover, laser power and crack distribution change the influence of cracks on heat transfer. This serves as a numerical reference for the research of the actual launch process in the barrel.",2023
High-Pressure Characterization of Melt-Castable Energetic Materials: Bis(Nitroxymethylisoxazolyl) Furoxan (DNDIF),"The high-pressure behavior of bis(nitroxymethylisoxazolyl) furoxan (DNDIF) was studied at ambient temperature and pressures approaching 30 GPa by Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. There was no evidence of a phase change observed over this pressure range, indicating that the ambient structure of DNDIF remains stable up to conditions similar to the detonation pressure of the material. Such findings suggest that this melt-castable explosive may be used in the replacement of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in energetic formulations without the concern of uncontrolled polymorphism that might otherwise affect the performance and safety of the munition. Additionally, empirical understanding of the effect of different structural motifs in the crystal packing builds on understanding of what macroscale features are desirable for future materials and gets us closer to the design of future novel energetics.",2021
Compatibility study of NaN,"Nitrogen-rich and poly-nitrogen energetic materials have the advantages of high density, high formation enthalpy, and environmentally friendly as new energetic materials. Among them, cyclo-N-5(-) is one of the most representative ionic nitrogen compounds. However, at present, the studies are mainly in the field of synthesis. This study mainly explores the compatibility of NaN5 with traditional energetic materials, hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), and ammonium perchlorate (AP). The compatibility is an important parameter to evaluate the safety and reliability of propellants. Therefore, AP, cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), HTPB were selected to study the compatibility of NaN5 in the means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that NaN5/AP, NaN5/HMX, NaN5/RDX, NaN5/CL-20 have good compatibility, whereas NaN5/HTPB exhibits moderate compatibility.",2020
A kinetics and mechanism study of the thermal decomposition of energetic materials,"The thermal decomposition rates and product distributions have been studied for two groups of compounds: nitro- and difluoramino-substituted six-membered rings and 3,6-disubstituted-1,2,4,5-tetrazines. The mass spectra of these compounds were also examined using electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry (MS). A collision induced dissociation (CID) study of the major EI peaks was carried out using tandem mass spectrometer. The mass fragmentation pathways were constructed and discussed. Geminal-bis(difluoramino) compounds were observed to be slightly more stable than the corresponding geminal dinitro compounds, and they released more heat during decomposition. Where a nitramine functionality was present, the nitroso analog was observed as a major decomposition product. The decomposition pathways of gem-bis(difluoramino) and gem-dinitro compounds exhibited similarities. Both experienced homolytic loss of one NX 2 group followed by the rearrangement of the remaining NX 2 . Where X was oxygen, the well-known nitro/nitrite rearrangement, followed by loss of NO, resulted in a C=O bond. Where X was fluorine, there were two possibilities; loss of fluorine radical leaving C=NF or loss of HNF resulting in =C-F; the latter pathway was the one mainly observed. The mass fragmentation study on these compounds indicated the two nitramines with a six-member ring structure underwent initial loss of a geminal substituent; loss of a nitramine nitro group was the secondary step. The two cyclohexane structures showed similar initial fragmentation pathways, featuring the successive losses of nitro or difluoramino groups. The thermal and electron-impact stabilities of eight 3,6-substituted-1,2,4,5-tetrazines were investigated in the same fashion. Major EI peaks were also investigated by tandem mass techniques to construct fragmentation pathways. No tetrazine ring structures were maintained under electron impact ionization nor under conditions of thermal decomposition. Under electron impact, all the tetrazines examined shared the same initial fragmentation pathways: elimination of two of the nitrogen atoms as N 2 from the tetrazine ring and cleavage of the remaining N-N bond. This pathway was also applicable to thermal decomposition; however, the main route involves dissociation of the substituent on the tetrazine carbon, in some cases assisted by proton transfer.",2000
Stability in closed ecological systems: An examination of material and energetic parameters,"Closed ecological systems (CES) are gas-sealed microcosms. One-liter CES have been shown to maintain life in a consistent manner for over 25 years (Folsome and Hanson, 1986). Operationally, stability was defined as a constant total biomass (live plus dead organic material) for a period exceeding one turnover of all carbon pools. CES differing solely in total concentrations of carbon (30-150 mM), nitrogen (4-13 mM) and phosphorus (0.3-0.9 mM), or in a fundamental aspect of configuration (i.e., gas-open versus true materially-closed microcosms), were compared to determine: (1) which systems attain a stable state; (2) how biomass levels varied relative to material composition; and (3) whether a given stable biomass concentration was related to some unique set drawn from other parameter-defined relations. Twenty-seven of a total of 28 CES prototypes achieved stability in about 60 days. Stable biomass-C levels (typically 10-40 mM) could be described solely as a linear function of the total C concentration. Limiting N concentrations depressed expected biomass levels, whereas limiting P conditions caused an increase in biomass. Limitations in N and P coincided to those predicted by the Redfield biomass C:N:P ratios (106:16:1). Various parameters measured in stable CES, such as detrital-C, live-C, carbon production, respiration, chlorophyll-a concentration, viable counts, and heterotrophic substrate range, were differentially affected by total C, N, and/or P concentrations. Furthermore, for a given radiant energy flux and comparative physical conditions, data showed no unique level of stable biomass, nor was a given biomass level indicative of some unique parameter-defined system configuration. Gas-open systems were similar in most attributes to closed systems except for about a 2- to 6-fold relative increase in detritus, fluctuating biomass levels, and longer time periods necessary for stabilization. These data suggest that laboratory-scale material closure may facilitate ecosystem stability. Overall, results suggest that CES prioritize the establishment of some characteristic bioelemental pool structure over that of energy flux or efficiency of energy utilization. Results also indicate that it should be possible to predictably scale-up small CES as regards technological applications.",1991
Synthesis and properties of azamonocyclic energetic materials with geminal explosophores,"Diversity-oriented synthesis of energetic pyrimidine structures with geminal explosophoric groups of geminal dinitro and azido-nitro groups via a novel reductive cleavage and oxidative coupling strategy is reported. Fluorine has also been introduced for the first time based on the nucleophilic coupling process. The obtained energetic pyrimidines are investigated via X-ray diffraction and theoretical techniques of electrostatic potential and proton affinity calculations. Both experimental and calculation results showed impressive detonation performances and good application prospects of the energetic pyrimidine structures. Among them, DNNC exhibited great promise as a green oxidant in solid propellant formulations to replace ammonium perchlorate (AP). TNHA (rho = 1.79 g cm(-3), D = 8537 m s(-1), P = 32.69 Gpa) and TNHF (rho = 1.85 g cm(-3), D = 8517 m s(-1), P = 32.64 Gpa) proved to be ideal candidates for high explosives due to their high densities and detonation properties.

From this, N-nitrosarcosine was prepared in few steps, which serves as a starting material for the synthesis of oxygen-rich compounds. The compounds were thoroughly characterized including multinuclear NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and also molecular structures by single X-ray diffraction were obtained.

Scale-Up of a Crystallizer for Production of Nano-Sized Energetic Materials,"The outstanding sensitivity of high-energetic materials such as cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) has prompted efforts by researchers in the production of less sensitive explosives by crystallization without compromising performance. One such endeavor is crystal-size reduction to nano-scales. The optimum operating conditions for producing nano-sized RDX were experimentally determined. Based on these results, computational fluid dynamics modeling and simulations were executed for scaleup purposes and identification of the influence of fluid dynamics, mixing, and heat transfer on crystal growth and production rate on commercial scales. As a result, a commercial plant was designed and operation data from the commercial crystallizers were compared with data obtained from scale-up tasks.",2016
Thermal history method for identification of autocatalytic decomposition reactions of energetic materials,"The thermal stability during the autocatalytic decomposition of a material depends on the intrinsic properties of the substance such as its kinetic triplet, in addition to its thermal history. In this reported study, simulations were conducted on select substances using the first-order reaction model (F1) and the general autocatalytic reaction model (Cn). Through changing the initial conversion rate, the thermal history's influence on the dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves was investigated based on the n-order reaction and autocatalytic reaction. A thermal history method for determining the autocatalytic decompositions of four energetic materials were established using the results of Roduit et al. and a simulated combustion. The isothermal DSC measurements and Swiss method were also employed to validate the reliability of the proposed thermal history method. Results of the simulations and experiments indicated that the influence on the dynamic DSC curves was significant based on data in the autocatalytic reactions. Thermal stability was decreased with a lower initial temperature and peak temperature. The influence was more significant on the energetic materials with greater autocatalytic potential. The results of this study indicated that the proposed thermal history method can be successfully used to quickly and effectively identify the autocatalysis characteristics of energetic materials.

Decomposition of Condensed Phase Energetic Materials: Interplay between Uni- and Bimolecular Mechanisms,"Activation energy for the decomposition of explosives is a crucial parameter of performance. The dramatic suppression of activation energy in condensed phase decomposition of nitroaromatic explosives has been an unresolved issue for over a decade. We rationalize the reduction in activation energy as a result of a mechanistic change from unimolecular decomposition in the gas phase to a series of radical bimolecular reactions in the condensed phase. This is in contrast to other classes of explosives, such as nitramines and nitrate esters, whose decomposition proceeds via unimolecular reactions both in the gas and in the condensed phase. The thermal decomposition of a model nitroaromatic explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), is presented as a prime example. Electronic structure and reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-lg) calculations enable to directly probe the condensed phase chemistry under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, identifying the key bimolecular radical reactions responsible for the low activation route. This study elucidates the origin of the difference between the activation energies in the gas phase (similar to 62 kcal/mol) and the condensed phase (similar to 35 kcal/mol) of TNT and identifies the corresponding universal principle. On the basis of these findings, the different reactivities of nitro-based organic explosives are rationalized as an interplay between uni- and bimolecular processes.",2014
Ion-Mobility Spectrometry of Nickel Nanoparticle Oxidation Kinetics: Application to Energetic Materials,"Nanoscaled nickel particles have attracted interest for their potential use as a fuel in energetic materials. In this work, we combined two ion-mobility spectrometry approaches, tandem differential mobility analysis (TDMA) and tandem differential mobility-particle mass analysis (DMA-APM), to study the size-resolved reactivity of nickel nanoparticles. Nickel nanoparticles were generated in situ by using gas-phase thermal pyrolysis of nickel carbonyl. Four particle sizes (40, 62, 81, and 96 nm, mobility size) were then selected by using a differential mobility analyzer. These particles were sequentially oxidized in a flow reactor at various temperatures (25-1100 degrees C). The size and mass change of the size-selected and -reacted particles were then measured by a second DMA, or an APM. We found that both particle size and mass were increased as the temperature increased. However, at higher temperature (600-1100 degrees C), a different mass and size change behavior was observed that could be attributed to a phase transition between NiO and Ni2O3. A shrinking core model employed to extract the size-resolved kinetic parameters shows that the activation energy for oxidation decreased with decreasing particle size. The burning time power dependence on particle size was found to be less than 2 and nickel particles were found to be kinetically more active than aluminum.",2008
Aerosol routes to synthesis of nanoparticles and its application to energetic materials,"Mixtures of fuel and oxidizers with particle sizes in the nanometer range have been widely used for energy intensive applications like propellants and explosives. Nano-Al is invariably used as fuel, while a host of metal oxide nanoparticles are used as oxidizers, such as: Fe 2 O 3 , CuO, MoO 3 , depending on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction. This work describes synthetic procedures for oxidizer nanoparticles via aerosol routes with a fine control on the morphology and oxidative characteristics of the nanoparticles. An aero-sol-gel method has been used for the synthesis of nanoporous Iron oxide nanoparticles with a controlled surface area ranging from 3--200 m 2 /g. A new super-reactive formulation of Al/KMnO 4 has been developed which is a few orders of magnitude more reactive than the traditional formulations of Al/Fe 2 O 3 , Al/MoO 3 and Al/CuO. The nanoenergetic materials were subjected to confined combustion in a pressure vessel and the reactivity was measured in terms of pressurization rate (psi/μs). Difference in characteristic temperature of two components of a composite nanoparticle has been employed to synthesize particles with a core-shell nanostructure. By manipulating, the interfacial area between the fuel and oxidizer particles we have developed methods both to enhance as well as moderate the reactivity of energetic materials in a large dynamic range. The second part of this work describes a simple aerosol model for synthesis of nanoparticles by evaporation/condensation method. A new approach to the solution of the General Dynamic Equation (GDE) based on a nodal method has been used. The model solution described is suitable for problems involving gas to particle conversion due to homogeneous nucleation, coagulation, and surface growth of particles via evaporation/condensation of monomers. The important features of the model is that it is simple to comprehend, the software which we call Nodal GDE Solver (NGDE) is relatively compact, and the code is well documented internally, so that users may apply it to their specific needs or make modifications as required. The solution presented here describes the solution of the problem and our approach for both constant and size-dependent surface tension.",2005
Investigation of Energetic Materials and Plasmonic Nanostructures Using Advanced Electron Microscopic Techniques,"Investigation of laser-matter interaction has been an important research topic which is closely related to applications in various fields including industry, military, electronics, photonics, etc. With the advent of ultrafast transmission electron microscope (UTEM), in situ investigation of the interaction between pulsed laser and nanostructured materials becomes accessible, with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we studied two categories of materials with the help of UTEM, namely, energetic materials and plasmonic nanostructures. The results demonstrate that UTEM provides a novel and convenient way for the investigation the structural and morphological change of energetic materials under external stimuli at nanoscale. Also, UTEM makes it possible to visualize the light-induced welding between plasmonic nanostructures at real time, which helps to reveal more details about the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, we studied the formation of some novel structures by combing different gold and silver nanostructure.",2018
Density-based kinetics for mesoscale simulations of detonation initiation in energetic materials,"In this work we present one-and two-dimensional mesoscale simulations of detonation initiation in energetic materials. We solve the reactive Euler equations, with the energy equation augmented by a power deposition term. The reaction rate at the mesoscale is modelled using a density-based kinetics scheme, adapted from standard 'Ignition and Growth' models. The deposition term is based on previous results of simulations of void collapse at the microscale, modelled at the mesoscale as hot spots. For an isolated hot spot in a homogeneous medium, it is found that a critical size of the hot spots exists. If the hot spots exceed the critical size, initiation of detonation can be achieved. For sub-critical hot-spot sizes, we show that it takes a collection of hot spots to achieve detonation. We also carry out two-dimensional mesoscale simulations of random packs of HMX crystals in a binder, and show that the transition between no detonation and detonation depends on the number density of the hot spots, the initial radius of the hot spot, the post-shock pressure of an imposed shock, and the amplitude of the power deposition term.",2017
Determination of energetic materials in soil using multivariate analysis of Raman spectra.,"Contamination of soils by energetic materials (EMs) is an important issue in many locations (such as test mounds, ordnance depots, and manufacturing sites). Raman spectroscopy can be useful as a screening technique at the percent level (by mass) if interference from soil fluorescence can be overcome. Multivariate analysis is shown capable of both extracting the Raman signatures of EMs from spectra obscured by large fluorescence backgrounds caused by soil components, and generating calibration curves for the EMs at the percent level.",-Feb
Manufacturing and performance of nanometric Al/MoO,"Nanometric powders of aluminum (Al) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) have been combined to create an inorganic energetic material. When optimized, the burn rate of these materials (similar to 400 m/s) exceeds that of conventional thermites (based on micron-sized powders), but is less than that of conventional explosives. Similar burn rates around 350 m/s are measured for these ""superthermites"" using n-Al powder in the size range between 30 and 90 nm in diameter (20-60 m(2)/g, 60-80 wt % Al) and an oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio of 1.4. The burn rate decreases when the surface area of the MoO3 is decreased from 64 to 40 m(2)/g, or when oxygen to fuel is changed from 1.2. Thus, for each average particle diameter, there is an optimum burn rate at an oxygen-to-fuel ratio that depends on the wt % Al present in the material and the particle size distribution of the powder. The burn rate is dependent on several materials and processing factors such as the quality of the nanometric ingredients, the processing method, and exposure to air and light, so the effect of aging and environmental exposure on the individual ingredients has been investigated. The results of this powder aging study suggests that the surface area of n-MoO3 can decrease twofold within 10-12 days, and the Al-metal content in n-Al can decrease as much as 50% over two years. Adequate handling and storage procedures must therefore be followed for the effective use of nanometric powders and their superthermite mixes.",2007
Periodate-Based Perovskite Energetic Materials: A Strategy for High-Energy Primary Explosives,"The requirements for high energy and green primary explosives are more and more stringent because of the rising demand in the application of micro initiation explosive devices. Four new energetic compounds with powerful initiation ability are reported and their performances are experimentally proven as designed, including non-perovskites ([H(2)DABCO](H4IO6)(2)center dot 2H(2)O, named TDPI-0) and perovskitoid energetic materials (PEMs) ([H(2)DABCO][M(IO4)(3)]; DABCO=1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, M=Na+, K+, and NH4+ for TDPI-1, -2, and -4, respectively). The tolerance factor is first introduced to guide the design of perovskitoid energetic materials (PEMs). In conjunction with [H(2)DABCO](ClO4)(2)center dot H2O (DAP-0) and [H(2)DABCO][M(ClO4)(3)] (M=Na+, K+, and NH4+ for DAP-1, -2, and -4), the physiochemical properties of the two series are investigated between PEMs and non-perovskites (TDPI-0 and DAP-0). The experimental results show that PEMs have great advantages in improving the thermal stability, detonation performance, initiation capability, and regulating sensitivity. The influence of X-site replacement is illustrated by hard-soft-acid-base (HSAB) theory. Especially, TDPIs possess much stronger initiation capability than DAPs, which indicates that periodate salts are in favor of deflagration-to-detonation transition. Therefore, PEMs provide a simple and feasible method for designing advanced high energy materials with adjustable properties.",2023
Predicting impact sensitivity of energetic materials: insights from energy transfer of carriers,"The impact sensitivity to external stimuli is a critical parameter to evaluate and design high-performance energetic materials (EMs). Investigating factors that affect sensitivity and further revealing the sensitivity mechanism are still huge challenges. In the present study, a physical model is established to assess im-pact sensitivity of 16 energetic compounds based on the energy transfer of carriers using first-principles calculation. The results show that the empirical parameter ,/r obtained by considering the band gap, the density of states, and the ability of electronic migration has a remarkable correlation with experimen-tal drop energy E 50 . This is in favor of the basic assumption that the energetic material would be less sensitive if the electrons transfer energies quickly to other molecules, making it harder to form a hot spot.

The role of regioisomerism on thermal stability of furoxan based energetic materials,"Development of high-performance energetic materials with good stabilities has been a great challenge, since such materials essentially suffer from high sensitivities. Regioisomerism, as an effective modification strategy for molecular properties, presents impacts on thermal stabilities of energetic materials. In this study, the effects of regioisomerism on thermal stabilities of a pair of furoxan based energetic materials (M3 and M4) have been thoroughly investigated. The initial decomposition mechanisms of the regioisomers are fully discussed, the NO2-dissociation path is proved as the primary decomposition path, instead of the previously reported ring-open channel. An unusual transition state is found for the NO2- dissociation path, due to the existence of Van der Waals potential well, which attributes to the strong weak interaction between the dissociation products. The regioisomerism has impacts on both molecular structures and decomposition mechanisms of M3 and M4. The existence of intramolecular weak interactions and the electron effects contribute to the molecular stability of M4. The elevation in the energy barrier of initial decomposition path of M4, and the decline in the energy of dissociation products of M3, result in different thermal stabilities of M3 and M4.

The preparation and properties of AP-based nano-limit growth energetic materials,"AP-based nano-limit growth energetic materials(NLGEM) were prepared by using SiO2 gel as nano-limit growth skeleton materials and using sol-gel method combining solution crystallization to make AP recrystallized in the nanopores of SiO2 gel skeleton to form AP/SiO2 NLGEM. The chemical and physical structure and properties of AP/SiO2 NLGEM were studied in detail. AP with nanoscale particles size range from 69nm to108nm was recrystallized in the pore of SiO2 gel skeleton and the particle size of AP increased with the amount of AP in NLGEM increasing. Moreover, the preparation method didn't change the crystal form of AP and bring impurities to NLGEM. The decomposition of AP/SiO2 NLGEM was a one-step process, which was indicated its decomposition was more concentrate than pure AP and AP/SiO2 simple physical mixture (AP/SiO2 SPM), whose decomposition was a two-step process. At the time, the decomposition heat of AP/SiO2 NLGEM was higher than that of pure AP and AP/SiO2 SPM. The sensitivity of AP/SiO2 NLGEM was lower than those of the pure energetic components and physical mixtures according to the impact sensitivity test.",2014
Towards non-invasive detection of concealed energetic materials in-field under ambient light conditions,"Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) is demonstrated for the non-contact detection of energetic materials concealed within non-transparent, diffusely scattering containers. A modified design of an inverse SORS probe has been developed and tested. The SORS probe has been successfully used for the detection of various energetic substances inside different types of plastic containers. The tests have been successfully conducted under incandescent and fluorescent background lights as well as under daylight conditions, using a non-contact working distance of 6 cm. The interrogation times for the detection of the substances were less than 1 minute in each case, highlighting the suitability of the device for near real-time detection of concealed hazards in the field. The device has potential applications in forensic analysis and homeland security investigations.",2011
Constructing Single- or Dual-Layer Biomass Composite Energetic Material through Self-Assembly of Biomass Polyphenol Structural Materials,"High energy and high risk have always restricted the application of materials in the military and civilian fields. To achieve this goal, researchers have studied the structural characteristics and structure-activity relationship of biomass polyphenol material to obtain core-shell biomass polyphenol composite energetic materials through molecular and structural design. The interface structure has a significant impact on the safety performance and thermal stability of energetic materials. The unique advantages of natural biomass polyphenol chemistry (tannic acid and tea polyphenols) include the structural design and performance control of energetic materials. This paper provides a review of the preparation of core-shell biomass polyphenol energetic materials, which involve the use of polyphenols as the shell layer, surface modification layer, and intermediate layer to enhance intermolecular interactions. This approach aims to enhance the thermal stability and reduce the sensitivity. Furthermore, the paper offers suggestions for potential future research directions based on the findings.",2024
Covalently Tethered Assemblies Improve Energetic Homogeneity and Exciton Transport in Organic Materials,"Structural and functional heterogeneity is a consequence of the weak noncovalent interactions that direct the formation of organic materials from solution precursors. While covalent tethering of solution-phase assemblies provides a compelling strategy to enhance intermolecular order, the effects of this tethering strategy on the formed solid-state materials remain unestablished. This work uses pump-probe microscopy to compare excited-state dynamics in thin films fabricated from tethered perylene bisimide assemblies to those fabricated from noncovalent assemblies. On average, tethered films exhibit faster and more homogeneous excited-state lifetimes, consistent with stronger and more uniform intermolecular coupling. Optical measurements of excited-state diffusion show that the tethered film has similar to 75% faster transport than the control film. Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling suggests that the reduction of site energetic disorder is sufficient to quantitatively explain the difference in diffusion coefficients. These results provide strong support that covalent tethering is a promising strategy to enhance the structural and energetic ordering in molecular materials.",2024
Diagnostics Development for and Study of Energetic Materials Subject to Shock Loading,"A wide range of shock physics experiments require a high pressure, 2D-planar shock with pressure and temporal uniformity. Researchers, traditionally, would utilize a gas gun facility or high explosive plane wave lens. These techniques have several limitations. Gun facilities have high facility cost and long experiment times. Legacy fast-slow explosive lenses require labor intensive and high risk, high precision pressed or casted and, subsequently, machined explosives. Any design changes made with the explosives in such traditional lenses leads to significant increases in cost and time. Previous groups demonstrated that inert waveguides can generate a planar shock using only a single explosive formulation. These inert or Fritz plane wave lenses also have significantly lower net explosive weight and can be printed in parallel as opposed to single machining operations. By utilizing 3D printing and hydrodynamic modeling, a wide design space was explored experimentally and computationally to optimize the pressure and temporal uniformity of lenses. Statistical design of experiments was used to visualize and interpret an extensive set of simulations to inform experimental geometries. Using a cast cure explosive formulation, 3D printed lenses were fabricated at the 1” and 2” diameter scale. Lenses were evaluated using streak photography and photon Doppler velocimetry. Results of simulations and experiments illustrate key design parameters including the waveguide contour radius and explosive formulation composition. After calibration and geometry optimization, lenses had a temporal and pressure uniformity of < 50 ns and < 3 GPa respectively. Simulations and experiments were conducted to control the shock-to-detonation transition by energy trapping in localized regions of nitromethane that contained arrays of embedded dense particles (tantalum rods). The localizations were additively manufactured and designed. with simulations carried out with ALE3D, that used the ignition and growth reactive flow model for the explosive. Modelling demonstrated enhanced reactivity when the tantalum rods were present, leading to a detonation that otherwise did not occur for the same strength shock without rods. Experiments that confirmed predictions of the simulation were conducted using Fritz plane wave lenses to drive various input shocks into the system. Photon doppler velocimetry was the primary diagnostic used to measure shock input and reaction progression. These results suggest that it is possible design explosives to localize sensitivity to shock loading within an insensitive material increasing the overall safety of fielded energetic materials.Simulations and experiments were conducted to control energy released during explosive corner turning within localized regions of nitromethane. These localized geometries were additively manufactured and tuned based on simulations carried out in ALE3D. High explosive ignition and growth reactive flow modeling identified specific high impedance inclusion geometries for given donor-acceptor charge geometries that would induce corner turning when present. Synthetic, pressure-dependent streak camera images were generated in simulations to inform experimental results. Experiments were conducted using Fritz plane wave lenses to drive planar input shocks into the system. Ultra-high-speed framing and streak camera imaging was used to view shock time of arrivals within manufactured metamaterials. Framing camera images revealed localized instabilities within the nitromethane that were not present in untuned experiments. Streak camera imaging was used to measure corner turning time of arrival at the boundaries of the experimental geometry. Corner turning did not occur in simulations or experiments that did not include the tuned inclusions. These results suggest that it is possible to localize sensitivity to detonation within an insensitive material increasing the overall safety of fielded energetic materials. To date plastic bonded explosives used in commercial, military, and research have been largely formulated using slurry coating. There are ongoing initiatives to replace per- and polyfluorinated substances. The question is how to replace these in various energetic formulations without sacrificing safety and performance. Spray drying is an alternative processing technique that can provide several advantages to slurry coating. Unlike some forms of slurry coating, spray drying does not require a fluorinated working fluid. Spray drying does not require the use of water and is easily adapted to processing under inert atmospheres, allowing for a wider range of compatibility for additives. Cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) was spray dried with Viton A-100 and with Estane-5703 to serve as direct comparisons to PBXN-5 and LX-14, respectively. The resultant molding powders were tested for impact, electrostatic discharge, and friction sensitivity. Spray-dried formulations were found to be less impact sensitive than commercially obtained PBXN-5 and LX-14. Electrostatic discharge and friction sensitivity were found to be sufficiently low to classify molding powders as secondary explosives. The disk acceleration experiment was conducted on pressed samples to measure detonation velocity and CJ-pressure. Results are compared to commercially obtained PBXN-5 and LX-14 pressed to similar densities.A small detonation chamber was designed, manufactured, and tested to facilitate near field imaging of detonation driven experiments. The chamber was constructed from 0.50” thick mild steel and has feedthroughs for both fiber optic instrumentation and high voltage cables. The chamber was equipped with viewing ports on the front, top, left, and right side for ultra-high-speed imaging and illumination. Qualification testing was conducted to rate the chamber to a working mass of 5 grams of trinitrotoluene. Thick and thin flyer plates were found to minimally damage the interior of the chamber. Blast overpressure testing found no damage to the chamber and optical viewports and minimal damage to feed throughs. Explosive spall damage was investigated due to unintentional contact with the chamber walls and found to induce moderate damage with potential equipment damage if not protected against.",2024
Direct observations of ultrasonically generated hot spots in polymer composite energetic materials,"Thermally dissipated energy from periodic mechanical action can lead to the creation of areas of intense, localized heating in heterogeneous composite materials, called hot spots. Measurements of hot spots have been performed in shock, impact, and friction studies of energetic materials, amongst others. In this work, high-frequency contact loading allows for the controlled development of hot spots near explosive crystals embedded in polymer with temperature gradients suitable for shadowgraph visualization. Heat dissipation initiated the delamination of crystal-binder interfaces, which led to increased heating from interfacial motion and further delamination propagation. A variety of explosives were considered. Low melting point explosives were driven to reaction despite a hypothesized reduction in interfacial friction upon melting, and crystals with controlled surface morphology still experienced damage. Shadowgraphy allows nonintrusive access to internally developing hot spots which, in turn, enables the identification of heat generation mechanisms to inform our understanding of explosive initiation.

Novel X-Ray and Optical Diagnostics for Studying Energetic Materials: A Review,"Thermomechanical, physical, and chemical processes in energetic materials (EMs) during manufacturing and processing or under external stimuli such as shock compression, involve multiple temporal and spatial scales. Discovering novel phenomena, acquiring new data, and understanding underlying mechanisms all require temporally and spatially resolved diagnostics. Here, we present a brief review of novel diagnostics that are either emerging or have existed but rarely been applied to EMs, including two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) X-ray imaging, X-ray diffraction, coherent X-ray diffraction imaging, small angle X-ray scattering, terahertz and optical absorption/emission spectroscopy, and one-dimensional (1D) and 2D laser-based velocity/displacement interferometry. Typical spatial scales involved are lattice (nanometer and micrometer) and typical temporal scales (femtosecond, picosecond, nanosecond, microsecond, and millisecond). The targeted scientific questions and engineering problems include defects, strengths, deformations, hot spots, phase changes, reactions, and shock sensitivities. Basic principles of measurement and data analysis, and illustrative examples of these are presented. Advanced measurements and experimental complexities also necessitate further development in corresponding data analysis and interpretation methodologies, and multiscale modeling.

Initiation of the Decomposition of a Semi-Transparent Mixture of Energetic Materials,"In this paper, we propose a model for the heating and decomposition of a binary mixture of energetic materials by a short laser pulse which takes into account melting and the formation of a two-phase zone and the decomposition reaction of the individual components of the mixture. A binary solution of furazanotetrazine-dioxide (C2N6O3) and dinitrazapentane (C3H8N4O4) was studied as a model system. The pressure change in the reaction zone was calculated, and the effect of pressure on the rate of decomposition reactions was examined. Numerical investigations were performed to study the dynamics of the process and determine the main stages of the process: melting, the propagation of reaction zones in the mixture, the rapid development of an explosion or the termination of reactions, depending on the amount of stored energy. The influence of the optical properties of the mixture on the initiation dynamics was demonstrated.",2018
Simultaneous Imaging and Spectroscopy of Detonation Interaction in Reactive and Energetic Materials,"A dual framing camera system was coupled with custom-designed ultrafast imaging spectrometer optics to yield simultaneous imaging and imaging spectroscopy of extremely short detonation interaction events in reactive materials. For short exposures of 100ns or less, spectral resolutions of 2.4 angstrom are achievable, allowing for time-resolved identification of key intermediate species evolving from prompt reaction. Under some circumstances, emission can be fit to a local emission temperature, assuming the optically thin limit. Applications to reactive metal systems involving aluminum, magnesium, titanium, boron, and silicon are demonstrated.",2017
The Use of Glass Anvils in Drop-Weight Studies of Energetic Materials,"Conventional impact sensitiveness machines (e.g. Rotter and BAM) do not provide detailed information about hot-spot ignition mechanisms in energetic materials. To gain further insight, a glass anvil technique was developed at Cambridge in the early 1950s, which allowed high-speed photographic studies to be performed during impact on energetic liquids, explosive powders and crystals. Herein we review such investigations which continue up to the present day.",2015
"A thermomechanical analysis of hot spot formation in condensed-phase, energetic materials","This research studies the formation and growth to detonation of hot spots in porous, energetic materials by shock wave. The condensed-phase and gas-phase governing equations, and the initial and the interface conditions are derived, in which, a viscoplastic pore collapse analysis is established to include important processes such as viscoplastic heating, finite-rate gas chemical effects, mass transfer, surface decomposition of the pore, and heat exchange between the pore gas and surrounding material. The governing equations are then simplified by an integral method and the use of average properties in gas phase. Two gas-phase reaction mechanisms are used, one having a finite-rate, one-step process, and another involving 167 elementary reactions and 43 chemical species. The governing equations together with the initial and interface conditions are solved numerically for a series of test cases for RDX (C$\sb3$H$\sb6$N$\sb6$O$\sb6$), as well as PBX9404 (C$\sb{1.40}$H$\sb{2.75}$N$\sb{2.57}$O$\sb{2.69}$Cl$\sb{0.03}$P$\sb{0.01}$) in the case of pulse shock loading. The results show that the viscoplastic pore collapse hot spot model is feasible for shock initiation of porous, energetic materials. Viscoplastic heating is an effective mechanism in the ignition of shocked reactive materials. In addition, it is demonstrated that the initial porosity of the material, the initial pore inner radius, the material viscosity and yield strength have strong influence on the hot spot formation. When the pore collapse velocity is large, the viscous work is the dominant heating source. Compared to single reaction, the multiple gas-phase reactions demonstrates a two-tier induction stage prior to pore explosion. The agreement between the results of calculations and experiments is good.",1991
Predicting the thermal decomposition temperature of energetic materials from a simple model,"ContextThe key factor in designing heat-resistant energetic materials is their thermal sensitivity. Further research and prediction of thermal sensitivity remains a great challenge for us. This study is based on first-principles calculations and establishes a theoretical model, which comprehensively considers band gap, density of states, and Young's modulus to obtain a empirical parameter Psi. A quantitative relationship was established between the new parameter and the thermal decomposition temperature. The value of Psi is calculated for 10 energetic materials and is found to have a strong correlation with the experimental thermal decomposition temperature. This further proves the reliability of our model. Specifically, the larger the value of Psi, the higher the thermal decomposition temperature, and the more stable the energetic material will be. Therefore, to some extent, we can use the new parameter Psi calculated by the model to predict thermal sensitivity. MethodsBased on first-principles, this paper used the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) module of Materials Studio (MS) for calculations. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals in Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) method as well as the Grimme dispersion correction was used in this paper.",2024
Visco-energetic solutions for a model of crack growth in brittle materials,"Visco-energetic solutions have been recently advanced as a new solution concept for rate-independent systems, alternative to energetic solutions/ quasistatic evolutions and balanced viscosity solutions. In the spirit of this novel concept, we revisit the analysis of the variational model proposed by Francfort and Marigo for the quasi-static crack growth in brittle materials, in the case of antiplane shear. In this context, visco-energetic solutions can be constructed by perturbing the time incremental scheme for quasistatic evolutions by means of a viscous correction inspired by the term introduced by Almgren, Taylor, and Wang in the study of mean curvature flows. With our main result we prove the existence of a visco-energetic solution with a given initial crack. We also show that, if the cracks have a finite number of tips evolving smoothly on a given time interval, visco-energetic solutions comply with Griffith's criterion.",2024
Constructing Strategies and Applications of Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Metal-Organic Framework Materials,"The synthesis of energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs) with one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures is an effective strategy for developing new-generation high-energy-density and insensitive materials. The basic properties, models, synthetic strategies and applications of EMOF materials with nitrogen-rich energetic groups as ligands are reviewed. In contrast with traditional energetic materials, EMOFs exhibit some interesting characteristics, like tunable structure, diverse pores, high-density, high-detonation heat and so on. The traditional strategies to design EMOF materials with ideal properties are just to change the types and the size of energetic ligands and to select different metal ions. Recently, some new design concepts have come forth to produce more EMOFs materials with excellent properties, by modifying the energetic groups on the ligands and introducing highly energetic anion into skeleton, encapsulating metastable anions, introducing templates and so on. The paper points out that appropriate constructing strategy should be adopted according to the inherent characteristics of different EMOFs, by combining with functional requirements and considering the difficulties and the cost of production. To promote the development and application of EMOF materials, the more accurate and comprehensive synthesis, systematic performance measurement methods, theoretical calculation and structure simulation should be reinforced.",2020
Prediction of the Crystal Packing of Di-Tetrazine-Tetroxide (DTTO) Energetic Material,"Previous calculations suggested that di-tetrazine-tetroxide (DTTO), aka tetrazino-tetrazine-tetraoxide, might have a particularly large density (2.3 g/cm(3)) and high energy release (8.8 kJ/kg), but it has not yet been synthesized successfully. We report here density functional theory (DFT) (M06, B3LYP, and PBE-ulg) on 20 possible isomers of DTTO. For the two most stable isomers, c1 and c2 we predict the best packings (i.e., polymorphs) among the 10 most common space groups for organic molecular crystal using the Universal force field and Dreiding force field with Monte Carlo sampling. This was followed by DFT calculations at the PBE-ulg level to optimize the crystal packing. We conclude that the c1 isomer has the P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group with a density of 1.96 g/cm(3), while the c2 isomer has the Pbca space group with a density of 1.98 g/cm(3). These densities are among the highest of current energetic materials, RDX (1.81 g/cm(3)) and CL20 (2.01 g/cm(3)). We observe that the stability of the polymorphs increases with the density while the planarity decreases. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016

Behavior of Energetic Materials in Ground Water at an Anti-Tank Range,"An environmental issue his arisen with M-72 malfunction on anti-tink ranges because many of these rockets break into pieces without exploding on impact, dispersing their energetic materials content on the ground surface and exposing them to transport by infiltration of rainfall and snowmelt. A case study (1998-2005) at Arnhem Anti-Tank Range (Garrison Valcartier, Canada, in operation since the 1970s) revealed octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMM) contamination and traces of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in ground water at varying concentrations, with all detected HMX concentrations below the USEPA guideline for drinking water of 400 mu g L-1. An HMX mass balance on a transect perpendicular to ground water flow, about 300 m downgradient of the impact area, indicated an HMX flux of about 3 g d(-1) (0.7-1 kg yr(-1), 2005). The HMX mass in the impact area on the sand terrace was estimated at 7 to 10 kg (in 2005). The annual dissolved HMX flux represents about 10% of the source. The dissolved HMX plume in ground water consisted of a series of slugs, generated at each significant infiltration event. HMX is weakly retarded by sorption and is neither biotransformed nor mineralized under the aerobic conditions of the aquifer. TNT and RDX exceeded the USEPA guideline (2 mu g L-1 RDX and 1 mu g L-1 TNT) in three mid two samples, respectively. The TNT Plume was discontinuous because this Compound was nor always present at the ground surface. TNT is biotransformed, weakly sorbed, and not mineralized. In two wells, perchlorate associated with the propellant was Found at concentrations above the Health Canada preliminary guideline of 6 mu g L-1 near the firing position.",2009
Theoretical study on initial decomposition paths of energetic materials featuring RDX ring,"The molecular properties of RDX are affected by the introduction of different functional groups, and the decomposition process of these analogues is studied in this paper. DFT method is used to study the initial decomposition reaction paths of 30 high energy materials based RDX skeleton. In the nitro cleavage reaction, the energy barrier become relatively low by introducing CH(NO2)(2) or -C(NO2)(3) groups on the C site of the six membered ring. In the ring opening reaction, the ring opening process is easier to proceed by introducing -NH2 or -NHNH2 groups on the C site of the six membered ring.",2024
Surface Modification of Space Exposed Materials Induced by Low Energetic Proton Irradiation,"The aim of this paper is to verify if commonly occurring space debris materials change their reflectivity and morphology after being exposed to low energy protons. Therefore, a set of six different materials frequently used in spacecraft engineering was irradiated with low energy (100 keV) protons to simulate the aging of their surfaces due to space radiation in low Earth orbit (LEO). A microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of the irradiated samples reveals that the tested materials containing organic polymers (Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP)) show changes in surface morphology. Metallic surfaces did not show surface modifications but we found changes in the reflectivity of coated polyimide sheets, like used in Multi Layer Insulation blankets, during and after proton irradiation. Our results show that space materials exhibit significant changes after irradiation equivalent to the dose accumulated after 100 years in LEO. This knowledge is highly relevant for the interpretation of optical data related to the observation of space debris as well as to studies about laser-matter interaction for laser-based debris removal.",
In-situ high pressure study of hydrogen-bonded energetic material N-nitropyrazole,"The study investigated the behavior of N-nitropyrazole (1-NP, C3H3N3O2) under high pressure using a diamond anvil cell, Raman spectroscopy, and simulation calculations. The pressure-volume relationship of the sample, molecular interactions, and changes in optical Raman were analyzed. The Raman experiments revealed abnormal vibration intensities and a discontinuity in peak position at 2.2 GPa. For instance, the C-H stretching vibration produces a new vibration peak under pressure, and the NO2 torsion mode continues to red shift beyond 2.2 GPa. These observations suggest that the crystal's phase transition results from the distortion of its hydrogen-bonded network structure. The pressure relief experiment confirms the reversibility of the phase transition.",2024
All-Nitrogen Energetic Material Cubic Gauche Polynitrogen: Plasma Synthesis and Thermal Performance,"Numerous theoretical calculations have demonstrated that polynitrogen with an extending polymeric network is an ultrahigh-energy all-nitrogen material. Typical samples, such as cubic gauche polynitrogen (cg-N), have been synthesized, but the thermal performance of polynitrogen has not been unambiguously determined. Herein, macroscopic samples of polynitrogen were synthesized utilizing a coated substrate, and their thermal decomposition behavior was investigated. Polynitrogen with carbon nanotubes was produced using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method and characterized using infrared, Raman, X-ray diffraction X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. The results showed that the structure of the deposited polynitrogen was consistent with that of cg-N and the amount of deposition product obtained with coated substrates increased significantly. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at various heating rates and TG-DSC-FTIR-MS analyses were performed. The thermal decomposition temperature of cg-N was determined to be 429 degrees C. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of cg-N calculated by the Kissinger and Ozawa equations was 84.7 kJ/mol and 91.9 kJ/mol, respectively, with a pre-exponential constant (lnAk) of 12.8 min-1. In this study, cg-N was demonstrated to be an all-nitrogen material with good thermal stability and application potential to high-energy-density materials.",2024
A Dihydrazone as a Remarkably Nitrogen-Rich Thermostable and Insensitive Energetic Material,"Hydrogenbonds (H-bonds) in energetic compounds have a very pronouncedeffect on physicochemical properties such as density, thermal stability,sensitivity, and solubility. Now a strategy to synthesize nitrogen-richenergetic materials with overall good properties, which stem fromthe synergetic effects of inter- or intramolecular H-bonds, is reported.1,2-Dihydrazono-1,2-di(1H-tetrazol-5-5-yl)ethane(4), a new thermostable and insensitive material, isobtained from the reaction of dioxime (2) with hydrazinehydrate. The exchange of the oxime (NOH) with the hydrazone (NNH2) functionality results in the reduced acidic character andlow solubility in water, which make it remarkably suitable for practicaluse. While the detonation velocity of 4 is comparablewith RDX, it has an advantage of high nitrogen content (76%) and highthermal stability (275 & DEG;C) and is insensitive toward externalstimuli.",2023
Characterization of encapsulated energetic materials for trace explosives aids for scent (TEAS),"Encapsulation is proposed as a safer way of handling energetic materials. Different encapsulation methods for explosives, such as solvent evaporation, spray coating and supercritical carbon dioxide assisted encapsulation, were explored. Explosive training aids, where energetic materials, such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP), erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) and trinitrotoluene (TNT), are encapsulated in a polymer matrix were developed, followed by comprehensive quality control testing, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis-infrared spectroscopy (TGA-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and sensitivity testing, and finally field approved by canine units trained on the pure explosive.",2022
Search for stable cocrystals of energetic materials using the evolutionary algorithm USPEX,"Creating effective explosives with improved performance and physical properties is a challenging task. There are different methods to achieve this - creating completely new individual high-energy compounds or changing the characteristics of the already known ones. Cocrystallization is one of the ways to improve the critical properties of energetic materials. In this work we show that the crystal structure of stable molecular crystals and cocrystals of energetic molecules can be studied using the evolutionary algorithm USPEX coupled with forcefields orab initiocalculations. Here we show this through tests on PETN, TNT, HMX, CL-20, and TATB, and we separately consider the following compositions of cocrystals: DNDAP + CL-20 (4 : 8) and BTF + CL-20 (4 : 4). As a result, we found cocrytals of the previously known compositions and also novel cocrystals, which might also be stable in the experiment.",2020
Energetic Metal-Organic Frameworks Incorporating NH,"Energetic metal-organic frameworks (E-MOFs) have witnessed increasing development over the past several years. However, as a highly energetic cation, NH3OH+ has never been explored to construct transition-metal-based E-MOFs. Herein, we report the first examples of NH3OH+-containing E-MOFs with bis(tetrazole)methane (H(2)btm) as a ligand and copper and manganese as central metal ions, [(NH3OH)(2)(Cu(btm)(2))] and [(NH3OH)(2)(Mn(btm)(2))](n). Crystal structure determinations reveal that both E-MOFs show two-dimensional layered structures. Experimental results suggest that they have high thermal decomposition temperatures (>200 degrees C). Among them, Cu-based E-MOFs possesses outstanding thermal stability (T-dec = 230.3 degrees C), which surpasses those of known NH3OH+-containing compounds. They also have high energy density; in particular, the Cu-based E-MOF affords a high heat of combustion (11447 kJ kg(-1)) and high heat of detonation (713.8 kJ mol(-1)) beyond the most powerful organic explosives in use today. Additionally, the two E-MOFs show completely different sensitivity properties: the Mn-based E-MOF is an insensitive high-energy-density material (IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N; EDS > 20 J), while the Cu-based E-MOF can be classified as a sensitive energetic material (IS = 13 J; FS = 216 N; EDS = 10.25 J), demonstrating their diverse applications in different fields. Our research proposes a unique class of high-energy-density materials.",2019
PROTECTION AGAINST SHAPED CHARGE BY REACTIVE ARMORS CONTAINING ENERGETIC AND INERT MATERIALS,"Explosive reactive armor (ERA) is the most effective measure to defeat shaped charge warheads except for some drawbacks such as safety and damage. For these reasons, numerous studies on non-explosive reactive armor have been conducted. In this study, a series of ballistic tests against a shaped charge were performed to compare the effectiveness of several interlayer materials and to investigate the shaped charge jet behavior during and after penetration using flash radiograph. The considered materials are NBR, Dyneema HB26, and two non-detonating energetic materials. The materials were sandwiched between two metal plates and assembled as cassettes. Protection performances of the cassettes were analyzed with their mass efficiencies, and dynamic behaviors against shaped charge jet were investigated in terms of jet incidence angles, cassette deformation, length of leading jet and jet distortion time. The results indicate that the two non-detonating energetic materials are superior to NBR and Dyneema HB26 as an interlayer.",2013
Probing the Dynamics of Ultra-Fast Condensed State Reactions in Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials (EMs) are substances with a high amount of stored energy and the ability to release that energy at a rapid rate. Nanothermites and green organic energetics are two classes of EMs which have gained significant interest as they each have desirable properties over traditional explosives. These systems also possess downfalls, which could potentially be overcome if more were understood about the nature of their reactions. However, ultra-fast reactions are prominent during ignition and combustion, and increase the difficulty in probing the initial and intermediate reaction steps. The goal of this study is to probe the early phases of reaction in nanothermites and green EMs, and to do so we have developed a Temperature-Jump/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (T-Jump/TOFMS) capable of rapid sampling and heating rates. Various nanothermites have been investigated with this system, and analysis has shown that nanothermite ignition is dependent on the decomposition of the metal oxide, and in certain systems there is distinct evidence of condensed phase initiation. Carbon/metal oxide mixtures, which have application to chemical looping combustion, were also investigated and further demonstrate condensed phase reaction. Aside from mass spectrometry, complementary high heating rate SEM/TEM, pressure cell, and optical experiments were also performed. Many organic energetics including a variety of tetrazole containing ionic salts have also been examined. To investigate the breakdown of the tetrazole ring, a common substructure in green organic energetics, several tetrazole containing salts with minor variations in either functional group or anion composition were studied. Two main tetrazole decomposition pathways were identified and are affected by the placement of functional groups along the tetrazole ring. Many differences were also observed in comparison to previous works at slow heating rates due to either different reaction processes or the presence of secondary reactions in the previous studies. A µ-DSC experiment showed a decrease in activation energy for tetrazole containing materials under high heating rates, further suggesting different mechanistic processes are at play.",2012
Approaching the Thermostability Limit of Nitrogen-Rich Heterocyclic Perchlorate-Based Energetic Materials,"In recent years, driven by ever-increasing application of energetic materials in deep-seated mineral resource exploitation and aerospace engineering, the mining of advanced safe energetic materials with significant thermal stability has drawn widespread publicity. Here, a tricyclic bridged energetic compound 2-amino-4,6-bis(3,5-diamino-4-nitropyrazol-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (NPX-03) was prepared using simple synthetic route. Furthermore, an interesting highly thermostable nitrogen-rich perchlorate, NPX-03 2HClO(4) , was prepared by the self-assembly reaction of NPX-03 and HClO4, displaying a thermal decomposition peak temperature of 375.9 degrees C. Moreover, NPX-03 2HClO(4) exhibits good detonation velocity (D = 8187 m s(-1)) and insensitivity (IS = 50 J, FS > 360 N), thereby being promising candidates for advanced insensitive high-energy materials.",2024
Research on Insurance Method for Energetic Materials on Information Self-Destruction Chips,"Detonation waves released by energetic materials provide an important means of physical self-destruction (Psd) for information storage chips (ISCs) in the information insurance field and offer advantages that include a rapid response and low driving energy. The high electrical sensitivity of energetic materials means that they are easily triggered by leakage currents and electrostatic forces. Therefore, a Psd module based on a graphene-based insurance actuator heterogeneously integrated with energetic materials is proposed. First, the force-balance relation between the electrostatic van der Waals force and the elastic recovery force of the insurance actuator's graphene electrode is established to realize physical isolation and an electrical interconnection between the energetic materials and the peripheral electrical systems. Second, a numerical analysis of the detonation wave stress of the energetic materials in the air domain is performed, and the copper azide dosage required to achieve reliable ISC Psd is obtained. Third, the insurance actuator is prepared via graphene thin film processing and copper azide is prepared via an in situ reaction. The experimental results show that the energetic materials proposed can release physical isolation within 14 mu s and can achieve ISC Psd under the application of a voltage signal (4.4-4.65 V). Copper azide (0.45-0.52 mg) can achieve physical damage over an ISC area (23.37-35.84 mm(2)) within an assembly gap (0.05-0.25 mm) between copper azide and ISC. The proposed method has high applicability for information insurance.",2022
Atomic perspectives revealing the evolution behavior of aluminum nanoparticles in energetic materials,"Aluminum nanoparticles (ANP) are important components of modern energetic systems because of their excellent combustion performance. However, the underlying mechanism of ANP in energetic materials during ignition is unclear. Based on the ReaxFF-lg method, the oxidation mechanism of ANP in pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) was analyzed from an atomic perspective, and the evolution of ANP from single and multi-particle models during ignition were studied. Adding ANP increases the heat release and accelerates the decomposition of PETN. ANP inhibits CO2 emissions and increases H2O yields. Both particle size and passivated layer influence the oxidation mechanisms due to different surface effects. The oxidation mechanism of smaller ANP is dominated by Al atom diffusion, but the larger ANP involves O inward diffusion and Al outward diffusion at both solid and melting states. An important behavior of chained C/Al clusters accumulation was observed during the later combustion, which agrees with the earlier experiments. The lattice diffusion aggregation of ANP and the aggregations of O/Al and C/Al cluster were revealed during the reaction. The calculated temperature distribution revealed that the hot spots in aluminized PETN originate from the oxidation heat release of ANP. This work provides an atomic perspective demonstration on the diffusion oxidation mechanism of ANP in energetic materials.",2021
Dimethoxycarbonyl Groups Surrounding a Symmetric Diaminobistetrazole Ring: Exploring New Green Energetic Materials,"A novel oxygen-containing dimethoxycarbonyl diaminobistetrazole (1) was synthesized via a facile strategy. The sodium salt (2) based on this ligand was prepared and these two compounds were fully characterized by using elemental analysis, IR and mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Their density, heats of formation, thermal stability and sensitivity, as well as the energetic properties from EXPLO5 code were investigated. These newly synthesized compounds possess high positive heats of formation and detonation heats. Compound 1 exhibits good detonation performance and acceptable stability, and might be a potential eco-friendly alternative of lead azide. The present study contributes to the development of tetrazole derivatives as new energetic materials.",2019
Assessment of dispersion correction methods within density functional theory for energetic materials,"Accurate description of the non-covalent intermolecular interaction is significant for the study of energetic materials. Here, the performance of a variety of dispersion correction methods within density functional theory (DFT) is assessed carefully for six energetic molecular crystals using experimental data as benchmark. We consider semi-empirical DFT plus dispersion correction methods (DFT-D, including DFT-D2 and DFT-D3) and non-empirical van der Waals density functional correction methods (including vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, optPBE-vdW, optB88-vdW and optB86b-vdW). The calculative cell volume, lattice energies, pressure-induced change of volume and bulk modulus are compared with the available experimental data. At ambient condition, theoretical cell volumes by optPBE-vdW, PBE-D3 and vdW-DF2 are in reasonable accordance with experimental data, while PBE-D3 and vdW-DF2 give satisfactory for lattice energies. Under high pressure, both semi-empirical PBE-D3 and non-empirical vdW-DF2 methods could yield reliable results, in which the results by PBE-D3 have smaller deviation from experiment than vdW-DF2 in the entire pressure range. Furthermore, bulk modulus by PBE-D3 calculations also compares reasonably with experimental data. These present assessments provide valuable guidelines for selecting the appropriate method to investigate physical and chemical proprieties of energetic materials in the future.",2017
Strain Rate and Microstructure Dependent Failure in HTPB/HMX Based Energetic Materials,"In this work, the mechanical properties and microstructure of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-HMX based materials are studied using experimental methods; dynamic nano impact experiment to define the viscoplastic stress-strain model and Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (MRS) to obtain Cohesive zone parameters and, Cohesive finite element method (CFEM) as numerical methods. A power law viscoplastic constitutive model was fit to the experimental data obtained in order to predict rate dependent constitutive behaviors of interfaces, particle, and matrix. These parameters are adapted, along with a viscoplastic model, to a cohesive finite element method and applied to model of different shapes of microstructure. In order to observe the effect of microstructure on the failure properties and ‘hot spot’ formation in HTPB/HMX based materials, 2 dimensional models of different microstructure shapes and densities were created using a finite element analysis code. The shapes considered were circle, diamond, a PBX undefined shape.",2017
Stabilized super-thermite colloids: A new generation of advanced highly energetic materials,"One of the great impetus of nanotechnology on energetic materials is the achievement of nanothermites (metal-oxide/metal) which are characterized by massive heat output. Yet, full exploitation of super-thermites in highly energetic systems has not been achieved. This manuscript reports on the sustainable fabrication of colloidal Fe2O3 and CuO nanoparticles for thermite applications. TEM micrographs demonstrated mono-dispersed Fe2O3 and CuO with, an average particle size of 3 and 15 nm respectively. XRD diffractograms demonstrated highly crystalline materials. SEM micrographs demonstrated a great tendency of the developed oxides to aggregate over drying process. The effective integration and dispersion of mono-dispersed colloidal thermite particles into energetic systems are vital for enhanced performance. Aluminum is of interest as highly energetic metal fuel. In this paper, synthesized Fe2O3 and CuO nanoparticles were re-dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with aluminum nanoparticles using ultrasonic prope homogenizer. The colloidal thermite peraticles can be intgegrated into highly energetic system for subsequent nanocomposite development. Thanks to stabilization of colloidal CuO nanoparticles in IPA which could offer intimate mixing between oxidizer and metal fuel. The stabilization mechanism of CuO in IPA was correlated to steric stabilization with solvent molecules. This approach eliminated nanoparticle drying and the re-dispersion of dry aggregates into energetic materials. This manuscript shaded the light on the real development of colloidal thermite mixtures and their integration into highly energetic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017
Furazan-Functionalized Tetrazolate-Based Salts: A New Family of Insensitive Energetic Materials,"Furazan-functionalized tetrazolate-based energetic salts (1-13) were prepared by direct treatment of neutral 4-amino-3-(5-tetrazole)furazan and a Lewis base or by simple metathesis reactions of its barium salt formed in situ with the corresponding Sulfate salts in aqueous solution. Key physical properties, such as melting point, thermal stability, density, hypergolicity, and sensitivity to shock, were measured. The relationship between their structures and these properties was determined. Most of salts exhibit better thermal stability than their 5-nitrotetrazolate and 5-nitraminotetrazolate analogues as well as other furazan-based salts. The structures of representative aminoguanidinium (4), carbonic hydrazylhydrazidinium (9), and 1,4-dimethyl-5-aminotetrazolium salts (13) were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Their densities, heats of formation, detonation pressures and velocities, and specific impulses were calculated. All of the salts possess high positive heats of formation. The effect of the furazan ring on these physicochemical properties was examined and discussed.",2009
Raman spectroscopy as a tool for long-term energetic material stability studies,"Raman spectroscopy is shown to be useful as a tool for long-term stability studies. The stability of a novel submicron-size gamma-polymorph form of the explosive HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) was monitored up to 1 year using Raman spectroscopy. The preparation and characterization of this submicron HMX has been previously discussed. It is important to know the long-term stability of this submicron gamma-polymorph material under ambient conditions for its eventual utilization. This submicron HMX material has been found to be stable both chemically and polymorphically (to the order of 1% impurity level), even though HMX normally converts to the beta-polymorph at ambient conditions.

Dynamics simulation and product quality consistency optimization of energetic material extrusion process,"This study addresses the issue of quality consistency in the extrusion process of energetic materials using multi-channel dies. To improve the extrusion efficiency of single-base energetic materials, a multi-channel die approach is utilized to yield more products in one extrusion. However, this method may compromise quality consistency during the process. Consequently, the finite element method (FEM) was employed for dynamics simulation of the extrusion process in the multi-channel die and further analysed the impact of critical parameters, such as extrusion speed and channel position, on product quality consistency. A strong linear relationship between flow parameters and dc\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${d}_{c}$$\end{document}, the average distance from each channel to the center of the die outlet plane, was reveal from simulation results. An optimization method based on channel distribution was proposed, and the product quality consistency ratio was calculated by averaging the shape consistency ratio, surface quality consistency ratio, and density consistency ratio. Simulation results indicate that this method effectively improves product quality consistency without significantly compromising extrusion efficiency. However, while increasing piston speed can also enhance product quality consistency, it will raise the extrusion pressure, thus increasing the risk of energetic material burning. Overall, this research provides new theoretical underpinnings and practical methods for optimizing the extrusion process of energetic materials. The basic theory, formula, algorithm, and simulation will be presented to validate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.",2024
Electrophoretic Deposition of Al/CuO Energetic Materials and Their Heat Release Performance,"In this study, Al/CuO energetic materials with high exothermic properties were prepared by electrophoretic deposition of nano-Al and CuO microboxes on Ti sheets. The microstructure and phase composition of Al/CuO energetic materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrophoretic deposition behavior of nano-Al and CuO microboxes were systematically investigated, and the electrophoretic deposition process was controlled by diffusion. The differential scanning calorimetry results showed that the maximum heat released by Al/CuO energetic material is 3049 J/g at an equivalent ratio of 3.0. The combustion properties of Al/CuO energetic materials were tested by optical fiber spectra. When the equivalence ratio was 2.25, the intensity of the spectra of Al/CuO energetic materials were the strongest and the lowest color temperature was 2916 K. This work provides a reference for the preparation of highly exothermic Al/CuO energetic materials by electrophoretic deposition.",2020
Boosting Performance and Safety of Energetic Materials by Polymorphic Transition,"An increasing attention has been witnessed to the field of crystal engineering of energetic materials very recently. This study revealed the synthesis, structure, and energetic properties of 4,6-dinitro-1-(4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-2-yl)-1H-indazole (3) with two polymorphic forms, alpha-3 and beta-3. The 4,6-dinitro-indazole derivative alpha-3 with a wave-like stacking structure was synthesized by one-step reaction at room temperature. Interestingly, the beta-3 could be formed at 78 degrees C. It is noteworthy that plate-shaped alpha-3 crystals could transform to beta-3 with needle-shaped crystals. The single-crystal diffraction data revealed that beta-3 is nearly coplanar and features closer layer-by-layer package structure, thereby exhibiting increases of 0.08 g cm(-3) (4.7%), 36.6 kJ mo1(-1) (6.1%), 667 m s(-1) (9%), 3.4 GPa (15.5%), 88 degrees C (49%), 6 J (23%), and 97 N (43%) in density, heat of formation (Delta H), detonation velocity (D) and pressure (P), decomposition temperature (T-dec), impact sensitivity (IS), and friction sensitivity (FS) compared to alpha-3, respectively. Compared to TNT, the beta-3 (D = 8061 m s(-1), P = 25.4 GPa, IS = 32 J, FS = 320 N) possesses better detonation properties and sensitivities. Based on experimental results and theoretical analysis, this study provides an effective strategy for improving the performance of energetic materials in molecular design and crystal configuration.",2019
Combustion and Material Characterization of Highly Tunable On-Chip Energetic Porous Silicon,"We present a comprehensive investigation into the tunable combustion of on-chip porous silicon energetic materials. The exothermic reaction occurs between high surface area nanoscale porous silicon and a solution-deposited sodium perchlorate oxidizer that penetrates each pore. The resulting burn rates spanned three orders of magnitude, from 5.2 to 1950ms(-1). Material properties of the porous silicon films were characterized using gas adsorption porosimetry, SEM, and profilometry, over specific surface areas between 191 and 901m(2)g(-1), and porosities between 49 and 80%. Combustion events were characterized using high speed imaging and bomb calorimetry. Results revealed that combustion depended on several material properties including surface area and porosity of the porous silicon substrate, with the peak flame speed occurring at 895m(2)g(-1) specific surface area, 3.32nm pore size, and 72% porosity. Measured heat of combustion increased with porosity over the range of 65-75%, up to 22.5kJg(-1) of porous silicon at 75% porosity. These measurements along with gravimetric determinations of oxidizer pore loading suggest that the system was typically fuel rich, with macroscopic morphology and porous silicon film mechanical integrity generally limiting the realistic range of porosity values to less than stoichiometric conditions.",2015
Decomposition of nitramine energetic materials in excited electronic states: RDX and HMX.,"Ultraviolet excitation (8-ns duration) is employed to study the decomposition of RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane) and HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane) from their first excited electronic states. Isolated RDX and HMX are generated in the gas phase utilizing a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption and supersonic jet expansion techniques. The NO molecule is observed as one of the initial dissociation products by both time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Four different vibronic transitions of NO are observed: A (2)Sigma(v(') = 0)<--X (2)Pi(v("") = 0,1,2,3). Simulations of the NO rovibronic intensities for the A<--X transitions show that dissociated NO from RDX and HMX is rotationally cold (approximately 20 K) and vibrationally hot (approximately 1800 K). Another potential initial product of RDX and HMX excited state dissociation could be OH, generated along with NO, perhaps from a HONO intermediate species. The OH radical is not observed in fluorescence even though its transition intensity is calculated to be 1.5 times that found for NO per radical generated. The HONO intermediate is thereby found not to be an important pathway for the excited electronic state decomposition of these cyclic nitramines.",n-22
Thermal chemistry and decomposition behaviors of energetic materials with trimerizing furoxan skeleton,"Trimerizing furoxans are ideal molecular skeletons for the construction of high energetic substances due to their compact structures and high enthalpy of formations. To explore and compare the thermal behaviors of energetic materials with tandem trimerizing furoxan molecular skeleton, we reported the first systematic research on the thermochemical behaviors and decomposition mechanism of 3,4-bis(3-fluorodinitromethylfuroxan-4-yl)furoxan (BFTF), 3,4-bis(3-cyanofurazan)furazan oxide (BCTFO) and benzotrifuroxan (BTF). According to the research results of the DSC-TG experiments, both the substituted furoxan based energetic compounds (BCTFO and BFTF) exhibited low melting points and complicated thermal decomposition behaviors around 240 degrees C, while the melting point of unsubstituted furoxan (BTF) was much higher. Their detailed decomposition mechanisms were proposed based on the experimental results through tandem techniques including in-situ FTIR spectroscopy method and DSC-TG-FTIR-MS quadruple technology, which indicated that the cleavage of substituent would trigger the decompositions of BFTF and the decomposition of trimerizing furoxan skeletons almost synchronous occurrence with substituents in BCTFO. The self-oxidation-reduction of the linear and annular trimerizing furoxans lead to similar decomposition fragmented small molecule products. image",2024
High-pressure and temperature neural network reactive force field for energetic materials,"Reactive force fields for molecular dynamics have enabled a wide range of studies in numerous material classes. These force fields are computationally inexpensive compared with electronic structure calculations and allow for simulations of millions of atoms. However, the accuracy of traditional force fields is limited by their functional forms, preventing continual refinement and improvement. Therefore, we develop a neural network-based reactive interatomic potential for the prediction of the mechanical, thermal, and chemical responses of energetic materials at extreme conditions. The training set is expanded in an automatic iterative approach and consists of various CHNO materials and their reactions under ambient and shock-loading conditions. This new potential shows improved accuracy over the current state-of-the-art force fields for a wide range of properties such as detonation performance, decomposition product formation, and vibrational spectra under ambient and shock-loading conditions.",2023
Characterization of Ta-Ni-Al energetic structural material fabricated by explosive consolidation,"Multi-element intermetallic energetic structural materials (ESMs) can be applied as reactive fragment, reactive shell and reactive shaped charge. As typical of intermetallics ESMs, Ni-Al ESMs have been heavily studied. However, the low density limits its application. This work proposed to improve the performance of Ni-Al ESMs by adding Ta. The nearly fully dense Ta-Ni-Al ESMs with a molar ratio 4:3:3 was successfully fabricated by explosive consolidation. The density was high up to 10.52 g/cm(3) (98.3% theoretical maximum density). The heat treatment was used to further improve the performance of the Ta-Ni-Al ESMs. The microstructure characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and trans-mission electron microscope. The mechanical properties, reaction and impact-induced energy release have been systematically studied. Firstly, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were conducted to analyze the mechanical properties of the sample before and after heat treatment. Secondly, the reaction characteristics in different atmospheres were discussed by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of the additive Ta was concerned. Furthermore, Impact-induced energy release tests on the Ta-Ni-Al ESMs were performed to understand the energy release properties. Based on these tests, the characterization of Ta-Ni-Al ESMs fabricated by explosive consolidation was obtained. There was no intermetallic formed in explosive consolidated samples. After the heat treatment, Ta-Ni-Al ESMs have good plasticity and strain rate effect. Meanwhile, under high impact velocity, the impact-induced energy release capability of Ta-Ni-Al ESMs was equivalent to Ni-Al ESMs. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2022
Substituted triazolo-triazine derivatives as energetic materials: a computational investigation and assessment,"A series of energetic compounds were derived from [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazine and azo-bridged fused backbone by introducing the -NO2, -NHNO2, -ONO2, -N-3, and -NH(2)explosophoric groups. The influence of explosophoric groups on energetic properties has been explored. All the compounds exhibit positive energy content (34.4-1955.4 kJ/mol) and densities (1.71-1.99 g/cm(3)) subject to fused triazole and triazine framework and various functional groups. The designed compounds with -NHNO2, -ONO2, and -NO(2)functional groups possess high detonation velocities (8.23-9.00 km/s), pressures (30.94-37.68 GPa), Gurney velocities (2.70-2.88 km/s), and power index (109-131%) superior to TNT (6.94 m/s, 22.0 GPa, 2.37 km/s, and 118%) and comparable with RDX (8.60 km/s, 33.92 GPa, 2.93 km/s, and 169%) and HMX (8.90 km/s, 38.39 GPa, 2.97 km/s, and 169%). Based on high nitrogen and energy content, performance parameters, and sensitivity data, the designed compounds show high potential to be used as energetic materials.",2020
Conjugation in multi-tetrazole derivatives: a new design direction for energetic materials,"Multi-tetrazole derivatives with conjugated structures were designed and investigated in this study. Using quantum chemistry methods, the crystal structures, electrostatic potentials (ESPs), multicenter bond orders, HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and detonation properties of the derivatives were calculated. As expected, these molecules with conjugated structures showed low energies of their crystal structures, molecular layering in their crystals, high average ESPs, high multicenter bond order values, and enhanced detonation properties. The derivative 1,2-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)diazene (N2) was predicted to have the best density (1.87 g/cm(3)), detonation velocity (9006 m/s), and detonation pressure (36.8 GPa) of the designed molecules, while its total crystal energy was low, suggesting that it is relatively stable. Its sensitivity was also low, as the molecular stacking that occurs in its crystal allows external forces to be dissipated into movements of crystal layers. Finally, its multicenter bond order was high, indicating a highly conjugated structure.",2018
From laminar to turbulent detonations in energetic materials from molecular dynamics simulations,The structure of a self-sustained detonation wave in solid energetic materials was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Energetic materials are described by the AB model with parameters modified to investigate the detonation-wave structures. It is found that depending on the reaction barrier for the exothermic reactions driving the detonation and the boundary conditions of the sample this simple model exhibits a detonation structure that can range from a planar to a complex turbulent detonation. The different regimes of condensed-phase detonation seen are similar to those observed in gases and diluted liquids.,2014
"Synthesis, Crystal Structure and DFT Calculation of Energetic Material: Ethylenediamine Diperchlorate (YE)","A novel inorganic high explosive Ethylenediamine Diperchlorate (YE) is synthesized.

A modular “ionic liquid” platform for the custom design of energetic materials,"In their first ""evolution"" ionic liquids (ILs) were mostly investigated and developed for their unique physical properties as solvents. In the second ""evolution"" it has been realized that the independent tunability of the cation and anion offers almost unlimited access to targeted combinations of not only physical properties, but also chemical properties. Thus, due to the structural composition of the ILs they form a unique architectural platform on which, at least potentially, the properties of cationic and/or anionic components can be independently modified. This allows for tunability in the design of new functional materials, while retaining the core features of the IL behavior. This approach is demonstrated here in the field of energetic ionic liquids (EILs), which utilize this design flexibility to find new energetic materials incorporating typical IL behavior, and at the same time, energetic material properties. New compounds were synthesized and investigated in order to develop an understanding of the criteria needed for the future modeling and prediction of fundamental properties to produce IL materials, incorporating both the required energetic and complementary properties essential for this class of compounds. Synthetic efforts were not directed to the preparation of energetic fluids, but rather to synthesize new materials (in particular incorporating energetic functionalities) that will enable a link between chemical characteristics and the desired physical and thermodynamic properties. In completing the goals of the presented research it was hoped that gaining a fundamental understanding of model compounds will provide the information base for a relevant future design of energetic ionic liquids. The applied modular approach presented allowed the development of the presented research on EILs in three different areas, trying to address major issues that may be confronted in the future while designing new EIL materials. The main focus has been placed on (i) the design, synthesis, screening, and evaluation of new IL components, energetically substituted imidazolium cations and azolate anions, to create an IL toolbar that can be later used to suggest methods to prepare new or improved EIL materials, (ii) the development of new synthetic protocols for the formation of EIL materials that can also be easily translated to the syntheses of other classes of ILs, and (iii) the multicomponent approach to improve the properties of model compounds that can be easily applied when ""pure"" two-component salts are not required for a given application.",2007
Chemical and energetic control of phase stability in silica/surfactant composite materials,"Self-organized silica/surfactant composite materials provide a unique method to produce an inorganic framework with tunable nanoscale architecture through inorganic/organic co-assembly. These composite materials show well-devolved nanoscale periodicity in the range of 10–200 Å and may be used to produce a porous inorganic with a narrow pore size distribution by removal of the organic component. This thesis addresses issues of structural stability in inorganic/organic composite materials. All silica/surfactant composites are kinetically trapped structures, thus to better understand metastability in these materials it is necessary to understand how structures can form and rearrange on the nanometer length scale. This is investigated by following the kinetics of a hexagonal-to-lamellar phase transformation that occurs under hydrothermal conditions. To understand the kinetic data, we must explore how structural changes on the nanometer length scale are coupled to silica bonding changes that occur on the atomic length scale. Changes in the bonding of the inorganic framework (which can be simply controlled through pH) help reveal the molecular basis for kinetic barriers. We show that the most important factor in increasing nanoscale phase stability is the regularity of the inorganic framework. In addition, we discover that pre-transformation chemical and thermal treatments, which change the inorganic framework, can be used to inhibit a phase transformation. We also follow changes in the organic packing with temperature to better understand the driving force for structural rearrangement in these inorganic/organic composite materials. Heating surfactant results in an increase of surfactant tail volume, which also decreases organic domain curvature. However, a decrease in micelle curvature, rather than an increase in volume, is necessary to drive phase transformations in these composites. Lastly, hydrothermal differential scanning calorimetry is performed to learn about the energetics rather than the kinetics of rearrangement. We find that restructuring of the nanoscale periodicity is the dominant energetic process during a phase transition while atomic scale silica chemistry (hydrolysis and condensation) is dominant at all other times.",2002
Study on Shock Initiation Randomness of Energetic Materials on a Macroscopic Scale,"The shock initiation randomness problem of energetic materials (SIREM) is an important problem in the research field of energetic material safety. With the purposes of solving SIREM on a macroscopic scale and obtaining the statistics, such as the initiation probabilities of energetic materials and the statistical characteristics of the detonation pressure, this paper considers the effect of the randomness of the parameters of the Lee-Tarver equation of reaction rate and the JWL equation of state of energetic materials and the randomness of load intensity parameters-such as fragment shock velocity-on the randomness of the shock initiations of energetic materials. It then decomposes SIREM into an initiation probability problem (IP) and a detonation pressure randomness problem (DPR). Further, with the Back Propagation Neural Networks optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GABPNN) as the surrogate models of the numerical models of two-phase reactive flow, this paper proposes the approach of solving IP and DPR in turn, adopting Monte Carlo Simulations, which use the calculations of GABPNNs as repeated sampling tests (GABP-MCSs). Finally, by taking the shock initiation randomness problem of Composition B as an applied example, this paper adopts GABP-MCS under the randomness conditions that the means of fragment shock velocities are 1050 m/s and 1000 m/s and that the coefficients of variation (CVs) of BRVs are 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 in order to obtain the initiation probabilities of Composition B and the statistical characteristics, such as the means and CVs of the detonation pressure. It further observes the variation tendencies that these statistics show under various randomness conditions, so as to prove the effectiveness of GABP-MCS in solving SIREM. Therefore, this paper investigates SIREM on a macroscopic scale and proposes a universal technique for solving SIREM by GABP-MCS, in the hope of shedding some light on the SIREM study.",2023
Analysis on shock attenuation in gap test configuration for characterizing energetic materials,"A pyrotechnic system consisting of donor/acceptor pair separated by a gap relies on shock attenuation characteristics of the gap material and shock sensitivity of the donor and the acceptor charges. Despite of its common use, a numerical study of such a pyrotechnic train configuration is seldom reported because proper modeling of the full process requires precise capturing of the shock wave attenuation in the gap prior to triggering a full detonation of a high explosive and accurate description of the high strain rate dynamics of the explosively loaded inert confinements. We apply a hybrid particle level-set based multimaterial hydrocode with reactive flow models for pentolite donor and heavily aluminized cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine as the acceptor charge. The complex shock interaction, a critical gap thickness, an acoustic impedance, and go/no-go characteristics of the pyrotechnic system are quantitatively investigated. (C) 2016 Author(s).",2016
Energetic Material Synthesis: Scale-up Using a Novel Modular Microflow Reactor Setup,"The advantages ofmicroflow reactors have proven to be manifold,e.g., the excellent cooling ability, which allows performing exothermicreactions like nitrations safely. A critical point remains the transitionfrom gram scale to industrial production. On an industrial scale,they are often designed for specific syntheses and are therefore lessuseful for a conventional research laboratory. A reactor setup wassuccessfully developed mitigating these shortcomings and allowingthe use of highly corrosive materials, like fuming inorganic acids(e.g., nitric, sulfuric acid), bases (e.g., bleach solutions), andchlorinated solvents. As a proof of functionality, the synthesis ofnitroguanidine has been performed on a lab scale and was significantlyimproved over reported batch syntheses in terms of safety and productionrate. A scale-up to industrial scale has hence become feasible.",2023

One-step preparation of graphene nanosheets via deflagration of obsoleted energetic materials,"Herein, we report the large-scale preparation of graphene nanosheets via the deflagration of an obsoleted single base propellant in the presence of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) aiming at decreasing the oxygen balance. The high ambient pressure and high temperature generated during the deflagration process provided sufficient conditions for the efficient formation of carbon atoms and the subsequent shaping of graphene nanosheets. The prepared graphene nanosheets were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). This simple method is promising for future large-scale and cost-effective production of graphene nanosheets, as well as for the disposal of obsoleted energetic materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

EXPLOSIVE COMPATIONS OF INTERMETALLIC-FORMING POWDER MIXTURES FOR FABRICATING STRUCTURAL ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"A double-tube implosion geometry is used to explosively shock consolidate intermetallic-forming Ni-Al, Ta-Al, Nb-Al, Mo-Al and W-Al powder mixtures for fabricating bulk structural energetic materials, with mechanical strength and ability to undergo impact-initiated exothermic reactions. The compacts are characterized based on uniformity of microstructure and degree of densification. Mechanical properties of the compacts are characterized over the strain-rate range of 10(-3) to 10(4) s(-1). The impact reactivity is determined using rod-on-anvil experiments, in which disk-shaped compacts mounted on a copper projectile, are impacted against a steel anvil in using a 7.62 mm gas gun. The impact reactivity of the various explosively-consolidated reactive powder mixture compacts is correlated with overall kinetic energy and impact stress to determine their influence on threshold for reaction initiation. The characteristics of the various compacts, their mechanical properties and impact-initiated chemical reactivity will be described in this paper.",2009
Shock sensitivity of energetic material and nanometric damage mechanisms in silica glass,"This dissertation focuses on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of shock sensitivity of energetic material (EM) and nanometric damage mechanisms in amorphous SiO 2 (a-SiO 2 ). A scalable parallel MD algorithm incorporating first principles-based reactive force fields (ReaxFF) has been implemented to perform multimillion-to-billion atom chemically reactive MD simulations. Mechanical stimuli in energetic materials initiate chemical reactions at shock fronts prior to detonation. Multimillion-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations are performed to investigate atomistic mechanisms of shock-induced reaction initiation in 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) crystal. The simulation reveals a bi-modal molecular response against a planar shock loading, which creates a nanoscale layered-structure of molecular dipole behind a shock front. The sensitivity of energetic crystals changes with defects such as voids, grain boundaries and cracks. By performing million-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations, the effects of microstructures in crystal on shock sensitivity have been investigated. MD simulation reveals the formation of a nanojet which focuses into a narrow beam as the void collapses. By increasing particle velocity, a pinning-depinning transition of the shock wave front at the void occurs. Shock loading simulation in a nanophase RDX crystal reveals a deformation mechanism that is mediated by molecular reorientation and conformation changes. Molecular rotation and deformation significantly reduce the energy barrier for the onset of slip. In contrast to crystalline solids, damage, flow and fracture in glass are still controversial areas. We have performed multimillion-atom MD simulations to investigate initiation and growth of wing cracks in confined silica glass. Under dynamic compression, frictional sliding of precrack surfaces nucleates nanovoids which evolve into nanocrack columns at the precrack tip. Nanocrack columns merge to form a wing crack, which grows via coalescence with nanovoids in the direction of maximum compression. Multimillion-to-billion-atom MD simulations are performed on nanovoid array under hydrostatic tension. Nanocavities nucleate in intervoid ligaments as a result of the expansion of Si-O rings due to a bond-switching mechanism, which involves bond breaking between Si-O and bond formation between that Si and a nonbridging O. With further increase in strain, nanocracks form on void surfaces and ligaments fracture through the growth and coalescence of ligament nanocavities.",2008
Preparation and performance optimization of core@double-shell structured energetic composite materials,"A suitable binder system is critical to ensure the energy properties, safety properties, formability, and mechanical properties of an energetic composite material (ECM). The energetic ionic salt, 5,5 '-bistetrazole-1,1 '-diolate (TKX50), has attracted extensive attentions due to its low sensitivity and high energy properties. Its composition with the high energy explosive 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) can construct ECMs with high energies and low sensitivities. However, the poor interfacial adhesions between TKX-50 and conventional binders greatly limit its application to such purpose. In this work, the interaction forces between cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and its anion derivative, carboxymethyl cellulose acetate butyrate (CMCAB), and two explosives, TKX-50 and HMX, were compared by using the molecular dynamics (MD) software. The effects of the binder systems including CAB, CMCAB and CMCAB@CAB on the bonding and coating of the mixtures of TKX-50 and HMX were compared by SEM and binder component analysis. And then CMCAB@CAB was selected to prepare a series of core-double-shell ECMs at different TKX-50:HMX mass ratios. The effects of the binder systems and TKX-50 content on the morphology and mechanical sensitivity of the ECMs were evaluated using a SEM and sensitivity apparatuses. The thermal conductivities (lambda) and specific heat capacities (Cp) of the ECMs were determined using a thermal conductivity meter and DSC, respectively. The thermal decomposition properties of ECMs in open and adiabatic environments were characterized by a DSC and accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC), respectively, and the thermal decomposition mechanism was discussed. It is revealed that the good coating effects of CMCAB@CAB on TKX-50/HMX mixture enable the good formability of ECMs. The obtained ECMs show excellent mechanical sensitivities and thermal safety. Our work has provided a new approaching to the application of TKX-50 and the preparation of new high-energy and insensitive energetic composites.",2024
Supercritical carbon dioxide assisted formation of crystalline materials for various energetic applications,"In this highlight article, supercritical carbon dioxide-based strategies for ""green"" preparation of uniform fine particles (crystals) of advanced functional materials for energy production and storage are briefly overviewed. In particular, the CO2-facilitated processes for obtaining high-performance cathode or anode materials for rechargeable lithium, sodium, or potassium ion batteries, advanced electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells, and prospective energetic materials which accumulate energy in the form of high-energy chemical bonds are summarized with a focus on original reports published over the past decade.

Carbon skeleton: route to investigate high-performance insensitive energetic materials,"Over the past century, the search for high-performance insensitive energetic materials (HIEMs) has been a highly challenging task in the field of energetic materials. Herein, based on a five-membered carbon skeleton, a new structural framework, 4-amino-3,5-dinitrocyclopentane-1,2-dione, was synthesized through an interesting ring contraction reaction. Its derivatives (3-8) meet nearly all of the significant criteria of HIEMs for commercial applications: high density, good denotation performance, simple synthetic routes, low production costs, mild preparation conditions, and simple post-processing. Both excellent physiochemical properties and facile synthesis indicate the great application potential of this new carbon skeleton and its derivatives in the field of energetic materials.",2022
Exploring the Relationships Between Fuel and Oxidizer Reaction of Biocidal Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials are defined as a class of material with extremely high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released when ignited, along with intensive light emission and shock generation. Developing new energetic materials with high efficiency neutralization of biological warfare agents has gained increased attention due to the increased threat of bioterrorism. The objective of this dissertation is to develop new energetic materials with biocidal capabilities and apply them in various nanothermite systems to explore the relationships between fuel and oxidizer reactions. Aerosol techniques offer a convenient route and potentially direct route for preparation of small particles with high purity, and is a method proven to be amenable and economical to scale-up. Here I demonstrate the synthesis of various iodine oxides/iodic acids microparticles by a direct one-step aerosol method from iodic acid. A previously misidentified phase of I 4 O 9 hydrate is in fact a new polymorph of HIO 3 which crystalizes in the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . Various iodine oxides/iodic acids, including I 2 O 5 , HI 3 O 8 and HIO 3 , were employed as oxidizers in thermite systems. Their decomposition behaviors were studied using a home-made time resolved temperature-jump/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (T-Jump/TOFMS). In addition, nano-aluminum (nAl), nano-tantalum and carbon black were adopted as the fuel or additive in order to fully understand how iodine containing oxidizers react with the fuel during ignition. The ignition and reaction process of those thermites were characterized with T-Jump/TOFMS. Carbon black was found to be able to lower both initiation and iodine release temperatures compared to those of Al/iodine oxides and Ta/iodine oxides thermites. Their combustion properties were evaluated in a constant-volume combustion cell and results show that nAl/a-HI 3 O 8 has the highest pressurization rate and peak pressure and shortest burn time. However, an ignition delay was always present in their pressure profiles while combusting. To shorten or eliminate this ignition delay, a secondary oxidizer CuO is incorporated into Al/I 2 O 5 system and four different Al/I 2 O 5 /CuO thermites by varying the mass ratio between two oxidizers are prepared and studied in a constant volume combustion cell. Significant enhancement is observed for all four thermites and their peak pressures and pressurization rates are much higher than that of Al/I 2 O 5 or Al/CuO. Two other oxidizers also demonstrate similar effects as to CuO on promoting the combustion performance of Al/I 2 O 5 . A novel oxidizer AgFeO 2 particles was prepared via a wet-chemistry method and evaluated as an oxidizer in aluminum-based thermite system. Its structure, morphologies and thermal behavior were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, TGA/DSC, and T-Jump/TOFMS. The results indicate the decomposition pathways of AgFeO 2 vary with heating rates from a two-step at low heating rate to a single step at high heating rate. Ignition of Al/AgFeO 2 at a temperature just above the oxygen release temperature and is very similar to Al/CuO. However, with a pressurization rate three times of Al/CuO, Al/AgFeO 2 yields a comparable result to Al/hollow-CuO or Al/KClO 4 /CuO, with a simpler preparation method. T-Jump/TOFMS was used to study the ignition and decomposition of boron-based thermites. The ignition behaviors of bare boron nanopowders and boron-based nanothermites at various gaseous oxygen pressure were investigated using the T-Jump method. High-heating rate transmission electron microscopy studies were performed on both B/CuO and B/Bi 2 O 3 nanothermites to evaluate the ignition process. I propose a co-sintering effect between B 2 O 3 and the oxidizer play an important role in the ignition process of boron-based nanothermites.",2019
"Tetracyclic pyrazine-fused furazans as insensitive energetic materials: syntheses, structures, and properties","Energetic compounds with fused tetracyclic backbones were synthesized and fully characterized, and their structures were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Changes from nonplanar to planar structures led their densities to increase from 1.800 to 1.856 g cm(-3) (298 K). Hydrogen bonds and - interactions were analyzed to understand this phenomenon. Energetic evaluations showed that compounds 2 and 3 detonated with performance comparable to TATB. Excellent mechanical sensitivities (IS: >40 J; FS: >360 N) indicate the promise of these furazans as insensitive energetic materials.",2018
"Long-Wave, Infrared Laser-Induced Breakdown (LIBS) Spectroscopy Emissions from Energetic Materials","Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has shown great promise for applications in chemical, biological, and explosives sensing and has significant potential for real-time standoff detection and analysis. In this study, LIBS emissions were obtained in the mid-infrared (MIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral regions for potential applications in explosive material sensing. The IR spectroscopy region revealed vibrational and rotational signatures of functional groups in molecules and fragments thereof. The silicon-based detector for conventional ultraviolet-visible LIBS operations was replaced with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector for MIR-LWIR spectral detection. The IR spectral signature region between 4 and 12 gm was mined for the appearance of MIR and LWIR-LIBS emissions directly indicative of oxygenated breakdown products as well as dissociated, and/or recombined sample molecular fragments. Distinct LWIR-LIBS emission signatures from dissociated-recombination sample molecular fragments between 4 and 12 mu m are observed for the first time.",2012
Use of condensed-phase reaction models in combustion simulation of energetic materials,"The contribution of condensed-phase reaction kinetics to the overall combustion behavior of cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine is investigated in the context of a successful two-step chemical reaction scheme introduced by Ward, Son, and Brewster (""Role of Gas- and Condensed-Phase Kinetics in Burning Rate Control of Energetic Solids,"" Combustion Theory and Modelling, Vol. 2, No. 3,1998, pp. 293-312; also ""Steady Deflagration of HMX with Simple Kinetics: A Gas Phase Chain Reaction Model,"" Combustion and Flame, Vol. 114, Nos. 3-4, 1998, pp. 556-568). We derive extensions of the activation energy asymptotics of the condensed-phase reaction from nth-order (0 <= n <= 1) kinetics to include 10 additional analytic reaction models. The results show that it is not possible to determine uniquely the condensed-phase reaction model by validating against steady-state burn rates and surface temperatures because the parameters of all models are sufficiently flexible to fit the experiments. However, the frequency-dependent transient response functions of mass burning rate to fluctuations in pressure and external radiation are somewhat more sensitive to the choice of kinetic model. The sensitivity of using different kinetic models to fit experimental T-burner data is more pronounced under conditions in which the surface temperature is low and no external radiation is applied. The power law model, which has the highest contribution to condensed-phase heat release, provides the best fit to transient combustion response functions.",2008
Dynamic mesoscale cracking modeling of energetic composite materials in Hopkinson bar test,"Dynamic cracking behavior of energetic composite materials (ECMs) is very difficult to be modelled due to the complex microcrack evolution. The microcrack evolution in highly particle-filled composite materials presents asymmetrical characteristics under tension-compression. In this paper, a dynamic mesoscale viscoelastic model taking into account the micmcrack growth is developed to simulate the center splitting phenomenon of the Octahydro-1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-Tetrazocine-based ECM Brazilian disc under dynamic loadings by means of the Hopkinson bar test. The microcrack evolution modeling fully considers cracking nucleation, growth and coalescence. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to drive the crack propagation. The dynamic cracking formation in the test is captured well. The details of the cracking are analyzed for different loading conditions. The cracking initiation orientation is modelled with different precrack conditions. In addition, the effect of the failure criterion on the dynamic cracking condition is determined. Further, the heterogeneous failure surfaces are considered and compared with the unique failure surface condition.",2022
Synthesis and fluorescence sensing of energetic materials using benzenesulfonic acid-doped polyaniline,"The Fluorescence sensing technique for trace detection of High Energy Materials (HEMs) has gained more attention in recent times. In the present paper, the interaction between the fluorophore and HEMs is studied using spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The fluorophore polyaniline (PANI) was functionalised by doping it with benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) to increase the processability, and mobility of pi-electrons along with decreased p-stacking. It is observed that upon doping the solubility of BSA-PANI is increased, facilitating a higher quenching by commercial explosives, i.e., RDX, CL-20, CL-20:RDX cocrystal. The interaction studies undertaken though fluorescence quenching, FTIR and Resonance Raman studies shows that the benzenoid unit, polaron and bipolaron nitrogen in BSA-PANI interact with nitro groups of HEMs and form a charge-transfer complex between HEMs and BSA-PANI undergoing predominantly a PET mechanism. LOD value is found to be least for Cocrystal (1.876 9 10(-5) M) when compared to other HEMs 3.191 9 10(-5) M (CL-20), 5.904 9 10(-5) M (RDX), 3.734 9 10(-5) M (PETN) indicating that cocrystal can be detected in trace level. The collaborative study between cyclic voltammetry and the observed results of fluorescence quenching, revealed that the emeraldine salt form of (BSA-PANI) is sensitive to HEMs.",2022
The Internal Charge Evolution of Multilayered Materials Undergoing Mono-Energetic Electron Bombardment,"The charging of multilayer materials as related to the charging of spacecraft is one of the primary concerns related to activities in the space environment. To understand how multilayer materials undergoing electron bombardment charge, an in-depth study of energy-dependent material properties must be undertaken. These properties include the electron penetration depth, secondary electron emission, charge transport and electrostatic discharge. By using energy dependent models of these properties, along with the geometry of the system, multilayer models can be developed to predict the time evolution of the internal charge distribution. Using these models, the net surface potential and the measurement of electrode currents can be used to extrapolate information about the internal charge distribution. The Utah State University Materials Physics Group, with the funding of NASA James Webb Space Telescope project, performed several tests to understand the charging of multilayer dielectrics in various configurations. By using the Surface Voltage Probe to measure the net surface potential, along with measured electrode currents, the internal charge distribution can be inferred by using the developed theory for multilayer materials. Because each scenario requires a unique analysis, the theory of multilayer charging for a multilayer dielectric is outlined for four configurations defined as (i) surface layer deposition with grounded conductive layer, (ii) surface deposition with ungrounded conductive layer, (iii) conductive layer deposition with grounded conductive layer, and (iv) conductive layer deposition with ungrounded conductive layer. The results for these tests are outlined along with the fits given by the predictive models. The results of the tests show that knowledge of the energy-dependent electronic properties of the material, the energy of the incident electrons and the geometry of the system are all vital to predict the outcome of the given scenario. It is shown that for multilayer materials with an ungrounded conductive layer, electrostatic discharge occurs after the material charges past the breakdown limits of the material. These results can help to design, construct, and model already deployed spacecraft to mitigate and prevent detrimental spacecraft charging effects.",2021
Investigation of Different Nano Scale Energetic Material Systems for Reactive Wafer Bonding,"This paper introduces a method that uses a specific form of local heat generation, which is based on nano scale reactive multilayer systems.

Synthesis mechanism of four metallic Cyclo-N,"In the past five years, over 20 types of cyclo-N-5(-) energetic materials (EMs) have been successfully synthesized. Metallic cyclo-N-5(-) EMs exhibit higher density and performance compared to non-metallic cyclo-N-5(-) EMs. However, the mechanisms for such metallic cyclo-N-5(-) EMs remain unexplored. Herein, we performed a thorough quantum chemistry study on the mechanistic pathway for the cyclo-N-5(- ) trapped by metal cations in four cyclo-N5- EMs: [Na(H2O) (N-5)] center dot 2H(2)O, [M(H2O)4(N-5)2] center dot 4H(2)O (M = Mn, Fe, and Co), by density functional theory methods and transition state theory. During the synthesis process, the cyclo-N-5(- ) in the precursor hybrid aromatic compound is susceptible to electrophilic attack by metal cations. This attack disrupts the hydrogen bond interaction surrounding the cyclo-N-5(- ), ultimately leading to the formation of either an ionic bond or a coordination bond between the metal cation and the cyclo-N-5(- ), resulting in an electrophilic substitution reaction. In addition, solvent effects reduce the energy of the ionic bond, thereby promoting the reaction. Our findings will provide valuable insights for future route design and contribute to enhancing the synthesis yield of cyclo-N-5(- ) EMs in both theoretical and experimental aspects.",2023
Dynamic fracture and frictional heating due to periodic excitation in energetic materials,"Mechanical stimulus may lead to localized temperature increase due to the concentration of energy dissipation at microstructural features. Mechanically induced heating occurs, for example, when materials are subjected to periodic excitation. This is a particular concern in energetic materials where ignition may start a deflagration. In this study, finite element simulations are performed on a single beta-HMX particle in a polymer matrix subjected to mechanical periodic excitation. Different initial defects, such as cracks and interface debonding, are included to control the location of hot-spots nucleation. The model accounts for damage evolution and heat generation due to friction at cracks. The results indicate that hot-spots nucleate preferentially at the particle/binder interface, and therefore, the temperature rate is higher when the particle is initially debonded than when it is perfectly attached to the polymer.

Reactive molecular dynamics study of thermal decomposition of nanocarbon energetic composite materials,"Graphene-base material is a potential candidate of nano-additives for improving the performance of energetic materials. We employed ReaxFF-Ig reactive molecular dynamics to investigate the effect of different 2D nanocarbon materials (such as graphene and graphyne) in the thermal decomposition of liquid nitromethane. Our results indicate that graphene has almost no influences on the decomposition of nitro methane, hydroxyl-modified graphene acts as an accelerator. Graphyne and its oxygen-containing groups derivatives promote the decomposition process. CH3NO and CH2O are critical intermediates at the initial stage. These observations are helpful for understanding nanocarbon acceleration mechanism on nitro methane thermolysis and for designing novel 2D nanocarbon additives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Computational studies on nitro derivatives of BN indole as high energetic material,"Nitrogen-rich heterocycles and their nitro derivatives are one of the important classes of energetic materials. In the present study, the computational methods have been applied to determine the thermodynamic and detonation properties of nitro derivatives of BN indole molecule. Structure optimization and electronic energy of the designed molecules are determined using the density functional theory. The gas-phase heat of formation of the species concerned is determined by the atomization method. Wave function analysis-surface analysis suite (WFA-SAS) has been applied to determine the condensed phase heat of formation and crystal density of designed molecules. Bond dissociation energy (BDE) is determined to identify the trigger bond. The energy gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) has been calculated to predict the stability of the molecule. Impact sensitivity and detonation properties of designed species are calculated. The calculated parameters show that among all the designed molecules, the molecule A(6) (1,2,3,5,6,7-Hexanitrobnindole) has the properties to be considered as a high density energetic molecule.",2020
A mechanistic perspective of atmospheric oxygen sensitivity on composite energetic material reactions,"Solid energetic composites have been used and studied in standard air environments, yet the contribution of atmospheric oxygen to reactive material combustion has not been investigated. This study experimentally examines the effect of atmospheric oxygen concentration (4% or 93% oxygen) on energy propagation of nanometric aluminum with copper oxide (Al + CuO), iron oxide (Al + Fe2O3), calcium iodate (Al + Ca(IO3)(2)), and iodine pentoxide (1205). In all cases energy propagation was examined in terms of flame speed and higher in the high oxygen environments. However, the convectively dominant reactions showed a smaller percent increase in flame speed mainly attributed to the reaction mechanism. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Behavior of liquid energetic materials under the application of pulsed wire discharge,"In this study, we used high-speed photography and measurements with a piezo film stress gauge to investigate electrical discharge after the application of an energy discharge to a thin metal wire in a liquid energy material (nitromethane) in a vessel. The objective was to expand the applications of electric discharge fracturing technology in urban areas. Explosion of the metal wire occurred when a high voltage was applied, and a shock wave with relatively low pressure was generated. however, the reaction of the liquid energy material did not happen immediately after the discharge, but an intense explosive reaction gradually occurred after the wire explosion. The reaction products gradually expanded over time into a hemispherical shape at an expansion rate of similar to 185 m.s(-1).",2021
Sensitivity of Energetic Materials: Theoretical Relationships to Detonation Performance and Molecular Structure,"It has been known for decades that high performances for explosives (as characterized by detonation velocity D, detonation pressure P, or Gurney energy E-G) are connected with high impact sensitivities, i.e., low values of the drop weight impact height h(50). This trade-off is theoretically substantiated for the first time. It stems from the primary role of the amount of chemical energy evolved per atom for both performance and sensitivity. Under realistic assumptions, log(h(50)) increases linearly with D-4 or equivalently with P-2 or E-G(-1). This prediction proves consistent with experimental data for nonaromatic nitro compounds. The occurrence of different explosophores on the same molecule is suggested as a factor influencing the performance-sensitivity trade-off. Finally, it is shown that a large body of data may be explained by the present approach, which naturally integrates thermodynamic (energy content) as well as kinetic (activation energies) aspects. This model should help in designing powerful high energy compounds with acceptable sensitivity.",2017
"-Oxide 1,2,4,5-Tetrazine-Based High-Performance Energetic Materials","One route to high density and high performance energetic materials based on 1,2,4,5-tetrazine is the introduction of 2,4-di-N-oxide functionalities. Based on several examples and through theoretical analysis, the strategy of regioselective introduction of these moieties into 1,2,4,5-tetrazines has been developed. Using this methodology, various new tetrazine structures containing the N-oxide functionality were synthesized and fully characterized using IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal Xray analysis. Hydrogen peroxide (50%) was used very effectively in lieu of the usual 90% peroxide in this system to generate N-oxide tetrazine compounds successfully. Comparison of the experimental densities of N-oxide 1,2,4,5-tetrazine compounds with their 1,2,4,5-tetrazine precursors shows that introducing the N-oxide functionality is a highly effective and feasible method to enhance the density of these materials. The heats of formation for all compounds were calculated with Gaussian 03 (revision D.01) and these values were combined with measured densities to calculate detonation pressures (P) and velocities (v(D)) of these energetic materials (Explo 5.0 v.6.01). The new oxygen-containing tetrazines exhibit high density, good thermal stability, acceptable oxygen balance, positive heat of formation, and excellent detonation properties, which, in some cases, are superior to those of 1,3,5-tritnitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitrotriazacyclohexane (RDX), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX).",2014
Miniaturization of micrometric SiC from a detonation process of highly energetic material,"Submicron- and, in a low quantity nano-sized carbide particles were successfully prepared through a dynamic process of energetic material detonation. For that, a commercial micrometric SiC powder, homogeneously coated by a polymer layer, was dispersed in an energetic 2.4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) matrix and then detonated. After detonation, the resulting carbide material was characterized by several techniques such as X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopies, and nitrogen adsorption. The results showed a decrease in the initial micrometric SiC size with particle sizes reaching, in some cases, less than 20 nm. The specific surface area was also considerably increased since an approximate value of 7.8 m(2)g(-1) was obtained for a detonated SiC sample as opposed to 0.12 m(2)g(-1) for the initial micrometric SiC powder.

Extensive Theoretical Studies of a New Energetic Material: Tetrazino-tetrazine-tetraoxide (TTTO),"[1,2,3,4]Tetrazino-[5,6-e]-[1,2,3,4]tetrazine-[1,3,5,7]tetraoxide (TTTO, C2N8O4) was suggested to be a possible candidate of high energy density materials (HEDM). The most stable conformation of TTTO is a planar structure with C-2h symmetry. Using various high-level ab initio methods including Gaussian-n, Complete Basis Set, Full Coupled Cluster, and W1U models of chemistry together with density functional theory based models, the enthalpies of formation of TTTO at 0 K and standard state were calculated precisely. Moreover, the rovibrational and nuclear magnetic resonance properties were predicted as well. The solid state TTTO was studied using the crystal packing models with the Dreiding force-filed and the plane-wave periodic local-density approximation density functional theory. Three stable polymorphous cells of TTTO have been found with either P212121 or P21/C symmetry. The high heat of formation (>200 kcal/mol), the high density (>2.0 g/cm(3)), the planar nonpolar electronic structure, and the perfect oxygen balance lead TTTO be a very promising HEDM with exceptional performance. This work provides the first theoretical support for further experimental synthesis and testing. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 30: 1816-1820, 2009",2009
Review of the decomposition and energy release mechanisms of novel energetic materials,"Nowadays, some new materials with high-energy as well as a certain stability are emerging as the novel energetic materials (EMs), such as all-nitrogen energetic ionic compounds (EICs), high-pressure EMs, and special-structure EMs. These novel EMs differ much from traditional EMs in their intrinsic structure, and exhibit different decomposition and energy release mechanisms, which are attracting increasing attention. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive summary of the mechanisms. In view of this, this paper reviews for the first time the research progress of representative novel EMs in terms of the decomposition and energy release mechanisms, including the decomposition reaction path, energy barrier, reaction rate and reaction products, as well as the magnitude and speed of energy release, and compares them with traditional EMs. Finally, the existing issues and application potential in current novel EMs are proposed to guide future research directions. This paper will clarify the similarities and differences in decomposition and energy release mechanisms between novel and traditional EMs, and provide beneficial inspiration for the continuous innovation and application of EMs.",2024
Evaluating shock sensitivity and decomposition of energetic materials by ReaxFF molecular dynamics,"Amorphous models of locally ordered molecular packing were constructed to replace crystals and predict the shock sensibility and safety of energetic materials (EMs) using reactive molecular dynamics. We analyzed the simulation of shock-induced decomposition of EMs, comparing the effects of two different shock modes: the multiscale shock technique (MSST) and quantum-bath-coupled MSST (QBMSST). The rate of temperature rise and decomposition speed differ between these two modes. The critical initiation pressure in EMs is determined when the number of trigger bonds decreases by 15%. The values of the initial pressure for PETN, RDX, TNT, and TATB using QBMSST are 18.44, 24.51, 32.00, and 40.59 GPa, respectively, which are lower than those obtained using MSST. The shock wave sensitivities of these EMs in descending order are PETN, RDX, TNT, and TATB under these two shock modes, which is consistent with experiments. TATB has the highest bulk modulus obtained under both shock modes, followed by TNT, RDX, and PETN. This work demonstrated that the amorphous models like crystal models in the previous literature can be applicable to predict the sensitivity of EMs and could expected to be applicable in mixed or composite systems, including but not limited to shock sensitivities.",2024
"Thermally Stable 3,6-Dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole-based Energetic Materials","3,6-Dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole was prepared using an efficient modified process. With selected cations, ten nitrogen-rich energetic salts and three metal salts were synthesized in high yield based on the 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazolate anion. These compounds were fully characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopies, as well as elemental analyses. The structures of the neutral compounds4 and its salt 16 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showing extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions. The neutral pyrazole precursor and its salts are remarkably thermally stable. Based on the calculated heats of formation and measured densities, detonation pressures (22.5-35.4GPa) and velocities (7948-9005ms(-1)) were determined, and they compare favorably with those of TNT and RDX. Their impact and friction sensitivities range from 12 to >40J and 80 to 360N, respectively. These properties make them competitive as insensitive and thermally stable high-energy density materials.",2014
Templated Synthesis of Aluminum Nanoparticles - A New Route to Stable Energetic Materials,"Nanoscale structural cavities in ionomer membrane films were used as templates for the facile synthesis of small aluminum nanoparticles via catalytic decomposition of an alane precursor. The loading of reactive aluminum in the composite film could be varied, up to more than half of the film weight. While the embedded nanoparticles were protected by the membrane structure front any significant oxidation for the composite films to exhibit surprising stability in ambient air, they could be fully accessed in base water for the hydrogen production quantitatively. The templated synthesis may represent a new route for stable aluminum nanoparticles and related energetic nanomaterials.",2009
"Properties of heterogeneous energetic materials under high strain, high strain rate deformation","Heterogeneous energetic materials have many applications. Their dynamic behavior and microstructural evolution upon plastic deformation have remained not fully understood. The following heterogeneous materials were investigated in the this study: the pure PTFE (usually a mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases), PTFE-Sn, PTFE-Al, PTFE-Al-W, and carbon fibers filled Al alloy. Sample manufacturing processes involving ball milling and Cold Isostatic Pressing were employed. Quasi-static and Hopkinson bar tests were carried out to obtain the compressive strengths of composites. The Conventional Thick-walled Cylinder (TWC) method and newly developed small-scale Hopkinson bar based TWC experiments were conducted to investigate single shear bands and their assembly. Conventional and ""soft"" drop-weight tests were performed to examine the mechanical properties and the initiation of chemical reactions. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to detect the details of the microstructures and failure mechanisms of heterogeneous materials. New features in the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous materials were observed. They include the following: (1) Strain softening, instead of thermal softening, is the main mechanism in the initiation of shear bands in explosively driven TWC tests of solid PTFE. (2) Cold isostatically pressed PTFE-Sn samples were more stable with respect to shear localization than solid PTFE. (3) The dynamic collapse of solid PTFE-Al samples with different particle sizes was accomplished with the shear localization bands and cracks. (4) Force chains in the fine W and Al particles were attributed to the high strength of the porous PTFE-Al-W composite containing fine W particles in comparison with composites with coarse W particles. (5) Debonding of metal particles from the PTFE matrix and the fracture of the matrix were identified to be two major mechanisms for the failure of the PTFE-Al-W composites. (6) The formation of PTFE nano-fibers during high strain flow was detected. (7) The orientation of carbon fibers did not influence the strength and reaction of carbon fibers filled Al alloys, but the strength of carbon fibers did.",2007
Ignition criterion for heterogeneous energetic materials based on hotspot size-temperature threshold,"A criterion for the ignition of granular explosives (GXs) and polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under shock and non-shock loading is developed. The formulation is based on integration of a quantification of the distributions of the sizes and locations of hotspots in loading events using a cohesive finite element method (CFEM) developed recently and the characterization by Tarver et al. [C. M. Tarver et al., ""Critical conditions for impact-and shock-induced hot spots in solid explosives,"" J. Phys. Chem. 100, 5794-5799 (1996)] of the critical size-temperature threshold of hotspots required for chemical ignition of solid explosives. The criterion, along with the CFEM capability to quantify the thermal-mechanical behavior of GXs and PBXs, allows the critical impact velocity for ignition, time to ignition, and critical input energy at ignition to be determined as functions of material composition, microstructure, and loading conditions. The applicability of the relation between the critical input energy (E) and impact velocity of James [H. R. James, ""An extension to the critical energy criterion used to predict shock initiation thresholds,"" Propellants, Explos., Pyrotech. 21, 8-13 (1996)] for shock loading is examined, leading to a modified interpretation, which is sensitive to microstructure and loading condition. As an application, numerical studies are undertaken to evaluate the ignition threshold of granular high melting point eXplosive, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,2,3,5-tetrazocine (HMX) and HMX/Estane PBX under loading with impact velocities up to 350 ms(-1) and strain rates up to 10(5) s(-1). Results show that, for the GX, the time to criticality (t(c)) is strongly influenced by initial porosity, but is insensitive to grain size. Analyses also lead to a quantification of the differences between the responses of the GXs and PBXs in terms of critical impact velocity for ignition, time to ignition, and critical input energy at ignition. Since the framework permits explicit tracking of the influences of microstructure, loading, and mechanical constraints, the calculations also show the effects of stress wave reflection and confinement condition on the ignition behaviors of GXs and PBXs.

An unconstrained approach to systematic structural and energetic screening of materials interfaces,"From grain boundaries and heterojunctions to manipulating 2D materials, solid-solid interfaces play a key role in many technological applications. Understanding and predicting properties of these complex systems present an ongoing and increasingly important challenge. Over the last few decades computer simulation of interfaces has become vastly more powerful and sophisticated. However, theoretical interface screening remains based on largely heuristic methods and is strongly biased to systems that are amenable to modelling within constrained periodic cell approaches. Here we present an unconstrained and generally applicable non-periodic screening approach for systematic exploration of material's interfaces based on extracting and aligning disks from periodic reference slabs. Our disk interface method directly and accurately describes how interface structure and energetic stability depends on arbitrary relative displacements and twist angles of two interacting surfaces. The resultant detailed and comprehensive energetic stability maps provide a global perspective for understanding and designing interfaces. We confirm the power and utility of our method with respect to the catalytically important TiO2 anatase (101)/(001) and TiO2 anatase (101)/rutile (110) interfaces. Predicting structures and stabilities of solid-solid interfaces presents an ongoing and increasingly important challenge for development of new technologies.

Combustion and catalytic performance of metal-free heat-resistant energetic polymeric materials,"Energetic polymeric materials play vital roles in energetic materials fields to improve the comprehensive performances of rocket propellants and PBXs. Herein, four N-di/trinitrobenzene based heat-resistance energetic polymeric materials were synthesized via two facile approaches and fully characterized using FTIR, NMR, SEM and XRD. The combustion properties of energetic polymers were tested and recorded on a high-speed camera, physicochemical and energetic properties were also investigated. The results show that as-synthesized energetic polymers not only exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (the highest exothermic decomposition temperature of 336.7 degrees C) superior to those of GAP, poly(GLYN), triaminoguanidine-glyoxal polymer (TAGP) and graphene oxide (GO), but also produce great detonation and compatibility performance. In addition, the energetic polymer samples can be directly ignited without any additives. Worth noting that, we reported the thermal decomposition catalysis of AP by non-metallic energetic polymers as the first example, suggesting they can be potentially developed into metal-free catalysts replacing heavy metal-based energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) or energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs). In summary, as-prepared energetic polymeric materials represent great application potential in solid rocket propellants and PBXs due to their promising catalytic effect, excellent chemical and physical performances.",2020
Predicting the reactivity of energetic materials: an ,"The ease with which an energetic material (explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics) can be initiated is a critical parameter to assess their safety and application. Impact sensitivity parameters are traditionally derived experimentally, at great cost and risk to safety. In this work we explore a fully ab initio approach based on concepts of vibrational energy transfer to predict impact sensitivities for a series of chemically, structurally and energetically diverse molecular materials. The quality of DFT calculations is assessed for a subset of the materials by comparison with experimental inelastic neutron scattering spectra (INS). A variety of models are considered, including both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the vibrational spectra. Excellent agreement against experimental impact sensitivity is achieved by consideration of a multi-phonon ladder-type up-pumping mechanism that includes both overtone and combination pathways, and is improved further by the added consideration of temperature. This fully ab initio approach not only permits ranking of energetic materials in terms of their impact sensitivity but also provides a tool to guide the targeted design of advanced energetic compounds with tailored properties.",2019
Effect of initial damage variability on hot-spot nucleation in energetic materials,"Mechanical insult may be able to produce chemical transformations in solids when the energy is released in highly localized regions. This phenomenon is responsible for the nucleation of hotspots that are responsible for ignition of energetic materials. The concentration of energy at microstructural defects leads to the probabilistic nature of ignition. The effect of the microstructure of the energetic particles, specifically the influence of the initial crack distribution on the sensitivity to ignition, is studied for a particle embedded in a polymeric matrix at impact velocities 100 m/s and 400 m/s with finite element simulations that couple fracture dynamics and heat transport. A phase field damage model that includes heat sources due to frictional heating at the crack surfaces and heat dissipation during crack propagation is developed and verified. These heat sources are compared and, in the range of impact velocities studied, heat generation due to friction is more important than dissipation due to crack propagation. Hot-spots nucleated at 100 m/s do not reach the critical temperature while conditions consistent with the Lee-Tarver criterion for ignition are observed at 400 m/s impact velocity. The variability observed due to the stochasticity of the initial crack distribution is studied and it increases with a higher impact velocity. In particular, regions of high temperature develop close to cracks intersecting the particle polymer interface. Therefore, controlling the surface quality of the energetic particles may lead to a reduction on the sensitivity uncertainty in polymer-bonded explosives. Published by AIP Publishing.",2018
CFD Cook-Off Simulation and Thermal Decomposition of Confined High Energetic Material,"The handling, storage and safety before deployment of explosives are major key issues that confront the ammunition industry. Precautions have to be taken not to cause premature detonations and fatal accidents by studying their thermal behaviour. Research has been conducted to investigate the thermal stability of some secondary explosives such as RDX, HMX and TNT and their response to thermal stimuli. For the fact that real experiment which involves large amount of explosives can be potentially dangerous, cook-off numerical simulation and experiment has been regarded as the best method to analyse such thermal behaviour of explosives. Prominent among these researches involve experiment and numerical analysis such as ODTX, SITI, and DDT experiments. In this work, numerical CFD simulation will be executed for the thermal behaviour of TNT including cook-off and thermal decomposition. The heating rates were varied for both slow and fast cook-off cases. In view of these thermal decomposition reactions which mainly consist of kinetic parameters were factored in the numerical simulation as well as the critical thermodynamic physical properties. To effectively handle the reactions, UDF was employed. Attention was paid on the melting time to ignition of explosive, the location likely for ignition occurrence, as well as temperature distribution in the course of the heating process. CFD simulation results showed that the location of ignition was around the supplementary charge.",2015
Hot spot generation in energetic materials created by long-wavelength infrared radiation,"Hot spots produced by long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) radiation in an energetic material, crystalline RDX (1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine), were studied by thermal-imaging microscopy. The LWIR source was a CO2 laser operating in the 28-30THz range. Hot spot generation was studied using relatively low intensity (similar to 100W cm(-2)), long-duration (450 ms) LWIR pulses. The hot spots could be produced repeatedly in individual RDX crystals, to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of hot spot generation by LWIR, since the peak hot-spot temperatures were kept to similar to 30K above ambient. Hot spots were generated preferentially beneath RDX crystal planes making oblique angles with the LWIR beam. Surprisingly, hot spots were more prominent when the LWIR wavelength was tuned to be weakly absorbed (absorption depth similar to 30 mu m) than when the LWIR wavelength was strongly absorbed (absorption depth similar to 5 mu m). This unexpected effect was explained using a model that accounts for LWIR refraction and RDX thermal conduction. The weakly absorbed LWIR is slightly focused underneath the oblique crystal planes, and it penetrates the RDX crystals more deeply, increasing the likelihood of irradiating RDX defect inclusions that are able to strongly absorb or internally focus the LWIR beam.

"Nitrogen-rich energetic 4-R-5-nitro-1,2,3-triazolate salts (R = -CH","A series of 4-R-5-nitro-1,2,3-triazolate salts (R = -CH3, -NH2, -NO2, -N-3, and -NHNO2) were synthesized with cations of ammonium, hydroxylammonium, hydrazinium, guanidinium, aminoguanidinium, diaminoguanidinium, and triaminoguanidinium. The resulting energetic salts were characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and in some cases by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Their key properties were measured or calculated such as melting and decomposition temperatures, density, detonation pressure and velocity, and impact and friction sensitivities. The results show that guanidinium salts possess the highest thermal stability in each group with decomposition temperatures of 265, 251, 221, 142, and 216 degrees C, respectively. Hydroxylammonium 4,5-dinitro-1,2,3-triazolate and dihydroxylammonium 4-nitramino-5-nitro-1,2,3-triazolate exhibit much higher detonation performances (38.0 GPa and 9302 m s(-1); 38.8 GPa and 9464 m s(-1)) than cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (34.9 GPa and 8748 m s(-1)).

Nitrate anions embedded in rigid and cationic 3D energetic MOFs constructed by the chelating ligand towards insensitive energetic materials,"Balancing the conflict between energy and mechanical sensitivities is still one of the most challenging issues in the field of energetic materials (EMs). The NO3- anion has attracted widespread attention in the preparation of EMs because of rich oxygen contents and excellent energy densities. In this work, a 3D energetic metal-organic framework (EMOF) {[Zn-2(mu(2)-OH)(datz)(2)(H2O)](NO3)}(n) 1 (Hdatz = 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole) was constructed by chelating the nitrogen-rich Hdatz ligand and NO3- anions. The structural analysis demonstrates that the Hdatz ligand chelated with surrounding binuclear metal centers to construct [Zn-O-Zn] structural units, resulting in the formation of highly stable five-membered fused rings, which contribute to the construction of a 3D cationic framework. Additionally, free NO3- anions are encapsulated by the cationic 3D frameworks and stabilized by robust hydrogen-bonding interactions in the channels. The values of enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f degrees) and heat of detonation (Delta H-det) of 1 are high up to 3478 kJ mol(-1) and 5.316 kJ g(-1). In addition, compound 1 has a relatively good thermal decomposition temperature of 161 degrees C and excellent low impact (IS > 40 J) and friction (FS >360 N) sensitivities. These results demonstrate that 1 can serve as a potential insensitive EM. This unique structural feature also presents an effective reference for developing advanced EMs.",2024
Templated synthesis of Cr,"A facile templated approach has been developed for the synthesis of Cr2O3 chromium (III) oxide material with low particle size and tunable textural properties. While chromium nitrate nonahydrate was used as chromium source, fumed silica was selected as template. The Cr2O3 powders were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microcopy and nitrogen physisorption. Results showed that the particles size and the textural properties of the as-synthesized Cr(2)O(3)materials depend on the fumed silica/Cr-precursor weight ratio. Used in energetic composites, like nanothermites implementing metal and oxide nanopowders, the silicatemplated Cr2O3 material leads both to make easier the ignition and to increase the combustion velocity of the mixture.",2019
Combining the furoxanylhydrazone framework with various energetic functionalities to prepare new insensitive energetic materials with 3D-cube layer stacking,"A series of furoxanylhydrazone-derived energetic compounds including salts and neutral compounds were systematically studied using 3-methyl-4-furoxancarbaldehyde as a versatile starting material. Target compounds present a 3D-cube layer crystal packing style due to the special structure of furoxanylhydrazone and vast hydrogen bonds. This configuration breaks through the limitation of the 2D-plane layer structure. Target compounds, which feature such characteristics, exhibit excellent sensitivities toward impact and friction (IS > 24 J; FS > 180 N) and acceptable energetic performance. Moreover, the detonation velocities and pressures of all ionic compounds (6-9, 11-13) were both increased relative to their corresponding neutral compounds. Compared with 5-(3 '-methylfuroxanyl)methyleneamino-tetrazole (10), the sensitivities to impact and friction of its anion salts (11-13) were also lowered to some extent. The structure-property relationship was studied using theoretical calculations, crystal structure analysis and energetic properties. It is noted that five types of crystal packing have been analyzed, which may be useful for the further understanding of crystal and chemical phenomena in energetic materials.

Interaction of energetic clusters (Au,"Using molecular dynamics simulations (MD), this contribution compares the interaction of three energetic clusters (AU(3), AU(400) and C-60) with a hybrid surface of crystalline polyethylene (PE) covered by a layer of gold nanoparticles. This model system mimics the situation encountered in metal-assisted secondary ion mass spectrometry. The chosen impact points are representative of the PE surface, the metal particles and the frontier between the metal and the polymer. The simulations show the differences between the impact over the Au nanoparticle and the polymer surface, in terms of projectile penetration, crater formation and sputtering yield of PE and gold species. For C-60 and Au-3 projectiles, a simple correlation is found between the quantity of energy deposited in the top polymeric layers and the quantity of sputtered polymer material, including all the impact points. The results obtained with Au-400 do not fit on this line, indicating that other physical parameters are prevalent. The mechanistic view of the interaction provided by the MD helps explain the differences. In short, while C-60 and Au-3 quickly break apart, creating energetic recoils and severing many bonds in the surface, Au-400, with the largest total momentum by far (similar to 10 times larger than the others) and the lowest energy per atom (25 eV), tends to act and implant in the solid as a single entity, pushing the polymeric material downwards and breaking few bonds in the surface.

Nanoscale high energetic materials:: A polymeric nitrogen chain N,"We present a theoretical study of a new hybrid material, nanostructured polymeric nitrogen, where a polymeric nitrogen chain is encapsulated in a carbon nanotube. The electronic and structural properties of the new system are studied by means of ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations. Finite temperature simulations demonstrate the stability of this nitrogen phase at ambient pressure and room temperature using carbon nanotube confinement. This nanostructured confinement may open a new path towards stabilizing polynitrogen or polymeric nitrogen at ambient conditions.",2008
Article Exploring an accurate machine learning model to quickly estimate stability of diverse energetic materials,"High energy and low sensitivity have been the focus of developing new energetic materials (EMs). However, there has been a lack of a quick and accurate method for evaluating the stability of diverse EMs. Here, we develop a machine learning prediction model with high accuracy for bond dissociation energy (BDE) of EMs. A reliable and representative BDE dataset of EMs is constructed by collecting 778 experimental energetic compounds and quantum mechanics calculation. To sufficiently characterize the BDE of EMs, a hybrid feature representation is proposed by coupling the local target bond into the global structure characteristics. To alleviate the limitation of the low dataset, pairwise difference regression is utilized as a data augmentation with the advantage of reducing systematic errors and improving diversity. Benefiting from these improvements, the XGBoost model achieves the best prediction accuracy with R 2 of 0.98 and MAE of 8.8 kJ mol - 1 , significantly outperforming competitive models.",2024
SURVIVABILITY OF FIRST-WALL MATERIALS IN FUSION DEVICES: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO PULSED ENERGETIC IONS,"The confining walls in future fusion power plants will be subjected to an intense energetic bombardment from X-rays, ions, and neutrons. This is true for both direct-drive inertial fusion energy (IFE) and magnetic fusion energy (MFE) designs. We focus in this paper on the threat spectra presented by energetic ions. X-rays are predicted to present a less significant threat indirect-drive IFE, and neutron effects cannot be readily simulated in current experimental facilities. For the experimental results presented herein, the energetic ions are generated in the Repetitive High-Energy Pulsed Power 1 (RHEPP-1) facility at Sandia National Laboratories. Depending upon whether the ion pulses are of nitrogen (previous database) or helium (this paper), the pulse width varies from 100 ns to as much as 500 ns, respectively. While this is short compared to similar to 500-mu s transient events anticipated in MFE operation, data from both IFE and MFE experiments for tungsten exposure are shown to exhibit similar fluence thresholds when thermal diffusion is taken into account by use of the heat flux parameter H = Power density x t(1/2), where t is the characteristic event time duration. Long-term exposure of tungsten to RHEPP-1 nitrogen pulses indicates that above a level of similar to 1 J.cm(-2)/pulse, polycrystalline tungsten roughens severely, the cause of which appears to be thermomechanical distress, with loosening of grains near the surface the primary result. This roughening is correlated with unacceptable mass loss. While this occurs below melting temperatures, allowing the surface to melt by raising the per-pulse fluence does not appear to be a viable approach to smoothing the surface. Oriented grain material such as ITER-specified tungsten performs significantly better than polycrystalline tungsten, but under helium exposure it appears to suffer additional surface deterioration that appears to be connected to helium pore and bubble formation at absorbed implantation levels of mid-10(15) He/cm(2). This level is below previously reported levels of concern for helium retention effects and well short of required survival duration. Experiments with three-dimensional ""needle"" geometries, designed to increase the effective surface area for heat absorption and reduce helium implantation in depth, show promising results that need further investigation to confirm long-term survival.",2012
Catalytic decomposition of ammonium dinitramide (ADN) as high energetic material over CuO-based catalysts (Retracted Article),"CuO supported on a La2O3-doped alumina catalyst was prepared and tested in the decomposition process of an ADN-water energetic propellant. The decomposition products were investigated via on-line analysis. Moreover, CuO/Al2O3-La2O3 shows better results of ADN decomposition in comparison with CuO/Al2O3. Both catalysts were characterized by physico-chemical techniques.",2013
Thermal studies of novel molecular perovskite energetic material (C,"(C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] is a newly developed porous hybrid inorganic-organic framework material with easy access and excellent detonation performances, however, its thermal properties is still unclear and severely hampered further applications. In this study, thermal behaviors and non-isothermal decomposition reaction kinetics of (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] were investigated systematically by the combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous thermal analysis methods. In-situ FTIR spectroscopy technology was applied for investigation of the structure changes of (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] and some selected referents for better understanding of interactions between different components during the heating process. Experiment results indicated that the novel molecular perovskite structure renders (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] better thermal stability than most of currently used energetic materials. Under high temperatures, the stability of the cage skeleton constructed by NH4+ and ClO4- ions determined the decomposition process rather than organic moiety confined in the skeleton. The simple synthetic method, good detonation performances and excellent thermal properties make (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] an ideal candidate for the preparation of advanced explosives and propellants.

"Simple Preparation of Heat-Resistant Energetic Materials Based on [5,6,5] Tricyclic Fused-Ring Skeletons and Evaluation of Their Energetic Performance","In recent years, there has been great interest in the development of high-performance heat-resistant energetic materials owing to their widespread applications in civilian and national defense technologies. Herein, four heat-resistant energetic materials, i.e., 9H-imidazo[4,5-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-6-amine (1), 9H-imidazo[4,5-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-6-amine perchlorate (2), 9H-imidazo[4,5-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine-6,8-diamine (3), and 9H-imidazo[4,5-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine-6,8-diamine perchlorate (4), were prepared and comprehensively studied. Compounds 1-4 having unique [5,6,5] tricyclic fused-ring molecular structures were prepared via a simple one-step reaction. All of the compounds exhibited excellent thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures exceeding 309 degrees C. The highest decomposition temperature (421 degrees C) was observed for compound 3. The excellent thermal stability of these compounds was found to be strongly related to their tricyclic fused-ring molecular skeleton structures. In addition, compounds 2 and 4 exhibited high density with the values of 1.882 and 1.93 g cm(-3), respectively, which were comparable to the highly energetic material, octogen (HMX, 1.91 g cm(-3)). The calculated detonation velocities of those compounds were in the range of 6996-8329 m s(-1). The highest value observed for compound 4 was 8329 m s(-1), and it was higher than that of the heat-resistant material, 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB, 8176 m s(-1)). Notably, all of the compounds displayed great mechanical sensitivities, with the impact sensitivities being higher than 20 J. The simple preparation methods and comprehensive performance make these materials have great potential as heat-resistant energetic materials.",2024
"Furazans with Azo Linkages: Stable CHNO Energetic Materials with High Densities, Highly Energetic Performance, and Low Impact and Friction Sensitivities","Various highly energetic azofurazan derivatives were synthesized by simple and efficient chemical routes. These nitrogen-rich materials were fully characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Four of them were further confirmed structurally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These compounds exhibit high densities, ranging from 1.62gcm(-3) up to a remarkably high 2.12gcm(-3) for nitramine-substituted azofurazan DDAzF (2), which is the highest yet reported for an azofurazan-based CHNO energetic compound and is a consequence of the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding networks. From the heats of formation, calculated with Gaussian09, and the experimentally determined densities, the energetic performances (detonation pressure and velocities) of the materials were ascertained with EXPLO5 v6.02. The results suggest that azofurazan derivatives exhibit excellent detonation properties (detonation pressures of 21.8-46.1GPa and detonation velocities of 6602-10114ms(-1)) and relatively low impact and friction sensitivities (6.0-80J and 80-360N, respectively). In particular, they have low electrostatic spark sensitivities (0.13-1.05J). These properties, together with their high nitrogen contents, make them potential candidates as mechanically insensitive energetic materials with high-explosive performance.",2016
Synthesis and energetic properties of homocubane based high energy density materials,"The energetic properties of homocubane derivatives have been evaluated for the first time. The newly synthesized compounds have been fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray analysis. Detailed computational studies carried out using the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory reveal that these compounds have higher densities and higher heat of formation as compared to common hydrocarbon fuels. The calculated performances of these compounds in terms of their ballistic properties, particularly density specific impulse (rho I-sp), in liquid and in solid propellant systems are substantially superior to those of the conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB, respectively. TGA-DTG analysis confirmed that most of these compounds are thermally stable with high onset temperatures. Most of the compounds, except oxadiazole, triazole and triazine containing cages, are also kinetically stable in terms of their HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Quite remarkably, three compounds emerged as excellent candidates for volume-limited applications owing to their high density, density specific impulse as well as kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities.",2021
"Synthesis, Characterization and Performance of Promising Energetic Materials Based on 1,3-Oxazinane","1,3-oxazinane is an ideal framework for advanced energetic materials because of its compact skeleton and the presence of several modifiable sites. However, investigations on characterization and performance of 1,3-oxazinane energetic compounds are extremely limited. Two heterocyclic 1,3-oxazinane molecules were synthesized under different Mannich condensation processes and further reacted to form nitro- and azide-substituted energetic compounds 3,5,5-trinitro-1,3-oxazinane (TNTON) and 5-azido-3,5-dinitro-1,3-oxazinane (ADTON), in good yields. Interestingly, the two energetic molecules showed distinct physical properties. ADTON shows an impressive glass transition temperature (Tg) as low as -46 degrees C with high density, which is highly suitable for rate-accelerating materials. TNTON exhibits good thermal stabilities (melting point of 89 degrees C and a decomposition point of 231 degrees C) and highly insensitive behavior (38 J, 360 N). The theoretical detonation pressure of TNTON is ca. 63 % higher than that of TNT, indicating broad application prospects in melt-cast explosives.",2019
Experimental and Numerical Investigations of Thermal Ignition of a Phase Changing Energetic Material,"Fortuitous exposure to high temperatures initiates reaction in energetic materials and possibilities of such event are of great concern in terms of the safe and controlled usage of explosive devices. Experimental and numerical investigations on time to explosion and location of ignition of a phase changing polymer bonded explosive material (80 per cent RDX and 20 per cent binder), contained in a metallic confinement subjected to controlled temperature build-up on its surface, are presented. An experimental setup was developed in which the polymer bonded explosive material filled in a cylindrical confinement was provided with a precise control of surface heating rate. Temperature at various radial locations was monitored till ignition. A computational model for solving two dimensional unsteady heat transfer with phase change and heat generation due to multi-step chemical reaction was developed. This model was implemented using a custom field function in the framework of a finite volume method based standard commercial solver. Numerical study could simulate the transient heat conduction, the melting pattern of the explosive within the charge and also the thermal runaway. Computed values of temperature evolution at various radial locations and the time to ignition were closely agreeing with those measured in experiment. Results are helpful both in predicting the possibility of thermal ignition during accidents as well as for the design of safety systems.",2016
Nanocomposite and mechanically alloyed reactive materials as energetic additives in chemical oxygen generators,"Chemical oxygen generators are widely used for aircraft, spacecraft, submarines, and mine rescue. Oxygen-generating compositions typically include alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate that decomposes at increased temperatures, a transition-metal oxide as a decomposition catalyst, and a metal fuel that reacts with part of the produced oxygen to provide heat for a self-sustained propagation of the decomposition/combustion wave. To increase the oxygen yield per unit mass, it is of interest to minimize the amount of metal fuel, but decreasing its content leads to pulsating combustion and undesired fluctuations of the oxygen flow rate. The present paper explores the feasibility of replacing iron and tin, currently used in oxygen generators, with reactive materials, produced by arrested reactive milling and by mechanical alloying. Because of their high energy density, easy ignition, and good storability, these materials have the potential to improve the performance characteristics of oxygen generators. Thermodynamic calculations for combustion of sodium chlorate mixed with various reactive materials identified the most attractive additives providing high temperatures and high oxygen yield. Experiments on combustion of sodium chlorate-based mixtures with nanoscale cobalt oxide catalyst and the most promising energetic additives were conducted in an argon environment, using laser ignition. Infrared video recording was used to investigate the thermal wave propagation over the mixture pellet. The experiments have shown that mechanically alloyed Al/Mg (1:1 mass ratio) material is a promising alternative to iron and tin, because significantly smaller amounts of this additive are needed for a steady propagation of the combustion wave.

Calculation of the Response of a Gasifying Energetic Material Exposed to Monochromatic Radiation,It is shown that the steady-state gasification of a homogeneous energetic material with exothermic subsurface reactions has stability boundaries for small and large values of the radiant flux. Examples of corresponding calculation using a transient combustion model are given. A possible method of accounting for the subsurface reactions on the transparency of an energetic material is considered (with examples of numerical calculation). The gasification rate response function of an inert material to small variations in the radiant flux is found analytically. Knowledge of this function allows one to obtain information on some thermal and optical characteristics of an energetic material using relatively simple experiments.,2011
Studies on Thermal Decomposition of Energetic Materials by Dynamic Vacuum Stability Test Method,"Dynamic Vacuum Stability Test (DVST) method based on the manometry principle of VST can track and test thermal decomposition of energetic materials real-time, continuously and directly as a new thermal analysis method. The thermal decomposition of TATB, RDX, HMX and CL-20 were investigated by DVST. Activation energy (E) and pre-exponential factor (A) at 100 degrees C can be obtained through the non-isothermal DVST method, while the reaction model (G(alpha)) and reaction rate constant (k) of the samples were obtained by the isothermal DVST method. Futhermore, DVST can determine the thermal stability of the energetic materials more accurately than traditional VST.",2011
Theoretical study of void collapse and hot spot formation mechanism for energetic material,"Based on molecular dynamics simulation, we find that hot spot in explosive is induced by inelastic impaction between void faces and develop a physical model to describe the temperature rising mechanism. A set of thermodynamic parameters for void collapse and hot spot is calculated. The hot spot relaxation time is proportional to square of hot spot size, and the plastic work is proportional to hot spot volume. A complete physical picture for hot spot formation is obtained.",2023
Nitrated Graphene Oxide Derived from Graphite Oxide: A Promising Energetic Two-Dimensional Material,"In order to synthesize a novel two-dimensional energetic material, nitrated graphene oxide (NGO) was prepared by the nitrification of graphite oxide to make a functional modification. Based on the morphological characterization, the NGO has a greater degree of curl and more wrinkles on the surface. The structure characterization and density functional theory calculation prove that epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the edge of graphite oxide have reacted with nitronium cation (NO2+) to produce nitro and nitrate groups. Hydrophobicity of NGO implied higher stability in storage than graphene oxide. Synchronous simultaneous analysis was used to explore the decomposition mechanism of NGO preliminarily. The decomposition enthalpy of NGO is 662.0 J center dot g(-1) and the activation energy is 166.5 kJ center dot mol(-1). The thermal stability is similar to that of general nitrate energetic materials. The hygroscopicity, thermal stability and flammability of NGO prove that it is a novel two-dimensional material with potential applications as energetic additives in the catalyst, electrode materials and energetic devices.",2021
Computational study of transition states for reaction path of energetic material TKX-50,"Dihydroxylammonium5,5-bistetrazole-1,1-diolate (TKX-50) is considered as one of the new ionic energetic materials. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) method to calculate the reaction path of TKX-50 and search its optimized configurations of reactants, reactant complexes (RCs), transition states (TSs), product complexes (PCs), and products. We proposed 10 simple reactions in the reaction path, and determined their transition states. Among these TSs, six of them have lower energies than those of reactants. The equilibrium constants, which indicate the limitation of reactions, were computed from the difference of Gibbs free energy with temperature change. Based on the proposed reaction path, the reaction mechanism of TKX-50 was provided.",2019

Inelastic scattering investigations of vibrational and lattice interactions of the energetic material RDX,"This dissertation investigates the molecular vibrational and lattice interactions of single crystals of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), an explosive compound used extensively in military applications. The stiffness tensor measured through Brillouin scattering studies on the acoustic phonons indicate that RDX is most compliant along the crystallographic c axis and least compliant along the crystallographic a axis. Calculation of the linear compressibility using the compliance tensor indicates that single crystals of RDX exhibit nearly isotropic compressibility in all three crystallographic planes. This is consistent with reported hydrostatic compression studies on RDX. The molecular vibrations of RDX have been characterized using single-crystal, polarized Raman scattering. The six elements of the scattering tensor for the orthorhombic crystal system were calculated to reveal four different modal symmetries. The RDX molecule is distorted in the lattice to C s symmetry, with molecules sitting at C 1 sites in the D 2h unit cell. This arrangement effectively destroys the expected modal symmetries; all molecular vibrational modes should be seen in all of the elements of the scattering tensor. A total of 50 separate vibrations were identified in the molecular region of the Raman spectrum. Analysis revealed that 20 of the vibrations arose from vibrational fundamentals and the remaining 30 arose from overtones and combination bands. The existence of certain overtones and combination bands, along with published RDX solution spectra, confirm the existence of fundamental molecular vibrations at low energy shifts. In addition, the number of combination bands and overtones suggest that many of the fundamental modes are highly anharmonic in nature. The optical phonons of RDX were also characterized using polarized, single-crystal Raman scattering. A total of 24 lattice phonon modes were found by probing the four different modal symmetries. The phonon located at 35 cm −1 in the B 2g symmetry has not been previously reported. Piezomodulated Raman scattering studies on single-crystals of RDX showed the lattice modes and several molecular modes to be anharmonic in nature. Coupling between vibrational modes is clearly present, but unfavorable signal to noise ratios prevented quantitative assessment of their anharmonicity.",2005
Laser photofragmentation-fragment detection and pyrolysis-laser-induced fluorescence studies on energetic materials.,"Trace concentrations of energetic materials such as 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and hexahydro-1, 3, 5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX) are detected by laser photofragmentation-fragment detection (PF-FD) spectrometry. In this technique, a single laser operating near 227 nm photofragments the parent molecule and facilitates the detection of the characteristic NO fragment by means of its A (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Sigma (0, 0) transitions near 227 nm. Fragment detection is accomplished by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization with miniature electrodes and by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) with a photodetector. Experiments are also conducted in the visible region by use of 453.85-nm radiation for photofragmentation and fragment detection. Sand samples contaminated with PETN and RDX are analyzed by a pyrolysis-LIF technique, which involves pyrolysis of the energetic material with subsequent detection of the pyrolysis products NO and NO(2) by LIF and PF-LIF, respectively, near 227 nm. The application of these techniques to the trace analysis of TNT, PETN, and RDX at ambient pressure in room air is demonstrated with limits of detection (signal-to-noise ratio, 3) in the low parts-in-10(9) to parts-in-10(6) range for a 20-s integration time and 10-120 microJ of laser energy at 226.8 nm and approximately 5 mJ at 453.85 nm. An increase in detection sensitivity is projected with an increase in laser energy and an improved system design. The analytical merits of these techniques are discussed and compared with those of other laser-based techniques.",t-20
Preparation of novel heat-resistant and insensitive fused ring energetic materials,"Compared with traditional polycyclic-based heterocyclic energetic compounds, the synthesis of fused ring compounds is more challenging since only a few substrates meet the structural requirements for a fused cyclization reaction. In the case of a limited number of substrates, it is necessary to explore other methods to synthesize new fused ring compounds. Here, through the cyclization reaction of 1H-pyrazole-4-carbimidate (4) and hydrazinyl compounds, a series of nitrogen-rich heterocyclic fused compounds were synthesized in this work. The method of synthesizing fused compounds in this work is rarely reported in the energetic field. In addition, the newly synthesized compounds 5-7 and 10-11 demonstrate excellent thermal stability. Compounds 5 (Td = 360 degrees C) and 6 (Td = 372 degrees C) have higher initial decomposition temperatures than 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB: Td = 350 degrees C). Moreover, the newly synthesized compounds 5-7 and 10-11 show low sensitivity (IS: 26 to 40 J, FS: 288 to 360 N). The detonation velocities of compounds 7 and 11 are 8047 and 8004 m s-1, respectively, which are obviously higher than that of the famous heat resistant explosive 2-bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) ethene (HNS: Dv = 7612 m s-1) and slightly lower than that of TATB (Dv = 8179 m s-1). This work is anticipated to motivate researchers to comprehensively consider multiple heat-resistance-imparting strategies for designing heat-resistant explosives, and expand the train of thought for the scientific development of advanced heat-resistant explosives. Compared with traditional polycyclic-based heterocyclic energetic compounds, the synthesis of fused ring compounds is more challenging since only a few substrates meet the structural requirements for a fused cyclization reaction.",2024
Structural properties of solid energetic materials: a van der Waals density functional study,"In the present work we have focused our attention towards the complete description of structural properties of energetic solids, namely inorganic azides, secondary explosives and oxidizers through density functional theory-based calculations. We find large deviations in structural parameters calculated with the standard exchange-correlation functional such as local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). On the other hand, dispersion-corrected density functional of (GGA + G06) describes the crystal structure of the energetic solids with good accuracy. This leads to the fact that the dispersion-corrected density functionals are essential to describe the crystal structure and thereby the related physical and chemical properties of the energetic solids.",2014
New high nitrogen compounds azoxytriazolone (AZTO) and azotriazolone (azoTO) as insensitive energetic materials,"The new, electrochemically-synthesised high nitrogen materials AZTO and azoTO have been characterised by a range of techniques and compared to existing insensitive high explosives (IHE). AZTO, produced via electrolysis of aqueous NTO solutions, shows similar sensitiveness to NTO in most tests, but has better thermal stability. AzoTO displays higher thermal and impact stability than AZTO but is more sensitive to electrostatic discharge. AZTO sensitiveness is not affected by the presence of azoTO (formed concomitantly during synthesis) at levels of <20%. Crude samples and recrystallised samples react similarly in the tests performed. The ease of synthesis, low sensitiveness and moderate energy output suggest AZTO may be an economical and environmentally-friendly addition to the existing range of IHE.",2012
Structural and energetic analysis of the hydrogen storage materials LiNH,"Ammonia borane (NH3BH3) possesses many appealing properties as a hydrogen storage material; however, the release of trace amounts of borazine during the desorption process is troublesome. Recently, it was found that substitution of one of the H atoms in the NH3 group by Li or Na could significantly improve the hydrogen desorption properties. The resulting lithium amidoborane (LiNH2BH3) and sodium amidoborane (NaNH2BH3) compounds have been studied by us using density-functional theory. Specifically, we have succeeded in determining the detailed crystal structures of LiNH2BH3 and NaNH2BH3, including the atomic positions in their respective unit cells. Calculated hydrogen removal energies of the hydrogen release reactions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental trend.",2009
Probing zinc oxide as a semiconductor photosensitizer of energetic materials to laser radiation,"The development of methods for laser ignition of energetic materials opens up significant prospects for improving the safety of their application. The photochemical processes can increase the selective sensitivity of energetic material to laser radiation and make the most of its capabilities. The paper considers the application of zinc oxide as a photosensitizing additive capable of significantly reducing the laser ignition threshold of pen-taerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The dependencies of the laser initiation threshold by the fundamental frequency (1064 nm), second (532 nm), and third harmonic (355 nm) of an Nd:YAG laser on the concentration of zinc oxide were studied. The ignition threshold energy density is reduced by a factor from 2 to 5, depending on the oxide concentration and the laser radiation wavelength. The proposed initiation mechanisms based on the results of the several spectroscopy methods were discussed for each laser harmonic. Laser ignition of the PETN-ZnO composite through the ultraviolet laser radiation combined the thermal and photochemical mechanism. Visible laser har-monic (532 nm) drives a purely photochemical initiation of the PETN. The obtained results indicate that a mechanism of initiation by visible light should be caused by the charge transfer in the ZnO-PETN interface. The reported experimental result does not only serve as an example of the successful photochemical ignition of energetic material but also shows that processes, techniques, and materials of semiconductor photocatalysis are applicable to laser initiation.",2023
ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Hydrostatic and Uniaxial Compression of Nitrate Energetic Materials,"The physical and chemical properties of typical nitrate energetic materials under hydrostatic compression and uniaxial compression were studied using the ReaxFF/Ig force field combined with the molecular dynamics simulation method. Under hydrostatic compression, the P-V curve and the bulk modulus (B-0) obtained ETI vE 3 using the VFRS equation of state show that the compressibility of the three crystals is nitroglycerine (NG) > erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) > 2,3-bis-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dinitro-1,4-butanediol tetranitrate (NEST-0. The a- and c-axis of ETN are easy to compress under the action of hydrostatic pressure, but the b-axis is not easy to compress. The b-axis of NEST-1 is the most compressible, while the a- and c-axis can be compressed slightly when the initial pressure increases and then remains unchanged afterward. The a-, b-, and c-axes of NG all have similar compressibilities. By analyzing the change trend of the main bond lengths of the crystals, it can be seen that the most stable of the three crystals is the N-O bond and the largest change is in the O-NO2 bond. The stability of the C-O bond shows that the NO3 produced by nitrates is not from the C-O bond fracture. Under uniaxial compression, the stress tensor component, the average principal stress, and the hydrostatic pressure have similar trends and amplitudes, indicating that the anisotropy behaviors of the three crystals ETN, NEST-1, and NG are weak. There is no significant correlation between maximum shear stress and sensitivity. The maximum shear stresses tau(xy) and tau(yz), of the ETN in the [010] direction are 1.5 GPa higher than tau(xz). However, the maximum shear stress of NG shows irregularity in different compression directions, indicating that there is no obvious correlation between the maximum shear stress and sensitivity.",2020

This work underscores the scope of energetic functionalization and the outstanding comprehensive performance of polycyclic tetrazines.",2024
"Pyrazine 1,4-Dioxide is a Prolific Cocrystal Former and Energetic Material Itself","Pyrazine 1,4-dioxide (PZDO) is a chemical frequently employed as a coformer in cocrystal design. It has two N-oxide fragments that signify potential hazards, but we found no information about it in prior literature. Therefore, we investigate the thermal behavior, thermochemical properties, and mechanical sensitivity of the title compound. We demonstrate that the material explodes in standard impact tests at a certain drop energy. By the level of its computed energetic potential, PZDO approaches benchmark trinitrotoluene. We screened ten energetic materials for cocrystal formation with PZDO using thermal analysis methods and predicted three novel cocrystals. However, we failed to grow the X-ray quality crystals by the conventional approach due to significantly differing solubility of PZDO and other components in common solvents. Two suitable coarse cocrystals of 3,4-dinitropyrazole/PZDO and 3,5-dinitropyrazole/PZDO were finally prepared by resublimation (vacuum recondensation of preformed comelt), and its X-ray structure is reported. Overall, we characterize PZDO as an energetic material and highlight the potential risks associated with the compound. The preparation of cocrystals via the gas phase route, although laborious, may be effective when the traditional (via solution) approach fails.",2024
Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics Study of Chapman-Jouguet Detonation Events of Energetic Materials,"Detonation of energetic materials (EMs) is of great importancefor military applications, while the understanding of detailed eventsand mechanisms for the detonation process is scarce. In this study,the first deep neural network potential NNP_Shock for molecular dynamics(MD) simulation of shock-induced detonation of EMs was generated basedon a deep potential model, providing DFT accuracy but 10(6) times the computational efficiency. On this basis, we employ ourdeep potential to perform MD simulations of shock-induced detonationof high-performance EM material 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane(CL-20, C6H6N12O12) andobtain the theoretical Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation velocitiesand pressures directly by multiscale shock technique (MSST) for thefirst time, which are in good agreement with experiment. In addition,the Hugoniot curves and initial reaction mechanisms were successfullyobtained. Therefore, the NNP_Shock potential is competent in researchof the detonation performance and shock sensitivity of CL-20, andthe method can also be transplanted to studies of other EMs.",2023
Preparation of quasi-core/shell structured composite energetic materials to improve combustion performance,"Composite explosives with fast reaction rate, high energy release efficiency, and remarkable combustion performance can be obtained by the interaction between homogeneous energetic materials and heterogeneous energetic materials and have broad application prospects. However, ordinary physical mixtures can easily cause separation between the components in the preparation process, which is not conducive to reflecting the advantages of composite materials. In this study, high-energy composite structured explosives with RDX modified by polydopamine as the core and PTFE/Al as the shell were prepared using a simple ultrasonic method. The study of morphology, thermal decomposition, heat release, and combustion performance demonstrated that the quasi-core/shell structured samples have higher exothermic energy, faster combustion rate, more stable combustion characteristics, and lower mechanical sensitivity than the physical mixture.",2023
Novel ammonium perchlorate/RDX co-crystal: bespoke energetic materials with tailored decomposition kinetics,"Ammonium perchlorate/cyclo-trimethylene-trinitramine (AP/RDX) co-crystal was accomplished via solvent sublimation. Proper dispersion of AP within RDX matrix was verified using EDAX detector. AP/RDX co-crystal experienced the evolution of novel crystalline structure with superior thermal behavior. AP/RDX co-crystal experienced an increase in RDX decomposition enthalpy by 70.6%. Furthermore, it revealed decrease in RDX activation energy by -60.0% and -59.5% using Kissinger and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose models, respectively. AP could bind effectively with RDX via hydrogen bonding and strong dipole-dipole interaction. This electrostatic bonding could be weakened at low temperature with the release of reactive species (ammonia and percholoric acid) that would catalyze RDX decomposition.",
"Progress and performance of energetic materials: open dataset, tool, and implications for synthesis","During the development of novel energetic materials first analysis of synthesized compounds includes both physico-chemical characterization and energetic potential evaluation. Evaluation of energetic performance includes determination of detonation parameters, which are most often calculated rather than experimentally determined. To accelerate development and enable the higher-throughput screening of energetic materials, there is a need for a large and open dataset of detonation parameters, and transparent and reliable procedures for calculation of these properties. Several detonation performance measures should be considered to cover a range of possible applications. In this study, we compiled a dataset of several detonation parameters of 260 CHNOFCl energetic compounds, including the experimental density, maximal density, solid-state enthalpy of formation, detonation velocity, Chapman-Jouguet pressure, calorimetric heat of detonation, and metal acceleration ability. This dataset was first analyzed to capture the trends in progress of energetic materials development, such as the move toward high-nitrogen and high-enthalpy compounds. Then, we benchmarked the available empirical and thermodynamic methods for the prediction of detonation properties. For detonation velocity, we specifically compared the output of 15 literature methods, and proposed a new equation which offers better accuracy as compared to other empirical methods and is slightly better than benchmark thermodynamic code EXPLO5. In addition, a new equation for metal acceleration ability is suggested in this present study. The recommended empirical methods are available at http://chemphys.space/shiny/pilem. With the help of recommended methods, detonation parameters for common and novel energetic materials that vary largely in chemical composition were analyzed and some implications for design of novel energetic materials are provided.",2022
Enhancement of explosion energy and mechanical strength of energetic material by aluminum fibre,"In order to enforce explosion energy and mechanical strength of energetic material, we use physics and chemistry property of aluminum fibre to improve the performance of energetic material. Before explosion the physics property of mechanical property can reinforce the mechanical strength; when explosion the reaction heat of aluminum can increase the energy of explosive. The air blast experimental results indicated that Al fibre can increase the energy of energetic material.. And the same time mechanical strength experimental results indicated that aluminum can enhance the strength of energetic material.",2013
"Derivatives of 5-nitro-1,2,3-2","The energetic derivatives of 5-nitro-1,2,3-2H-triazole, which include 2-(methyl or amino)-4-(nitramino, azido, or nitro)-5-nitro-1,2,3-2H-triazoles, were prepared in moderate yields, and confirmed with NMR and IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Their key properties, viz., melting and decomposition temperatures, densities, detonation pressures and velocities, and impact sensitivities, were measured or calculated. Among the new derivatives, 2-amino-4,5-dinitro-1,2,3-2H-triazole exhibits properties (T-m, 94 degrees C; T-d, 190 degrees C; rho, 1.83 g cm(-3); P, 36.2 Gpa, v(D), 8843 m s(-1), IS, 24 J), comparable with RDX (T-m, 205 degrees C; T-d, 230 degrees C; rho, 1.80 g cm(-3); P, 35.0 Gpa, v(D), 8762 m s(-1), IS, 7.5 J), and may have potential as a high-performance energetic material.",2013
"Synthesis, Thermal Behavior and Energy Performance of Nitroguanidyl-Functionalized Energetic Materials","Six nitroguanidyl-functionalized nitrogen-rich compounds were synthesized and characterized by EA, FTIR, and NMR. In addition, the crystal structures of ANPTz, CABNG, and FANG were further determined by X-ray singlecrystal diffractometer. The thermal decomposition behaviours were studied by the DSC-TG-FTIR-MS coupling technique and the results showed that all the compounds had good thermal stability, among which ANPTz had the best thermal stability (Td= 211.03 degrees C). Also, HCN, CO2, H2O, and NO2 were released during thermal decomposition process. The self-accelerating decomposition temperature (T-SADT) and thermal explosion critical temperature (T-b) were calculated to evaluate thermal safety, and the relative order was as follows: FANG (T-SADT= 198.68 degrees C, T-b= 209.97 degrees C)> ANPTz (T-SADT= 194.12 degrees C, Tb= 208.63 degrees C)> BANTz (T-SADT= 182.52 degrees C, T-b= 207.54 degrees C)> AANG (T-SADT= 180.04 degrees C, T-b= 188.35 degrees C)> CABNG (T-SADT= 176.80 degrees C, Tb= 187.32 degrees C)> MABNG (TSADT= 173.61 degrees C, Tb= 184.29 degrees C). The results indicated that FANG had the acceptable sensitivity (IS= 7.84 J), good detonation performance (D= 8551 m center dot s 1, P= 32.33 GPa), and the significant catalytic effect (the decomposition temperature of RDX decreased by 8.31 degrees C).",2021
"Al-Based Nano-Sized Composite Energetic Materials (Nano-CEMs): Preparation, Characterization, and Performance","As one of the new types of functional materials, nano-sized composite energetic materials (nano-CEMs) possess many advantages and broad application prospects in the research field of explosives and propellants. The recent progress in the preparation and performance characterization of Al-based nano-CEMs has been reviewed. The preparation methods and properties of Al-based nano-CEMs are emphatically analyzed. Special emphasis is focused on the improved performances of Al-based nano-CEMs, which are different from those of conventional micro-sized composite energetic materials (micro-CEMs), such as thermal decomposition and hazardous properties. The existing problems and challenges for the future work on Al-based nano-CEMs are discussed.",2020
Laser-shocked energetic materials with metal additives: evaluation of chemistry and detonation performance,"A focused, nanosecond-pulsed laser has been used to ablate, atomize, ionize, and excite milligram quantities of metal-doped energetic materials that undergo exothermic reactions in the laser-induced plasma. The subsequent shock wave expansion in the air above the sample has been monitored using high-speed schlieren imaging in a recently developed technique, laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM). The method enables the estimation of detonation velocities based on the measured laser-induced air-shock velocities and has previously been demonstrated for organic military explosives. Here, the LASEM technique has been extended to explosive formulations with metal additives. A comparison of the measured laser-induced air-shock velocities for TNT, RDX, DNTF, and LLM-172 doped with Al or B to the detonation velocities predicted by the thermochemical code CHEETAH for inert or active metal participation demonstrates that LASEM has potential for predicting the early time (< 10 mu s) participation of metal additives in detonation events. The LASEM results show that while Al is mostly inert at early times in the detonation event (confirmed from large-scale detonation testing), B is active-and reducing the amount of hydrogen present during the early chemical reactions increases the resulting estimated detonation velocities.",2017
Modelling detonation waves in condensed energetic materials: multiphase CJ conditions and multidimensional computations,"A hyperbolic multiphase flow model with a single pressure and a single velocity but several temperatures is proposed to deal with the detonation dynamics of condensed energetic materials. Temperature non-equilibrium effects are mandatory in order to deal with wave propagation (shocks, detonations) in heterogeneous mixtures. The model is obtained as the asymptotic limit of a total non-equilibrium multiphase flow model in the limit of stiff mechanical relaxation only (Kapila et al. in Phys Fluids 13:3002-3024, 2001). Special attention is given to mass transfer modelling, that is obtained on the basis of entropy production analysis in each phase and in the system (Saurel et al. in J Fluid Mech 607:313-350, 2008). With the help of the shock relations given in Saurel et al. (Shock Waves 16:209-232, 2007) the model is closed and provides a generalized ZND formulation for condensed energetic materials. In particular, generalized CJ conditions are obtained. They are based on a balance between the chemical reaction energy release and internal heat exchanges among phases. Moreover, the sound speed that appears at sonic surface corresponds to the one of Wood (A textbook of sound, G. Bell and Sons LTD, London, 1930) that presents a non-monotonic behaviour versus volume fraction. Therefore, non-conventional reaction zone structure is observed. When heat exchanges are absent, the conventional ZND model with conventional CJ conditions is recovered. When heat exchanges are involved interesting features are observed. The flow behaviour presents similarities with non ideal detonations (Wood and Kirkwood in J Chem Phys 22:1920-1924, 1950) and pathological detonations (Von Neuman in Theory of detonation waves, 1942; Guenoche et al. in AIAA Prog Astron Aeronaut 75: 387-407, 1981). It also present non-conventional behaviour with detonation velocity eventually greater than the CJ one. Multidimensional resolution of the corresponding model is then addressed. This poses serious difficulties related to the presence of material interfaces and shock propagation in multiphase mixtures. The first issue is solved by an extension of the method derived in Saurel et al. (J Comput Phys 228(5):1678-1712, 2009) in the presence of heat and mass transfers. The second issue poses the difficult mathematical question of numerical approximation of non-conservative systems in the presence of shocks associated to the physical question of energy partition among phases for a multiphase shock. A novel approach is used, based on extra evolution equations used to retain the information of the material initial state. This method insures convergence in the post-shock state. Thanks to these various theoretical and numerical ingredients, one-dimensional and multidimensional unsteady detonation waves computations are done, eventually in the presence of material interfaces. Convergence of the numerical hyperbolic solver against ZND multiphase solution is reached. Material interfaces, shocks, detonations are solved with a unified formulation where the same equations are solved everywhere with the same numerical scheme.",2009
"Bis(nitroamino-1,2,4-triazolates): ","Modern energetic motifs for military and civilian applications are most often evaluated using various criteria, for example, energetic properties, production costs, and safety issues. Given this background, the design of energetic materials requires a deep understanding of both detonation performance and molecular stability. Here a new family of energetic bis(nitroamino-1,2,4-triazolates), which exhibit good thermal stabilities, excellent detonation properties, and low sensitivities, has been designed. Furthermore, two hydroxylammonium bis(azolates) with pyrazole and tetrazole backbones were synthesized, and they exhibit energetic properties analogous to the triazoles. This work highlights the application potential of N-bridged bis(azolates) as promising energetic materials.",2014
Investigating Energetic and Impedance Relations of Microwave Transmission Line Filled with Dielectric Material,"During microwave treatment, microwave energy is transferred to a material sample placed in an applicator of given geometric parameters. As a result of the energy transfer, the sample absorbs energy from the microwave field depending on its dielectric properties. The degree of energy absorption is directly proportional to the dielectric loss and proportional to the square root of the dielectric constant. The temperature of the sample continuously increases due to the energy transfer and the dielectric properties of the sample also change with the rising temperature. Although the microwave energy supply is constant, time and temperature dependent energy impedance and dielectric relations are developed. A part of them is measurable, but the other part of them can not be directly measured, they can only be computed from the previously measured ones. In a closed model which contains the parameters of the sample and the waveguide, the continuously changing parameters can be determined in relation of the temperature. These parameters are as follows: Attenuation of the transmission line, temporal change of the sample temperature, dielectric properties of the sample, loss factor of the sample, penetration depth, impedance of the transmission line, standing wave ratio reflection factor. The above parameters can be modeled as a function of the sample's temperature or as a function of time.",2010
Initial mechanisms for the unimolecular decomposition of electronically excited bisfuroxan based energetic materials,"Unimolecular decomposition of energetic molecules, 3,3-diamino-4,4'-bisfuroxan (labeled as A) and 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-bisfuroxan (labeled as B), has been explored via 226/236 nm single photon laser excitation/decomposition. These two energetic molecules, subsequent to UV excitation, create NO as an initial decomposition product at the nanosecond excitation energies (5.0-5.5 eV) with warm vibrational temperature (1170 +/- 50 K for A, 1400 +/- 50 K for B) and cold rotational temperature (< 55 K). Initial decomposition mechanisms for these two electronically excited, isolated molecules are explored at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF(12,12)/6-31G(d)) level with and without MP2 correction. Potential energy surface calculations illustrate that conical intersections play an essential role in the calculated decomposition mechanisms. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, NO product is released through opening of the furoxan ring: ring opening can occur either on the S-1 excited or S-0 ground electronic state. The reaction path with the lowest energetic barrier is that for which the furoxan ring opens on the S1 state via the breaking of the N1-O1 bond. Subsequently, the molecule moves to the ground S0 state through related ring-opening conical intersections, and an NO product is formed on the ground state surface with little rotational excitation at the last NO dissociation step. For the ground state ring opening decomposition mechanism, the N-O bond and C-N bond break together in order to generate dissociated NO. With the MP2 correction for the CASSCF(12,12) surface, the potential energies of molecules with dissociated NO product are in the range from 2.04 to 3.14 eV, close to the theoretical result for the density functional theory (B3LYP) and MP2 methods. The CASMP2(12,12) corrected approach is essential in order to obtain a reasonable potential energy surface that corresponds to the observed decomposition behavior of these molecules. Apparently, highly excited states are essential for an accurate representation of the kinetics and dynamics of excited state decomposition of both of these bisfuroxan energetic molecules. The experimental vibrational temperatures of NO products of A and B are about 800-1000 K lower than previously studied energetic molecules with NO as a decomposition product.

Multiscale modelling on the shock-induced chemical reactions of multifunctional energetic structural materials,"Multifunctional energetic structural materials (MESMs) are usually granular mixtures, which release energy due to exothermic chemical reaction initiated under shock loading conditions. The mesostructure, in terms of the size, shape, and distribution of granular mixture, plays a significant role in chemical reaction and the energy release characteristics of MESMs. However, it is difficult to model such a complex process involving thermal-mechanical-chemical responses, especially the effects of the initial mesostructures. In this paper, a multiscale modelling approach is proposed to simulate the chemical reaction of MESMs under a shock compression. The thermal-mechanical response of MESMs is first obtained from mesoscale simulations. Then, the macroscale thermochemical model for a shock-induced chemical reaction is given, in which the extent of reaction is considered. Finally, the spatial profiles of temperature and pressure from the mesoscale heterogeneous simulation are homogenized into cells as an initial state for chemical reaction and further combined with the thermochemical model in macroscale. Hence this provides insight into thermal-mechanical-chemical responses based on the initial mesostructures. Aluminum/Tungsten/Polytetrafluoroethylene granular mixture is selected to demonstrate the method and the effects of volume fraction and impact velocity on the shock-induced chemical reaction. The multiscale approach developed, which combines the mesoscale simulation and macroscale thermochemical modelling, can be used to predict the shock-induced chemical reaction of MESMs with different mesoscale characteristics over a wide range of impact velocities.

Energetic Ionic Materials: How Green Are They? A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment Study,"Recently, several energetic ionic salts and liquids have been proposed as novel high-energy materials, propellants, and explosives. The life cycle environmental impacts of these new energetic salts have not been previously studied. Environmental impacts arise both from release of these energetic materials themselves as well as from their synthesis. In this work, for the first time, we report the results of cradle-to-gate life cycle environmental impacts of production of energetic ionic salt 1,2,3-triazolium nitrate and compare it with traditional energetic material 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The results indicate that the production processes of ionic salt have a significantly higher environmental footprint than conventional energetic materials. The above result was consistent across all nine impact categories analyzed and can be directly attributed to energy intensive steps needed to prepare the ionic salt and its precursors. The findings suggest that ionic energetic materials have higher environmental impact than TNT from a life cycle perspective.",2013
Structural and Thermal Characterization of A Novel High Nitrogen Energetic Material: (NH4)2DNMT,"1,4-Dihydro-5H-(dinitromethylene)-tetrazole ammonium salt ((NH4)2DNMT), a high nitrogen energetic compound, was synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal behavior of (NH4)2DNMT was studied with DSC and TG-DTG methods. The kinetic equation of the thermal decomposition reaction is: da/dT=1013.17/3 beta(1-a)-2 exp(-1.388x105/RT). The critical temperature of thermal explosion is 182.7?degrees C. The specific heat capacity of (NH4)2DNMT was determined and the molar heat capacity is 301 J?mol-1?K-1 at 298.15 K. The adiabatic time-to-explosion of (NH4)2DNMT was calculated to be 277 s. The detonation velocity and detonation pressure were also estimated. All results showed that (NH4)2DNMT presents good performance.",2012
Decomposition of Energetic Materials by Pulsed Electrical Discharges in Gas-Bubbled Aqueous Solutions,"The application of high-voltage pulsed electrical discharges in bubbled water (PDBWs) for the remediation of solutions containing energetic compounds such as RDX, HMX, and TNT was investigated. Using low-energy pulses (similar to 300 mJ/pulse), it was found that the PDBW was highly selective toward the type of energetic compound. The effects of a catalyst and of the pH value of the solution on the degradation of energetic compounds were also studied. HMX decomposition is most effective when the PDBW is used at low pH under Fenton reaction conditions. The degradation efficiency was higher for oxygen (O-2) than for argon (Ar) as the bubbled gas.",2009
Solubility Determination and Comprehensive Analysis of the New Heat-Resistant Energetic Material TNBP,"To improve the crystal quality of 4,8-bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)difurazolo [3,4-b:3',4'-e] pyrazine (TNBP), the solubility of TNBP in organic solvents (six pure and four mixed solvents) was determined by the laser monitoring technique from 293.15 to 353.15 K. The results showed that the solubility was positively correlated with the increase in the experimental temperature and the main solvent content, except for the co-solvent phenomenon in the DMSO + ethyl acetate solvent mixture. To explain the dissolution behavior of TNBP, the KAT-SER model was analyzed for pure solvent systems, and it was found that hydrogen bonding alkalinity and self-cohesiveness were the main influencing factors. The free energy of solvation and radial distribution function of TNBP in mixed solvents were also obtained by molecular dynamics simulation, and the effect of solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions on the solubility trend was analyzed. The experimental data were correlated using three empirical equations (van't Hoff equation, modified Apelblat equation, and ?h equation), and the deviation analysis showed the good applicability of the modified Apelblat model. Furthermore, the dissolution of TNBP was heat-absorbing and not spontaneous, according to the thermodynamic characteristics estimated by the van't Hoff equation.",2023
Combustion waves in narrow samples of solid energetic material: Chaotic versus spinning dynamics,"In this work, we study the conditions determining the appearance of chaotic or spinning dynamic regimes for flames propagating in narrow cylindrical samples of energetic materials. Two models for heat losses from the sample surface are explored. The first model allows for a linear dependence of heat-loss intensity on the surface temperature. Another model assumes radiative heat losses modeled by the fourth degree of temperature. The global stability analysis of steady-state solutions is carried out for both models. It is shown that the main factor determining the wave dynamics is the sample thickness. In sufficiently thin samples, the axisymmetric instability mode prevails and the flame dynamics depends on the intensity of heat-losses. With an increase in their intensity, the auto-oscillatory dynamics first transforms into chaotic through the period doubling Feigenbaum's cascade and, with a further increase in heat-losses, the dynamical extinction occurs. However if the sample is sufficiently thick, the most unstable mode is the mode with a nonzero azimuthal wave number. In this case, the spinning propagation regime is finally realized with a multi-headed flame structure formed. It is found that, qualitatively, this scenario is independent of the specifics of the heat-loss model. (c) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2021
Deciphering Solvent Effect on Crystal Growth of Energetic Materials for Accurate Morphology Prediction,"A new strategy for the accurate morphology prediction of energetic material crystals was proposed in the theoretical framework of the attachment energy model; namely, the ""averaged"" attachment energies are replaced by the binding energies at the adsorption sites that were found by computational simulations to be the crucial factor to determine the crystal growth rate.",2020
New Energetic Materials: Functionalized 1-Ethyl-5-aminotetrazoles and 1-Ethyl-5-nitriminotetrazoles,"Alkylation of 5-aminotetrazole (1) with 2-chloroethanol leads to a mixture of the N-1 and N-2 isomers of (2-hydroxyethyl)-5-aminotetrazole. Treatment of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-aminotetrazole (2) with SOCl2 yielded 1-(2-chlorethyl)-5-aminotetrazole (3). 1(2-Azidoethyl)-5-aminotetrazole (4) was generated by the reaction of 3 with sodium azide. Nitration of 2, 3, and 4 with HNO3 (100%) yielded in the case of 2 and 3 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazole (5) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazole (6). In the case of 4, 1-(2-nitratoethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazole monohydrate (7) was obtained. 1-(2-Azidoethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazole (8) Could be obtained by nitration of 4 with NO2BF4 Via the formation of potassium 1-(2-azidoethyl)-5-nitrimiotetrazolate (9). The reaction of 6 with NaN3 resulted in the formation of the salt sodium 1-(2-chloroethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazolate (10a). The deprotonation reaction of 6 was further investigated by the formation of the ammonium salt (10b). The protonation of 2 and 4 with dilute nitric acid led to 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-aminotetrazolium nitrate (it) and 1-(2-azidoethyl)-5-aminotetrazolium nitrate (12), respectively. Similarly, protonation of 4 with perchloric acid led to 1-(2-azidoethyl)-5-aminotetrazolium perchlorate monohydrate (13). Since 5-nitrimino-tetrazoles can be used as bidentate ligands, the coordination abilities of 5, 6, and 8 were tested by the reaction with copper nitrate trihydrate, yielding the copper complexes trans-[diaquabis{1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazolato-kappa(2) N-4,O-5}copper(II)] (14), trans-[diaquabis{1-(2-chloroethyl)5-nitriminotetrazolato-kappa N-2(4),O-5}copper(II)] dihydrate (15), and [diaquabis{1-(2-azidoethyl)-5-nitriminotetrazolato-kappa N-2(4), O-5}copper(II)] (16). All compounds were characterized by low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, comprehensive characterization (IR, Raman, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (H-1, C-13), elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, DSC) was performed. The heats of formation of selected compounds were computed by using heats of combustion obtained by bomb calorimetry or calculated by the atomization method. With these values and the densities determined from X-ray crystallography, several detonation parameter were calculated by the EXPLO5 program. Finally, the sensitivities towards impact and friction were determined using a BAM drop hammer and friction tester.",2009
Interaction-Enhanced Coating of Energetic Material: A Generally Applicable Method for the Desensitization,"Inspired by the better desensitizing effect introduced by enhanced interaction, ammonium formate (Am) was utilized to modify graphene oxide (GO) and the functional graphene oxide (Am-GO) was obtained in this work, which was endowed with more amino groups and completely positive charge. Due to the modification and corresponding enhanced interaction, the impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity of HMX/Am-GO can be desensitized to 40 J and 192 N, respectively. To further desensitize the friction sensitivity, graphite (G) was utilized to replace part of Am-GO. And HMX/Am-GO/G was endowed with 40 J and 360 N of impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity respectively, which is the best desensitizing effect of HMX to our best knowledge. Furthermore, CL-20 and DNTF were coated by the same coating, which also can be desensitized with the best effect. In addition, because the coating process is performed in water at room temperature, this desensitization is environment-friendly and benefit for the large scale of production. This work demonstrates the improved desensitizing effect with enhanced interaction and provides a potential general applicable method for desensitization.",2022
Boosting the performance of energetic materials through thermally-induced conformational transition,"In this study, the desirable U-conformations of 3,3'-bis.1Htetrazol- 5-yl)-4,4'-azofurazan (DTAZF) were prepared through thermally-induced conformational transition from S-DTAZF crystals, as confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. U-DTAZF exhibited increases of 0.05 g cm -3 (2.9%), 106 kJ mol -1 (9.4%), 275 m s -1 (3.7%) and 2.2 GPa (8.9%) in density, heat of formation, detonation velocity and detonation pressure, respectively, compared to those of S-DTAZF; meanwhile, it showed comparable sensitivities toward impact and friction and an acceptable decrease in thermal stability.

Enhanced energy delivery of direct-write fabricated reactive materials with energetic graphene oxide,"Aluminum (Al) based reactive materials are of interest as their addition can significantly increase the energy density of energetic composites such as solid propellants. In this study, we employed graphene oxide (GO) as an energetic gas generator to increase the ignitability of Al and promote the flame propagation of Al/CuO thermite composites. Compared to the pristine Al/CuO composite, 2.5 wt % addition of GO releases gas and heat upon disproportionation, resulting in a 2X higher burn rate and heat flux. Though both GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) addition can reduce the agglomeration size of Al NPs by 2X, GO is more energetic with heat and gas release at low temperature, granting it the ability to increase the ignitability of Al NPs and promote the energy delivery of Al/CuO composite. This study provides a simple way to increase the energy delivery rate of reactive materials by adding a small percentage of functionalized carbon nanomaterials.",2024
"5,6-Biheterocyclic pentazolate salts as promising energetic materials: a new design strategy","Pentazole (cyclo-N5-) energetic salts have always been of high research value in the energetic materials field. However, the low density of the available cyclo-N5- salt seriously affects its comprehensive performance. Therefore, it is of great significance to effectively design and screen out pentazole salts with excellent properties. In this work, a cation design strategy based on a 5,6-biheterocycle is proposed. Based on the predicted density, heat of formation and detonation properties, the nitrogen-rich bicyclic heterocycle with -N-O- bond and-NO2 or-NHNO2 substituent as a cation is an effective method to improve the comprehensive properties of cyclo-N5- salts, and four salts of F2, G2, H2 and H7 with superior comprehensive properties to RDX were selected. Monte Carlo method was used to predict the stable crystal structure of four salts. Atoms in molecules theory (AIM) was used to expound the contribution of hydrogen bond and 7C-7C superposition to the stability of cyclo-N5-. The cohesive energy density and mechanical properties show that the thermal stability of H2 (with best detonation perfor-mance of D: 9.16 km s-1, P: 38.52 GPa) is similar to 3,6,7-triamino-7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazol-2-ium pentazolate (decomposition temperature: 394.1 K, impact sensitivity: greater than 40 J). First-principles mo-lecular dynamics simulation for H2 thermal decomposition was performed to explore the underlying mechanism of its excellent detonation performance. This work is expected to provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of cyclo-N5- salts.",2022
The effect of crystal orientation on shock loading of single crystal energetic materials,"Void collapse under shock loading has become a model problem to study the nucleation of hot spots in high energy density materials. While experimental observation of this phenomenon remains elusive, simulations can help identify the relevant physical mechanisms for heat generation and criticality. A finite element method approach to simulate shock waves that includes crystal plasticity, with a power-law slip rate, hardening law and an equation of state is presented. Numerical simulations of shock loading of single crystal beta-HMX containing a cylindrical hole of diameter 10 mu m are performed with different orientations and impact velocities in 3D and under plane strain conditions. The elastoplastic response, including the temperature increase due to plastic dissipation, is strongly affected by the crystal orientation. Specifically, the ((1) over bar (1) over bar 1)-oriented crystal shows the highest temperature increase. These results can guide the design of experiments to investigate processes at the micrometer length scales in energetic materials.",2018
Energetic materials identification by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy combined with artificial neural network,"In this study, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a combination of the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis has been implemented for the identification of energetic materials, including TNT, RDX, black powder, and propellant. Also, aluminum, copper, inconel, and graphite have been used for more accurate investigation and comparison. After the LIBS test and spectrum acquisition on all samples in both air and argon ambient, optimized neural networks were designed by LIBS data. Based on input data, three ANN algorithms are proposed: the first is fed with the whole LIBS spectra in air (ANN1) and the second with the principle component analysis (PCA) scores of each spectrum in air (ANN2) and the other with the PCA scores of the spectrum in Ar (ANN3). According to the results, error of the network is very low in ANN2 and 3 and the best identification and discrimination was obtained by ANN3. After these, in order to validate and for more investigation of this combined method, we also used Al/RDX standard samples for analysis. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America",2017
Aluminum/copper oxide nanostructured energetic materials prepared by solution chemistry and electrophoretic deposition,"Nanostructured energetic materials benefit from improved spatial distribution and enhanced interfacial contact between reducing agents and oxidizing agents, and thus they have attracted increasing attention in the past decade. In this study Al/CuO nanostructured energetic materials were prepared by combining a solution chemistry method and electrophoretic deposition. A piece of clean Cu foil was first placed in a solution consisting of NaOH and (NH4) S2O8 to form a layer of copper hydroxide, which was then dehydrated in an oven at 180 degrees C for 4 h to obtain CuO nanostructures. Nano Al particles were integrated with the CuO nanostructures by electrophoretic deposition to form Al/CuO nanostructured energetic materials. Thermal analysis showed that the prepared nanostructured energetic materials had lower apparent activation energy than that of a randomly mixed counterpart thanks to the structural design.",2016
Azole energetic materials: Initial mechanisms for the energy release from electronical excited nitropyrazoles,"Decomposition of energetic material 3,4-dinitropyrazole (DNP) and two model molecules 4-nitropyrazole and 1-nitropyrazole is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The initial decomposition mechanisms for these three nitropyrazoles are explored with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from all three materials subsequent to UV excitation. Observed NO products are rotationally cold (<50 K) for all three systems. The vibrational temperature of the NO product from DNP is (3850 +/- 50) K, 1350 K hotter than that of the two model species. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF(12,8)/6-31+G(d) level illustrate that conical intersections plays an essential role in the decomposition mechanism. Electronically excited S-2 nitropyraozles can nonradiatively relax to lower electronic states through (S-2/S-1)(CI) and (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersection and undergo a nitro-nitrite isomerization to generate NO product either in the S-1 state or S-0 state. In model systems, NO is generated in the S-1 state, while in the energetic material DNP, NO is produced on the ground state surface, as the S-1 decomposition pathway is energetically unavailable. The theoretically predicted mechanism is consistent with the experimental results, as DNP decomposes in a lower electronic state than do the model systems and thus the vibrational energy in the NO product from DNP should be hotter than from the model systems. The observed rotational energy distributions for NO are consistent with the final structures of the respective transition states for each molecule. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",2014
Experimental and theoretical studies on the decomposition mechanisms of geminal dinitro energetic materials,"These studies combine crossed laser-molecular beam scattering, velocity map imaging and computation to study the thermal decomposition mechanisms of geminal dinitro energetic materials. In our experimental studies, we photolytically generate two key intermediates in the decomposition of such energetic materials, 2-nitro-2-propyl radical and 2-nitropropene by photodissociating 2-bromo-2-nitropropane at 193 nm. These intermediates were produced at high internal energies and access a number of competing unimolecular dissociation channels. The scattering and imaging experiments provided evidence for four photodissociation pathways of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane along with a total of twelve subsequent dissociations of the resulting intermediate. In addition to the experimental studies, extensive calculations were conducted at the G4//B3LYP/6-311++g(3df,2p) level to compute the energetics of these dissociation events. Interestingly, a novel transition state (TS) for NO loss was discovered for the 2-nitro-2-propyl radical, which has a reaction barrier substantially lower than a traditional nitro-nitrite isomerization mechanism would suggest. This pathway is only available to nitroalkyl radicals and is extremely exothermic. To confirm the presence of this novel TS in a real-world system, the potential energy surface (PES) of a new energetic material, 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7), was calculated. This PES confirms the presence of the novel NO loss TS in FOX-7; this new TS allows for a low energy pathway to the production of NO in the unimolecular decomposition of FOX-7. In addition, these calculations demonstrate that initial loss of NO is competitive with simple C-N bond fission in unsaturated energetic materials. This low barrier and high exothermicity may be responsible for the extensive NO production and energy release observed in energetic materials with geminal dinitro groups.",2014
Effect of energetic ions on plasma damage of porous SiCOH low-,"Plasma damage of SiCOH low-k films in an oxygen plasma is studied using a transformer coupled plasma reactor. The concentration of oxygen atoms and O-2(+) ions is varied by using three different conditions: (1) bottom power only, (2) bottom and top power, and (3) top power only. After plasma exposure, the low-k samples are characterized by various experimental techniques. It is shown that the ion bombardment induced by the bottom power minimizes the plasma damage by increasing the recombination coefficient of oxygen radicals. Contrary to the expectations, the densification of the top surface by ion radiation was limited. The increase in the recombination coefficient is mainly provided by modification of the pore wall surface and creation of chemically active sites stimulating the recombination of oxygen atoms. The results show that a reduction in plasma damage can be achieved without sealing of low-k top surface. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society. [DOI: 10.1116/1.3372838]",2010
Unreacted equation of states of typical energetic materials under static compression: A review,"The unreacted equation of state (EOS) of energetic materials is an important thermodynamic relationship to characterize their high pressure behaviors and has practical importance. The previous experimental and theoretical works on the equati on of state of several energetic materials including nitromethane, 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane (HMX), hexanitrostilbene (HNS), hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW or CL-20), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), triamino-trinitrobenzene (TATB), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (DADNE or FOX-7), and trinitrotoluene (TNT) are reviewed in this paper. The EOS determined from hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic compressions are discussed and compared. The theoretical results based on ab initio calculations are summarized and compared with the experimental data.",2016
Quantifying the Transport of Energetic Materials in Unsaturated Sediments from Cracked Unexploded Ordnance,"Dissolved explosive species have been found in the groundwater under military training areas. These explosives are thought to originate from munitions although the mechanism of transport to the groundwater is poorly understood. This study was conducted to determine whether ruptured unexploded ordnance may be a viable source term for these explosives. The rupturing effect of one 81 mm-mortar exploding in close proximity to another 81-mm mortar was observed and the resulting contaminants were collected. These contaminants were then subjected to leaching experiments on repacked, jack drill compacted unsaturated sediment columns in a climate controlled laboratory. The mortars which were exposed to nearby explosions were shown to be susceptible to rupturing rather than sympathetically detonating under certain conditions. The ruptured mortars released LIP to 166 +/- 2 g of pulverized explosive residues (largely Composition B) and the results from the subsequent leaching tests showed that this explosive residue is highly mobile in unsaturated sandy soil. Up to 4.45 +/- 1.00 g of dissolved explosive contamination was transported through the unsaturated soil columns during the first year of infiltration. The results indicate the mass of transported explosive residue dissolved in the leachate was primarily caused by the preferential dissolution of explosive contaminants having a grain size under 0.125 mm. Surface or near-surface unexploded ordnance (UXO) on live fire ranges may therefore be significant sources of explosive environmental contamination after they have been exposed to other rounds which explode nearby.",2009
Microstructure and reactivity of cryomilled Al-Ni energetic material with nanoscale lamellar structure,"An Al-Ni alloy system with excellent energy density and mechanical performance is regarded as a novel high-energy-density material to enhance the energy emission of explosives or propellants. In this study, we explored the influence of a process control agent (PCA) varying from 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, to 1.0 (wt.%) on the cryomilling of Al and Ni powder mixtures. The structural and morphological evolution of cryomilled Al-Ni powder was determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, particle size distribution analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Differential thermal analysis was used to study the exothermic reaction temperature, and activation energy calculations were performed using Kissinger plots. The results indicated that the addition of PCA changed the Al-Ni aggregate shape from oval to granular. The lamellar size also became finer after adding PCA up to 0.25 wt.% but the lamellar shape changed to granular at 1 wt.% PCA. These nanoscale lamellae serve as nuclei to produce Al-Ni reaction compounds, which gradually decrease the activation energy. The optimal concentration of PCA was determined to be 0.25 wt.% as this concentration decreased the activation energy of the Al-Ni alloy because of the fine, homogeneous, and alternate Al-Ni lamellae in the alloy when cryomilled.",2022
The Many Faces of FOX-7: A Precursor to High-Performance Energetic Materials,"New derivatives of 1,1-diamino-2, 2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) are reported. These highly oxygen- and nitrogen-rich compounds were fully characterized using IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray structure determination of (E)-1,2-bis{(E)-2-chloro-1-(chloroimino)-2,2-dinitroethyl}diazene) (10), N1, N2-dichloro-1, 2-diazenedicarboximidamide (11), and (E,E)-N,N-1,2-ethanediylidenebis(2, 2-dinitro-2-chloro-ethanamine) (12) was helpful in their characterization. Heats of formation (HOF) were calculated (Gaussian03) and combined with experimental densities to estimate the detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) of the high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) (EXPLO5, v6.01). The compounds exhibit good thermal stability, high density, positive HOF, acceptable oxygen balances, and excellent detonation properties, which often are superior to that of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX).",2015
Anisotropic constitutive model and numerical simulations for crystalline energetic material under shock loading,"A dynamic crystal plasticity model for a low-symmetric beta-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine single crystal with only limited operative slip systems has been developed, accounting for nonlinear elasticity, volumetric coupling with deviatoric behavior and thermo-dynamical consistence. Based on the decomposition of the stress tensor, a modified equation of state for anisotropic materials is employed. Simulations of the planar impact on the beta-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine single crystal show good agreement with existing particle velocity data in the case of (110) and (011). Pressure snapshots, the dislocation density, the shear stress and the strain localization for beta-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine single crystal under shocked loading are discussed. The present model provides more insights into a range of complex, orientation-dependent elastic and inelastic behaviors in shocked explosive crystals than isotropic elastic-plastic constitutive descriptions. The proposed formulation and algorithms can also be applied to study other low-symmetric crystals under high-pressure shocked loading that deform mainly by crystallographic slip.",2014
Two dimensional numerical prediction of deflagration-to-detonation transition in porous energetic materials,"This paper describes a two-dimensional code developed for analyzing two-phase deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) phenomenon in granular, energetic, solid, explosive ingredients. The two-dimensional model is constructed in full two-phase, and based on a highly coupled system of partial differential equations involving basic flow conservation equations and some constitutive relations borrowed from some one-dimensional studies that appeared in open literature. The whole system is solved using an optimized high-order accurate, explicit, central-difference scheme with selective-filtering/shock capturing (SF-SC) technique, to augment central-diffencing and prevent excessive dispersion. The sources of the equations describing particle-gas interactions in terms of momentum and energy transfers make the equation system quite stiff, and hence its explicit integration difficult. To ease the difficulties, a time-split approach is used allowing higher time steps. In the paper, the physical model for the sources of the equation system is given for a typical explosive, and several numerical calculations are carried out to assess the developed code. Microscale intergranular and/or intragranular effects including pore collapse, sublimation, pyrolysis, etc. are not taken into account for ignition and growth, and a basic temperature switch is applied in calculations to control ignition in the explosive domain. Results for one-dimensional DDT phenomenon are in good agreement with experimental and computational results available in literature. A typical shaped-charge wave-shaper case study is also performed to test the two-dimensional features of the code and it is observed that results are in good agreement with those of commercial software.

Estimation of the energetic nonhomogeneity of the surface of oxide and carbon materials,"The molecular statistical method for evaluating the distribution of active sites of various adsorbents relative to their energies has been improved. This method is used not only for the treatment of experimental data on the adsorption of hydrocarbons on various adsorbents, which is the usual procedure, but also data on the adsorption of polar water and methanol molecules on the active sites of adsorbent surfaces. Two types of active sites differing in energy have been shown to exist on the surface of graphitized carbon black, the complex shungite carbon/mineral adsorbent, and modified Silochrom. Chromatographic, calorimetric, and structural adsorption data were used to establish the relationship between the observed maxima of the energy distribution function of the adsorption sites with concrete adsorption sites or pores of the surface, on which the molecules are adsorbed.",2008
Thermal behavior and combustion mechanism of high-nitrogen energetic materials DHT and BTATz,"The thermal stability of 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DHT) and 3,6-bis(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5ylimino)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (BTATz) have been examined by isothermal and nonisothermal methods. The research conducted allow considering that the first stage of DHT decomposition is an unique, from viewpoint of thermal decomposition, redox process, in which tetrazine ring is reduced by hydrazine group forming diaminodihydrotetrazine and molecular nitrogen. In the case of BTATz, the decomposition begins with less thermostable tetrazole fragments, which captures the tetrazine ring also. The presence of preliminary reactions of isomerization during tetrazole ring decomposition is the reason for the large observable activation energy of decomposition (240.6 kJ/mol or 57.5 kcal/mol) in the temperature interval 250-334 degrees C. In the combustion wave at higher temperatures, the activation energy of BTATz decomposition has considerably lower value (128.4 kJ/mol or 30.7 kcal/mol), which is close to theoretically calculated one. Burning characteristics of DHT and BTATz have been investigated. The temperature distribution in the combustion waves of DHT and BTATz have been measured at low pressures, which allows obtaining the surface temperature dependence vs. pressure. The research conducted allow considering that the burning of investigated compounds controls by a combustion model with leading reaction in the condensed phase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A test to measure long-term high-temperature thermal stability of energetic materials,"We have developed an inexpensive, mercury-free manometric thermal stability test for explosives. The test is especially effective for high-temperature long-duration studies. It overcomes the limitations of the military-standard vacuum thermal stability (VTS) test that can only measure up to 11 cm(3)/g gassing, is temperature limited, bulky, fragile and uses mercury. In contrast, our ampule thermal stability test can measure up to 300 cm(3)/g gassing at temperatures up to 350 degrees C. We routinely run tests for 2 to 2,000 hours. The small size of the test equipment coupled with the ability to store heat-treated ampules for an extended period of time before they are broken and the internal pressure measured, makes it convenient to run a large number of tests simultaneously.",2010
Computational Investigation of Energetic Materials: Influence of Intramolecular and Intermolecular Interactions on Sensitivity,"The development of novel high energy density materials (HEDMs) with superior energetic properties depends on characterizing how and why detonation occurs. Detonation is highly energetic and a nearly instantaneous process, making experimental studies challenging; thus, computational modeling through density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) can be used to propose weakened, or activated, bonds that break to initiate explosive decomposition, termed trigger bonds. Bond activation is characterized by the Wiberg bond index (WBI), a measure of interatomic electron density. Trigger bonds in HEDMs are commonly found in explosophores, functional groups that contribute to energetic potential such as X-NO 2 (X=N,C,O) and N-N 2 linkages. Comparison of WBIs of potential trigger bonds to the same bond type in reference molecules provides a relative scale for bond activation (%ΔWBIs) which could be used to screen novel HEDMs for trigger bonds and potentially guide development of new materials. %ΔWBIs of nitroaromatic energetic materials indicate that intramolecular hydrogen bonding deactivates C-NO 2 bonds through resonance, while steric effects activate trigger bonds by increasing C-NO 2 dihedral angles. In aromatic azide-based and azole-based energetic materials, %ΔWBIs and activation energies predict that that the N-N 2 bond of the azide and N-NO 2 are more activated than C-NO 2 . An ortho nitro group to an azide yields a lower activation energy for N 2 extrusion from the azide. Thus, %ΔWBIs only provide a clue into the influence of intramolecular interactions on the sensitivity of trigger bonds. Detonation is unique to the solid state, making condensed-phase calculations necessary to characterize the effect of intermolecular interactions on trigger bond sensitivity. In models of ammonium nitrate, increased pressure compresses the unit cell and hydrogen bonding between ions becomes stronger. In molecular dynamics simulations at high pressure, hydrogen transfer from ammonium to nitrate producing ammonia and nitric acid, the initiation step for explosive decomposition, is observed around 40 GPa. These condensed-phase calculations can be extended to characterize the effect of pressure on intramolecular and intermolecular interactions to provide information that can be used to guide the synthesis of novel energetic materials.",2018
Synthesis and properties of 5-nitrotetrazole derivatives as new energetic materials,"An improved procedure for the synthesis of ammonium 5-nitrotetrazolate (3) is given here, which allows the preparation of the material on a large scale. 3 was selectively alkylated with bromoacetonitrile yielding 5-nitrotetrazol-2-ylacetonitrile (4). The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azide ion to 4 rendered 5-(5-nitrotetrazol-2-ylmethyl) tetrazole monohydrate (5a) after recrystallization from water, which was used to synthesize energetic salts with ammonium (6a), guanidinium (7) and aminoguanidinium (8) cations. The water of crystallization in the hydrated species 5a and 6a was conveniently removed under vacuum forming the anhydrous materials 5b and 6b. All compounds were characterized by analytical (elemental analysis and mass spectrometry) and spectroscopic methods (IR, Raman and NMR spectroscopy), and the crystal structures of 4 (orthorhombic, P2(1)2(1)2(1), rho = 1.747 g cm(-3)), 5a (monoclinic, P2(1), rho = 1.796 g cm(-3)), 6a (triclinic, P (1) over bar, rho = 1.594 g cm(-3)) and 8 (monoclinic, P2(1)/n, rho = 1.633 g cm(-3)) were determined by low temperature X-ray crystallography. Due to the interest in tetrazole derivatives as energetic materials, the sensitivities and energetic properties of all compounds were determined. The high detonation pressures (P) and velocities (D) of the materials (4: 29.5 GPa, 8356 m s(-1), 5a: 28.7 GPa, 8341 m s(-1), 5b: 30.2 GPa, 8688 m s(-1), 6a: 21.3 GPa, 7658 m s(-1), 6b: 22.8 GPa, 7861 m s(-1), 7: 24.3 GPa, 8066 m s(-1) and 8: 25.0 GPa, 8202 m s(-1)) make them interesting candidates to find application as environmentally friendly nitrogen-rich energetic materials.",2009
Improved prediction of heats of formation of energetic materials using quantum mechanical calculations.,"We present simple atom and group-equivalent methods that will convert quantum mechanical energies of molecules to gas phase heats of formation of CHNO systems. In addition, we predict heats of sublimation and vaporization derived from information obtained from the quantum-mechanically calculated electrostatic potential of each isolated molecule. The heats of sublimation and vaporization are combined with the aforementioned gas phase heats of formation to produce completely predicted condensed phase heats of formation. These semiempirical computational methods, calibrated using experimental information, were applied to a series of CHNO molecules for which no experimental information was used in the development of the methods. These methods improve upon an earlier effort of Rice et al. [Rice, B. M.; Pai, S. V.; Hare, J. Combust. Flame 1999, 118, 445] through the use of a larger basis set and the application of group equivalents. The root-mean-square deviation (rms) from experiment for the predicted group-equivalent gas phase heats of formation is 3.2 kcal/mol with a maximum deviation of 6.5 kcal/mol. The rms and maximum deviation of the predicted liquid heats of formation are 3.2 and 7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, the rms and maximum deviation of predicted solid heats of formation are 5.6 and 12.2 kcal/mol, respectively, an improvement in the rms of approximately 40% compared to the earlier Rice et al. predictions using atom equivalents and a smaller basis set (B3LYP/6-31G*).",n-26
Structural Energetic Properties of Al/PVDF Composite Materials Prepared Using Fused Filament Fabrication,"The constituents of an aluminum/polyvinylidene fluoride multifunctional energetic structural material (MESM) were varied in order to determine the effect of solids loading and particle size on the structural energetic properties of the material. More specifically, seven different material formulations were paired with additive manufacturing to quantify key performance metrics relevant to the MESM use case. Determined via the quasi-static tensile testing of 3D printed dogbone samples, both the modulus of elasticity and the ultimate strength was found to be heavily dependent on the solids loading; respectively increasing from 71 MPa to 208 MPa and decreasing from 34.5 MPa to 21.6 MPa, when transitioning from a 10 % Al loading to a 50 % Al loading. To characterize the combustion properties, a thermochemical code was used to predict the heat of combustion and the adiabatic flame temperature for the formulations considered, showing a maximum predicted temperature near 20 % Al. Also, burning rate measurements were conducted on the 3D printed formulations in order to quantify their combustion performance. When burning in air, a maximum burning rate was found to occur at the slightly fuel-rich condition of 30 % Al. Upon completion of the characterization, the trade-off between mechanical performance and combustion performance was visualized by plotting critical MESM design parameters against one another.",2021
Additive Manufacturing of Viscous Materials: Development and Characterization of 3D Printed Energetic Structures,"The performance of solid rocket motors (SRMs) is extremely dependent on propellant formulation, operating pressure, and initial grain geometry. Traditionally, propellant grains are cast into molds, but it is difficult to remove the grains without damage if the geometry is too complex. Cracks or voids in propellant can lead to erratic burning that can break the grain apart and/or potentially overpressurize the motor. Not only is this dangerous, but the payload could be destroyed or lost. Some geometries (i.e. internal voids or intricate structures) cannot be cast and there is no consistent nor economical way to functionally grade grains made of multiple propellant formulations at fines scales (~ mm) without the risk of delamination between layers or the use of adhesives, which significantly lower performance. If one could manufacture grains in such a way, then one would have more control and flexibility over the design and performance of a SRM. However, new manufacturing techniques are required to enable innovation of new propellant grains and new analysis techniques are necessary to understand the driving forces behind the combustion of non-traditionally manufactured propellant. Additive manufacturing (AM) has been used in many industries to enable rapid prototyping and the construction of complex hierarchal structures. AM of propellant is an emerging research area, but it is still in its infancy since there are some large challenges to overcome. Namely, high performance propellant requires a minimum solids loading in order to combust properly and this translates into mixtures with high viscosities that are difficult to 3D print. In addition, it is important to be able to manufacture realistic propellant formulations into grains that do not deform and can be precisely functionally graded without the presence of defects from the printing process. The research presented in this dissertation identifies the effect of a specific AM process called Vibration Assisted Printing (VAP) on the combustion of propellant, as well as the development of binders that enable UV-curing to improve the final resolution of 3D printed structures. In addition, the combustion dynamics of additively manufactured layered propellant is studied with computational and experimental methods. The work presented in this dissertation lays the foundation for progress in the developing research area of additively manufactured energetic materials. The appendices of this dissertation presents some additional data that could also be useful for researchers. A more detailed description of the methods necessary to support the VAP process, additional viscosity measurements and micro-CT images of propellant, the combustion of Al/PVDF filament in windowed propellant at pressure, and microexplosions of propellant with an Al/Zr additive are all provided in this section.",2020
"Synthesis and Properties of Energetic Materials Based on 1,3-Diazocyclopentane","A family of biheterocyclic energetic materials based on 1,3-diazocyclopentane were synthesized and characterized by IR, NMR, MS, and elemental analysis. The crystal structures of compounds 8 and 9 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Heats of formation, detonation properties were calculated by isodesmic reactions and Kamlet-Jacobs equations, respectively. The safety parameters associated with impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity were also investigated. It is noteworthy that compounds 5 and 6 possess excellent detonation properties (detonation velocities were 8.89 and 8.66 km s(-1); detonation pressures were 35.8 and 32.7 GPa, respectively) and acceptable sensitivities (impact sensitivities were 10 and 13 J; friction sensitivities were 103 and 87 N, respectively). In addition, electronic properties (such as frontier molecular orbitals, electronic densities and electrostatic potentials) of compounds 5 and 6 were also simulated accurately to give an assessment of their physicochemical properties.",2019
Toward understanding the aging effect of energetic materials via advanced isoconversional decomposition kinetics,"The decomposition process of typical energetic material (EM) may consist of thousands of individual reactions as well as many intermediate species. However, one-step decomposition kinetics is routinely utilized for prediction of the shelf life of EMs. The inclusion of detailed multi-step chemistry in the kinetic mechanism can improve the reliability of the lifetime prediction. This study proposes a novel procedure for lifetime prediction of EMs, which adopts isoconversional kinetics to represent the decomposition reaction scheme. The pertinent EMs considered in the study include 97.5% cyclotrimethylene-trnitramine, 95% cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) and boron potassium nitrate. Differential scanning calorimetry was utilized for extracting the said isoconversional kinetics complemented by experimental validation of the proposed chemical kinetics through a comparison of the numerical lifetime predictions with accelerated aging experiment measurements.",2018

Fracturing Effect of Electrohydraulic Shock Waves Generated by Plasma-Ignited Energetic Materials Explosion,"Electrohydraulic shock waves (ESWs) are widely applied to many fields such as sterilization, lithotripsy, food processing, and so on. Based on high-pulsed power technology, electrical explosion is increasingly utilized to generate shock waves with steep fronts and short duration. In order to further magnify the shock waves, we have proposed a new technique by using energetic materials (EMs) loads. This paper investigated the fracturing effect of the ESWs generated by plasma-ignited EMs explosion. During the ESWs fracturing process, a large-scale triaxial stress pressurizing equipment and a dynamic strain measurement system were applied to the shale samples. The most evident experimental results showed that a large number of cell-shaped multiple cracks developed after the ESWs fracturing process. In addition, interior crack morphology and fluorescent tracing proved the evidence of penetration cracks. These cracks contributed to a great reduction of fracture pressure in fracturing test, which laid a scientific foundation for ESWs technique to be a promising method of well stimulation in those low permeability reservoir and further optimized into a new plugging relief and injection gain technology.",2017
Efficient Synthesis of Primary Nitrocarbamates of Sugar Alcohols: From Food to Energetic Materials,"The synthesis of various new polyvalent nitrocarbamates derived from sugar alcohols was accomplished by an economically benign two-step synthesis. The precursor carbamates were synthesized with the reagent chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (CSI) and further nitrated using mixed acid. The starting materials, sugar alcohols, are renewable biomass, mainly used in food and cosmetic industry. The structures of one carbamate and one nitrocarbamate were exemplary described by single-crystal X-ray-analysis. The heat of formation is calculated by the use of isodesmic reactions and the energetic performance data were estimated. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, H-1, C-13, and N-14/15 NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis (DSC). The nitrocarbamates exhibit good detonation performance and have significantly lower sensitivities compared to the commonly used nitrate ester explosive PETN.",2016
Dynamics of void collapse in shocked energetic materials: physics of void-void interactions,"This work presents the response of a porous energetic material subjected to severe transient loading conditions. The porosities, represented by voids, entirely change the response of an otherwise homogeneous material. The variations in terms of energy distribution and maximum temperature reached in the material in the presence of heterogeneities (voids) but in the absence of chemical reactions are studied. This study also accounts for void-void interactions to enhance the understanding of the localization of energy in the material. It is observed that relative position of voids can have important consequence on energy distribution as well as rise in temperature of the energetic material. The relative position of voids further influences the interaction of secondary shock waves generated during the collapse of one void with the downstream voids. This interaction can either enhance or diminish the strength of the shock depending on the location of downstream voids. This work also reveals that the findings from mutual void-void interactions can be used to study systems with multiple voids. This is shown by analyzing systems with 10-25 % void volume fraction. The effect of void-void interactions are connected to the overall response of a chemically inert porous material to imposed transient loads.",2013
A Novel Cellulose-Based Azide Energetic Material: 1-Azido-2-hydroxypropyl Cellulose Ether,"1-azido-2-hydroxypropyl cellulose ether, a novel potential energetic material, was prepared by reacting cellulose with glycidyl azide, which is synthesized from epihalohydrin via ring-opening and ring-closing reactions in the presence of diazoimide, under an alkaline condition, wherein a degree of substitution of the azido side chains as high as 0.5 and a nitrogen content of 10% (mass percentage) were achieved in the 1-azido-2-hydroxypropyl cellulose ether thus obtained. The structure and degree of substitution of the product were identified by characterizations such as elemental analysis, infrared absorption spectrum (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).",2011
The High-Pressure Characterization of Energetic Materials 2-Methyl-5-Nitramino-2,The isothermal structural properties equation of state and vibrational dynamics of 2MNT were studied under high pressure using synchrotron XRD and optical Raman and IR microspectroscopy Analysis of the XRD patterns revealed no indication of a phase transition to near 15 GPa and the pressure volume isotherm remained smooth to 15 GPa Near 15 GPa significant sample damage was observed from the X ray beam which precluded the acquisition of patterns above this pressure XRD and Raman spectroscopic measurements showed the monoclinic ambient condition phase of 2MNT remains the dominant phase to near 20 GPa although a shift of the NO2 IR active vibrational modes to lower frequencies suggested a subtle geometry modification not reflected in the XRD data,2010
Computational Evaluation of Polycyclic Bis-Oxadiazolo-Pyrazine Backbone in Designing Potential Energetic Materials,"4H,8H-bis[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b:3',4'-e]pyrazine (bis-oxadiazolo-pyrazine) represents a versatile CHNO backbone for the design of energetic materials. In this paper, we report a comprehensive computational study using density functional theory to improve detonation properties of this CHNO backbone by introducing pyrazine rings, nitro groups, and N-oxide functionalities. The heat of formation, oxygen balance, density, and detonation properties of a series of furazan-pyrazine fused ring derivatives are computed. Their sensitivity and stability has been correlated with bandgap (Delta ELUMO-HOMO), maximum heat of detonation (Q), and impact energy (h(50)). Introduction of -NO2 and N-oxide on the parent furazan-pyrazine fused ring derivatives is favorable for improving the heat of formation, oxygen balance and density. The heat of formation varies between 464.46 and 1043.57 kJ/mol, and the densities range from 1.75 to 2.01 g/cm(3). The positive heat of formation and high densities achieved good detonation velocities (6.74 to 9.61 km/s) and pressures (19.96-43.65 GPa). Among the bis-oxadiazolo-pyrazine derivatives, P5, P6, Q5, Q6, R4, R5, and R6 are fascinating due to their high detonation performances, have calculated detonation velocities and pressures above 9.30 km/s and 40.0 GPa, respectively. Some furazan-pyrazine fused ring derivatives reveal good performance parameters with reasonable stability, confirming them as potential energetic compounds relative to RDX and HMX.",2023
Preparation and characterization of RDX based composite energetic materials with a cellulose matrix,"Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX)-based high-energy explosives are widely used in weapon warheads, propellants, and ammunition. Many studies have explored different supporting structures for RDX; however, the use of natural materials have rarely has been reported. Natural cellulose is widely known for its excellent compatibility and loading capacity. In this study, cellulose was used as a supporting structure and insensitive material for RDX composites. Cellulose/RDX composite aerogels (RCAs) were prepared using 1-allyl-3-methyl imidazole (AMIMCl) as the solvent, and their properties were characterized. The results show that the content of nitrogen in cellulose/RCAs was 34.5%, and the content of RDX was as high as 94.3%. Moreover, RDX particles were attached to the fibers inside the cellulose aerogels (CAs), forming a homogeneous protective layer on the surface of the cellulose matrix. Compared with the raw RDX material, the thermal stability of the cellulose/RDX energetic aerogels was greatly increased. The porosity of the CAs was reduced due to RDX particles growing inside the CAs. The impact sensitivity increased from 35 to 78 cm.",2021
Size-matched hydrogen bonded hydroxylammonium frameworks for regulation of energetic materials,"Size matching molecular design utilizing host-guest chemistry is a general, promising strategy for seeking new functional materials. With the growing trend of multidisciplinary investigations, taming the metastable high-energy guest moiety in well-matched frameworks is a new pathway leading to innovative energetic materials. Presented is a selective encapsulation in hydrogen-bonded hydroxylammonium frameworks (HHF) by screening different sized nitrogen-rich azoles. The size-match between a sensitive high-energy guest and an HHF not only gives rise to higher energetic performance by dense packing, but also reinforces the layer-by-layer structure which can stabilize the resulting materials towards external mechanic stimuli. Preliminary assessment based on calculated detonation properties and mechanical sensitivity indicates that HHF competed well with the energetic performance and molecular stability (detonation velocity = 9286 m s(-1), impact sensitivity = 50 J). This work highlights the size-matched phenomenon of HHF and may serve as an alternative strategy for exploring next generation advanced energetic materials. Size matching molecular design utilizing host-guest chemistry is a general and promising strategy for seeking new functional materials. Here the authors screen different sized nitrogen rich azoles for selective encapsulation into a hydroxylammonium framework to achieve a dense packing and higher energetic performance.",2022
Electrophilic iodination: a gateway to high iodine compounds and energetic materials,"A large number of iodine atoms can be introduced into a single molecule in a one-pot reaction using trifluoroperacetic acid-mediated electrophilic iodination methodology. The scope of this reaction was investigated extensively using several pyrazole substrates which resulted in nine polyiodo pyrazole compounds with iodine content as high as 80%. This synthetic methodology was also utilized successfully for iodination of benzimidazoles. Tetraiodobenzimidazole was nitrated with 100% nitric acid to give a high yield of 4,5,6,7-tetranitro-1H-benzimidazol-2(3H)-one (14). All of these materials were fully characterized and compounds 5, 9, 10 and 14 were confirmed further with single crystal X-ray analysis. High density, positive oxygen balance, and very good impact sensitivity values characterize 14. For the first time, two 1,2,5-oxadiazole-N-oxide rings were introduced into a benzimidazole ring (11) which remarkably improves the stability of oxadiazole-N-oxide compounds.",2016
From FOX-7 to H-FOX to insensitive energetic materials with hypergolic properties,"Nitrogen/halogen rich derivatives, 3, 4, 8, and 9 of FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2- dinitroethene), and H-FOX (1-hydrazinyl-2,2-dinitroethenamine) have been synthesized, characterized and found to exhibit good energetic properties. Compound 4 displays hypergolic properties with commonly utilized fuels such as monomethyl hydrazine (MMH), and hydrazine hydrate (HH), as well as with ethylenediamine (EN), and 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) showing ignition delay times between 2.5 to 10 ms. Additionally, the hypergolic properties of 4 and 8 were further studied by using ammonia borane as a fuel solubilized in a green ionic liquid, 1-allyl-3-methyl imidazolium dicyanamide, (1 : 1 molar ratio). This is a new role for a derivative of H-FOX. The energetic and physical properties of all the molecules were either measured or calculated. All of materials were characterized by NMR, and infrared spectra, elemental analyses, and differential scanning calorimetry. Single crystal X-ray structural measurements for 4 and 9 were helpful in their confirmation.",2016
Energetic Effects of Substitution of La-Nd and Si-Ge Oxyapatite-Type Materials,"A series of lanthanide oxyapatites, neodymium silicates (Nd9.33-xM3x/2(SiO4)(6)O-2; x=0.0 and 2.0 and M=Ca, Sr, and Ba), and lanthanum germanate (La-10(GeO4)(6)O-3) were prepared by a variety of heat treatments and characterized. High-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry in molten 2PbO-B2O3 solvent at 1078K was performed to determine their enthalpies of formation from constituent oxides at room temperature. The energetics of these materials is discussed in terms of the effects of doping on two crystallographic sites, the lanthanide and tetrahedral sites. The enthalpy of formation from oxides becomes less exothermic by substituting La with Nd throughout the whole series, in both doped and undoped compositions, reflecting the smaller radius and lower basicity of Nd compared with La. Cation stoichiometric lanthanum germanate apatite (La-10(GeO4)(6)O-3) shows a more endothermic enthalpy of formation than the corresponding silicate, reflecting the larger radius and lower acidity of Ge than Si.",2013
Intramolecular integration of multiple heterocyclic skeletons for energetic materials with enhanced energy & safety,"The research for new generations of high explosives with the remarkable overall performance has always been a challenging task. Currently, the research priority of energetic materials is to explore new design strategies to balance and/or break the energy-safety limits. In this study, an intramolecular integration of various heterocyclic skeletons based on the unique superiority of each heterocycle was developed. By employing this approach, an advanced energetic molecule integrating 1,2,5-oxadiazole, 1,2,4-oxadiaozle and pyrazole skeletons, 5-(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(4-nitro-1,2,5 oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,2,4 oxadiazole (6), was designed and prepared. The energy level (e.g., detonation velocity: 9094 m s(-1)) of 6 is approaching that of the extensively used high explosive, RDX (8801 m s(-1)), while its safety (impact sensitivity: IS = 24 J; thermal stability: T-dec = 265 degrees C) are obviously superior to that of RDX (IS = 7.4 J; T-dec = 204 degrees C). These favorable energetic properties demonstrate the outstanding overall performance of 6. Moreover, the variation of sensitivities and thermal stabilities were further investigated through the quantum chemistry methods based on the single-crystal data. Our study is anticipated to attract more in-depth study on the promising intramolecular integration approach and accelerate the development of the advanced energetic materials.",2022
Pb Single Atoms Enable Unprecedented Catalytic Behavior for the Combustion of Energetic Materials,"Manipulating the thermal decomposition behavior of energetic materials is the key to further pushing the combustion performance of solid rocket propellants. Herein, atomically dispersed Pb single atoms on polydopamine (PDA-Pb) are demonstrated, which display unprecedented catalytic activity toward the thermal decomposition of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX). Impressively, RDX-based propellants with the addition of PDA-Pb catalyst exhibit substantially enhanced burning rates (14.98 mm s(-1) at 2 MPa), which is 4.8 times faster than that without PDA-Pb and represents the best catalytic performance among Pb-based catalysts. Moreover, it also possesses low-pressure exponents in broad pressure ranges, which can enable more stable and safer combustion in solid rocket engines. Theoretical calculation unravels the efficient catalytic activity is stemmed from the enhanced interfacial electronic coupling between RDX and PDA-Pb via orbital level engineering. More importantly, PDA-Pb also presents similar catalytic behavior toward the decomposition of nitrocellulose, suggesting its broad catalytic generality. This work can open up new opportunities in the field of energetic compound combustion by exploring Pb-based single atom catalysts and beyond.",2021
Prediction of Energetic Material Properties from Electronic Structure Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks,"We develop a convolutional neural network capable of directly parsing the 3D electronic structure of a molecule described by spatial point data for charge density and electrostatic potential represented as a 4D tensor. This method effectively bypasses the need to construct complex representations, or descriptors, of a molecule. This is beneficial because the accuracy of a machine learned model depends on the input representation. Ideally, input descriptors encode the essential physics and chemistry that influence the target property. Thousands of molecular descriptors have been proposed, and proper selection of features requires considerable domain expertise or exhaustive and careful statistical downselection. In contrast, deep learning networks are capable of learning rich data representations. This provides a compelling motivation to use deep learning networks to learn molecular structure-property relations from ""raw"" data. The convolutional neural network model is jointly trained on over 20,000 molecules that are potentially energetic materials (explosives) to predict dipole moment, total electronic energy, ChapmanJouguet (C-J) detonation velocity, C-J pressure, C-J temperature, crystal density, HOMO-LUMO gap, and solid phase heat of formation. This work demonstrates the first use of complete 3D electronic structure for machine learning of molecular properties.",2020
"Multipurpose Energetic Materials by Shuffling Nitro Groups on a 3,3′-Bipyrazole Moiety","A family of 3,3 '-bipyrazole-based energetic compounds having C-NO2/N-NO2 functionalities was synthesized by using various nitrating conditions. These nitro derivatives of bipyrazole are significantly more dense and energetic compared to the corresponding nitropyrazole analogues while maintaining the desired thermal stability and sensitivity. Depending on the number and nature of energetic nitro groups (C-NO2/N-NO2), different classes of energetic materials, such as green primary explosives, high-performance secondary explosives and heat-resistant explosives, were obtained. All the compounds were thoroughly characterized by IR, NMR [H-1, C-13{H-1}, N-15], elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Four were also structurally characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Heats of formation and detonation performance were calculated using Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, respectively.",2018
Energetic and exergetic analysis of a domestic water tank with phase change material,"Although water is a cheap and effective medium for thermal energy storage, other options are currently being studied, to increase the storage density or to reduce the cost of the storage. The authors have been developing a system which combines the advantages of stratified sensible heat storage and latent, phase change heat storage; i.e. a hot water storage tank with stratification where a phase change material (PCM) is included into a spiral tube installed in the top of the tank. The PCM used was a granular PCM-graphite compound of about 90 vol.% of sodium acetate trihydrate and 10 vol.% graphite. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the performance of the new storage concept, and of a conventional hot water storage tank for comparison. The data are further analysed with respect to the energetic and exergetic performance of the two systems. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2008
A novel method of processing sheet metals: Electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming,"To improve the formability of sheet metals at room temperature and overcome the limitation of the upper limit of energy storage in electrohydraulic forming (EHF), a novel sheet metal forming is proposed: electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming (ETEF). The power to deform a metal sheet originates from the electrical explosion of a metal wire in a liquid chamber and that releasing chemical energy from the energetic materials (EMs) being triggered. Equi-biaxial stretching tests of DP600 were carried out through ETEF with different weight ratios and changing grams under a low discharge voltage. The final profiles, strain and thickness distribution of the sheet were analyzed. The energetic materials with 10 wt.%Al/90 wt.%AP had an energy level of 3.04 kJ/g, and the bulging height of the deformed specimen was 34 mm, which was higher than the energy levels obtained under other testing conditions. Compared with that of the 7 kV specimen of the same bulging height (34 mm) obtained by EHF, the strain concentration region of the specimen processed under the 2 g/3 kV/10 wt. % Al/90 wt.%AP conditions widened by 52.5 %, and the maximum major strain and maximum thinning rates were lower by 10.6 % and 13.1 %, respectively. The dynamic deformation characteristics of the DP600 specimens during ETEF were presented for the first time by LS-DYNA. The values obtained for the DP600 sheet were as follows: maximum bulging height, 32 mm; maximum effective strain rate, 1521/s; and maximum speed, 258 m/ s.",2021
Chemoinformatics for the Safety of Energetic and Reactive Materials at Ineris,"The characterization of physical hazards of substances is a key information to manage the risks associated to their use, storage and transport. With decades of work in this area, Ineris develops and implements cutting-edge experimental facilities allowing such characterizations at different scales and under various conditions to study all of the dreaded accident scenarios. This review presents the efforts engaged by Ineris more recently in the field of chemoinformatics to develop and use new predictive methods for the anticipation and management of industrials risks associated to energetic and reactive materials as a complement to experiments. An overview of the methods used for the development of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for physical hazards are presented and discussed regarding the specificities associated to this class of properties. A review of models developed at Ineris is also provided from the first tentative models on the explosivity of nitro compounds to the successful application to the flammability of organic mixtures. Then, a discussion is proposed on the use of QSPR models. Good practices for robust use for QSPR models are recalled with specific comments related to physical hazards, notably for regulatory purpose. Dissemination and training efforts engaged by Ineris are also presented. The potential offered by these predictive methods in terms of in silico design and for the development of new intrinsically safer technologies in safety-by-design strategies is finally discussed. At last, challenges and perspectives to extend the application of chemoinformatics in the field of safety and in particular for the physical hazards of energetic and reactive substances are proposed.",2022
Parameter regulation of underwater shock waves based on exploding-wire-ignited energetic materials,"This paper proposed and verified a method for adjusting parameters of underwater shock waves. In the experiments, a metal wire with an energetic material coat was exploded by applying a pulsed current on it. Under different matches of size/material of wire, mass/type of energetic material, and injected pulsed current, characteristics of shock waves were obtained. It has been proven that peak pressure, impulse, and energy of shock waves can be conveniently regulated by simply changing the explosion of either the wire or its energetic material coat. Finally, the mechanisms of this method were analyzed and potential applications discussed. Published under license by AIP Publishing.",2019
Time-Resolved Spectroscopy of Initiation and Ignition of Flash-Heated Nanoparticle Energetic Materials,"Nanotechnology has brought a great deal of excitement to research in energetic materials(EMs). Nanoparticle EMs have high densities of stored energy and the potential for multifunctionality. Here we discuss research on fundamental mechanisms of initation and ignition of EM with Al or B fuel nanoparticles and Teflon(AF) or nitrocellulose (NC) oxidizer. Polybutadiene (PB) was also used as an inert. The thin-film samples were confined between two windows and were activated by flash-heating the metal nanoparticles with picosecond laser pulses. Reactions of isolated nanoparticles with their surroundings were studied by measuring ablation thresholds. A shock-induced polymer dissociation model was needed to explain the growth of the reaction volume surrounding a flash-heated fuel particle. Thicker oxide passivation layers confined the nanoparticle allowing the pressure to build up to higher values during flash-heating. Initiation, as the onset of chemical reactivity, was probed using time-resolved Raman or infrared to monitor disappearance of nitrato (ONO2) of NC or CF2, CF3,or CFO of Teflon(AF). Ignition, the onset of energy-releasing processes, was studied by analyzing time-dependent spectra of emission bursts. In flash-heated Al/Teflon, initiation occurs in similar to 50 ps and ignition occurs in similar to 100 ps. In B/Teflon, ignition occurs in similar to 200 ps. Transient opacity measurements of Al/Teflon suggest that chemical reactivity beyond the initial exothermic formation of AlF occurs within similar to 5 ns.",2012
Ti/CuO Nanothermite Doped with Secondary Energetic Materials: A Study of Combustion Parameters,"Nanothermites have found broad applications; however, due to being systems largely reacting in condensed phases, their performance is somewhat limited by heat and mass transfer. In order to alleviate this issue, nanothermites doped with gas-generating energetic materials have been developed. In this work, we present an investigation of a model Ti/CuO nanothermite doped by four classical energetic materials and investigate their properties and combustion performance. Mechanical and laser irradiation sensitivity, as well as ignition/explosion temperatures have been determined for the studied systems to establish their safety features. In terms of combustion performance, thrust force parameters and linear combustion velocity have been determined and the structure of the evolving flame front was recorded during open-air combustion experiments. The obtained results indicate that the developed doped nanothermite formulations are extremely promising materials for future applications.",2024
Mechanical Behavior of Polytetrafluoroethylene/Aluminum Energetic Materials under High and Low Temperature Conditions,"In order to simulate the temperature of the space environment and obtain the dynamic mechanical properties of the PTFE/Al energetic material under different temperature conditions, the influence of temperature on the mechanical properties of the material is revealed. In this paper, dynamic compression experiments of the typical PTFE/Al energetic materials (PTFE and Al mass percentage is 73.5:26.5, 80 MPa pressing, vacuum sintering) with different strain rates at temperatures of - 100 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C have been performed by using the quasi-static compressive experimental system, the SHPB experimental system and combined with high and low temperature supporting devices. The strain rate and temperature effects of PTFE/Al energetic material were analyzed, and a constitutive model describing the dynamic mechanical properties of PTFE/Al at high and low temperatures was obtained. Finally, a high-speed camera system was used to study the impact initiation phenomenon during the dynamic compression of PTFE/Al energetic materials. The results show that PTFE/Al energetic materials have obvious strain strengthening, strain rate hardening and temperature-softening effects. When the Johnson-Cook model is used to fit the constitutive of PTFE/Al energetic materials, the power function formed in the Cowper-Symonds constitutive relationship has a good agreement on the strain rate hardening term in the Johnson-Cook model. The PTFE/Al energetic material has the delay initiation phenomenon at low loading speed.",2023
Computational assessment of nitrogen-rich peracids: a family of peroxide-based energetic materials,"Nitrogen-rich 5- and 6-membered compounds substituted with nitro and peracid groups were designed and investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The calculated energetic properties of peracid compounds were compared with those of some classical explosives such as TNT and RDX. The computed results show that most of the designed peracids possess large positive heats of formation (HOF) and much higher densities (1.79-1.89 g cm(-3)). The predicted detonation properties impart performance superior to that of TNT and comparable to that of RDX. The relatively better oxygen balance results in higher heat of detonation and more gaseous combustion products. Based on the predicted energetic properties of the designed compounds, the present study emphasizes the potential of the peracid group in developing new energetic materials.",2017
Linking nanoscale mechanical behavior to bulk physical properties and phenomena of energetic materials,"The hardness and reduced modulus of aspirin, RDX, HMX, TATB, FOX-7, ADAAF, and TNT/CL-20 were experimentally measured with nanoindentation. These values are reported for the first time using as-received micron sized crystals of energetic materials with no additional mechanical processing. The results for TATB, ADAAF, and TNT/CL-20 are the first of their kind, while comparisons to previous nanoindentation studies on large, carefully grown single crystals of the other energetic materials show that mechanical properties of the larger crystals are comparable to crystals in the condition they are practically used. Measurements on aspirin demonstrate the variation that can occur between nanoindentation indents based on the orientation of a Berkovich tip relative to the surface of the sample. The Hertzian elastic contact model was used to analyze the materials initial yield, or pop-in, behavior. The length, energy, indentation load, and shear stress at initial yielding were used to characterize each material. For the energetic materials the length and energy of the yield excursions were compared to the drop weight sensitivity. This comparison revealed a general trend that more impact sensitive materials have longer, more severe pop-in excursions. Hot spot initiation mechanisms involving crystal defects such as void collapses and dislocation pile-up followed by avalanche are supported by these trends. While this only takes one aspect of impact sensitivity into consideration, if this trend is observed in a larger range of energetics these methods could possibly be used to great advantage in the early stages of new explosives synthesis to obtain an estimation of drop weight sensitivity.",2016
"Energetic materials under high pressures and temperatures: stability, polymorphism and decomposition of RDX","A recent progress in understanding the response of energetic crystal of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) to high pressures and temperatures is summarized. The optical spectroscopy and imaging studies under static compression and high temperatures provided new insight into phase diagram, polymorphism and decomposition mechanisms at pressures and temperatures relevant to those under shock compression. These results have been used to aid the understanding of processes under shock compression, including the shock-induced phase transition and identification of the crystal phase at decomposition. This work demonstrates that studies under static compression and high temperatures provide important complementary route for elucidating the physical and chemical processes in shocked energetic crystals.",2012
MESOSCALE SIMULATIONS OF SHOCK INITIATION IN ENERGETIC MATERIALS CHARACTERIZED BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL NANOTOMOGRAPHY,"Three-dimensional shock simulations of energetic materials have been conducted to improve our understanding of initiation at the mesoscale. Vapor-deposited films of PETN and pressed powders of HNS were characterized with a novel three-dimensional nanotomographic technique. Detailed microstructures were constructed experimentally from a stack of serial electron micrographs obtained by successive milling and imaging in a dual-beam FIB/SEM. These microstructures were digitized and imported into a multidimensional, multimaterial Eulerian shock physics code. The simulations provided insight into the mechanisms of pore collapse in PETN and HNS samples with distinctly different three-dimensional pore morphology and distribution. This modeling effort supports investigations of microscale explosive phenomenology and elucidates mechanisms governing initiation of secondary explosives.",2009
Particle Size Characteristics of Energetic Materials Distributed from Low-Order Functioning Mortar Munitions,"Particles of explosive filler distributed from low-order (LO) munition functioning are susceptible to dissolution and potential mobilization into groundwater and surface water. We command-initiated three mortar munitions as LO in triplicate using a fuze simulator and recovered particles from an ice surface to constrain LO particle characteristics. Total explosive mass recovery (19-55%) and spatial distribution (0->20 m) varied significantly both between munitions and between replicate LOs of the same munition. The median particle size (0.27-3.99 mm) varied with total mass recovery. In general, LO particles coarsened, and total mass deposition rates decreased logarithmically, with increasing distance from the initiation point.",
Predicting the impact sensitivities of energetic materials through zone-center phonon up-pumping,"The development of new energetic materials (EMs) is accompanied by significant hazards, prompting interest in their computational design. Before reliable in silico design strategies can be realized, however, approaches to understand and predict EM response to mechanical impact must be developed. We present here a fully ab initio model based on phonon up-pumping that successfully ranks the relative impact sensitivity of a series of organic EMs. The methodology depends only on the crystallographic unit cell and Brillouin zone center vibrational frequencies. We, therefore, expect this approach to become an integral tool in the large-scale screening of potential EMs.",2021
Nitrogen-Rich Tetranuclear Metal Complex as a New Structural Motif for Energetic Materials,"For designing energetic materials (EMs), the most challenging issue is to achieve a balance between energetic performance and reliable stability. In this work, we employed an efficient and convenient method to synthesize a new class of EMs: nitrogen-rich tetranuclear metal complexes [M(Hdtim)(H2O)(2)](4) (M = Zn 1, Mn 2; H(3)dtim = 1H-imidazol-4,5-tetrazole) with the N content of >46%. The structural analyses illustrate that isomorphous compounds 1 and 2 feature isolated hollow ellipsoid tetranuclear units, which are linked by both pi-pi interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions to give a 3D supramolecular architecture. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit prominent energetic characteristics: excellent detonation performances and reliable thermal, impact, and friction stabilities. Being nitrogen-rich tetrazolate compounds, the enthalpies of combustion of 1 (-11.570 kJ g(-1)) and 2 (-12.186 kJ g(-1)) are higher than those of classical EMs, RDX and HMX, and they possess high positive heats of formation. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that 1 and 2 are insensitive to external mechanical action. Excellent energetic performances and low sensitivities promote 1 and 2 to serve as a new class of promising EMs with a desirable level of safety.",2017
Interfacial effects on fracture nucleation and propagation in crystalline-amorphous energetic material systems,"Local failure modes, such as the nucleation and propagation of a pre-existing crack, have been investigated for energetic materials with a viscoelastic binder and crystalline grains subjected to dynamic thermal and mechanical loading conditions. A crystalline plasticity with dislocation density, finite viscoelasticity, dynamic fracture nucleation and propagation methods, and finite element methods were used to study crack nucleation and propagation due to dynamic thermal and mechanical loading conditions. The interrelated effects of dislocation densities, grain boundary (GB) misorientations, polymer binder relaxation, and interactions between crystal and binder were coupled to material thermal decomposition, adiabatic inelastic heating, viscous dissipation heating, and thermal conduction to analyze interfacial fracture behavior in RDX-estane systems. The predictions indicate that cracks propagated toward the binder and were arrested due to the viscous nature of the polymer binder and plasticity buildup. For low angle misorientations, the pre-existing crack propagated toward the binder with increasing crack tip speed until it reaches the binder, at which point the crack was arrested. For high angle misorientations, the crack propagated toward the binder and was arrested, adjacent to the binder, due to plastic deformation and lattice rotations. A secondary crack eventually nucleated and propagated to the interface, where it was arrested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
"Computational study of substituted 2,2′-bi-1H-imidazole as high energetic materials","Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for a series of 2,2'-bi-1H-imidazole derivatives. The B3LYP and B3P86 functionals with 6-311G** basis set were used. The heats of formation (HOFs) were predicted through designed isodesmic reactions. Calculated results show that the HOFs decrease as the -NO2 groups being replaced by -NF2, but the HOFs increase as the -NO2 groups being replaced by -N-3. When the -NO2 groups are replaced by -NH2, the HOFs initially decrease then increase. As for the isomeric compounds, the HOFs decrease following the increase of the number of hydrogen bonds for the different substituent position. At B3LYP/6-311G** level, the HOF of 4,4'-diamino-5,5'-dinitro-2,2'-bi-1H-imidazole is the smallest (125.2 kJ/mol), and the HOF of 4,4',5,5'-tetraazido-2,2'-bi-1H-imidazole is the largest (1608.9 kJ/mol). The magnitudes of intramolecular group interactions were predicted through the disproportionation energies. The E-disproportion of 4,4'-diamino-5,5'-dinitro-2,2'-bi-1H-imidazole is -70.3 kJ/mol and is the smallest among the title compounds, but that of 4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-2,2'-bi-1H-imidazole is the largest, which is 128.1 kJ/mol. Thermal stabilities were evaluated via bond dissociation energies (BDE) at the UB3LYP/6-311G** level. The BDEZPE value for C-NO2 bond, 270.0 kJ/mol in average, is the smallest compared to other types of bonds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2009

Ammonium Perchlorate and Ammonium Dihydrogen Phosphate as Energetic Materials: Comparison to Ammonium Nitrate,"Ammonium perchlorate (NH4ClO4) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) are investigated through laser ablation/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization processes, anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and density functional theory calculations. No parent anionic species are observed in the mass spectra of these two energetic species. Instead, abundant fragmentation ions for perchlorate are (NH4ClO4-H2O)-and ClO3- and those for dihydrogen phosphate are (NH4H2PO4-H2O)(-) and PO3-. Their vertical detachment energies and anionic structures are determined and identified through calculations. (NH4H2PO4-H3O)(-) is additionally detected through PES. Both NH4ClO4- and NH4H2PO4- parent anions possess a dipole bound extra electron distributed around the H atoms of the NH4 group. Based on the calculations, the fragmentation pathway for loss of H2O from either molecule involves detachment of two hydrogens from NH4 and one O from ClO4 or PO4H2. These current investigation results are compared to those previously established for NH4NO3, which include hydration, addition of H, isomerization, and reactive intermediate formation. The rich anion chemistry found for NH4NO3 is thereby further emphasized and characterized. This chemistry may well be responsible for NH4NO3's enhanced energetic properties.",2019
Multiscale Analysis of Particle Size-dependent Steady Compaction Waves in Granular Energetic Materials,"A multiscale model is used to analyze the compaction processes in granular HMX beds composed of different particle sizes (coarse particles, d = 40 mu m and microfine particles, d = 4 mu m). The localization strategy of Gonthier is extended to include changes in thermal energy induced by compression. The variation in yield strength caused by solid-liquid phase change is also considered. Analysis of the steady-state wave structure indicates that the compaction behavior of a porous material is dependent on particle size. For solid volume fraction phi(s) < 0.88, the fine particle beds provide greater resistance to compaction than the coarse particle beds, and they propagate compaction waves that travel at faster speeds. When phi(s) > 0.88, the physical state of the compacted bed has become very similar for the two materials. For subsonic compaction waves, the evolution of the grain temperature shows that large particles lead to large hot spots and high temperature and coarse particles are more shock sensitive at low shock pressures. For supersonic compaction waves, compression induced changes in thermal energy play an important role in localization strategy. It increases the localization sphere center radius. The dissipated energy is deposited over a larger localization volume so that the grain temperature near the intergranular contact surface is reduced significantly. The localization center radius further increases because of the decrease in the yield strength caused by solid-liquid phase change. Consequently, the peak grain temperature is reduced further.",2012
The High-Pressure Characterization of Energetic Materials: 1-Methyl-5-Nitramino-1,"Pressure volume relations and optical Raman and In spectra of polycrystalline 1MNT have been obtained under quasi-hydrostatic conditions up to 16 and 40 GPa. respectively. by using diamond anvil cell. synchrotron-based angle-resolved X-ray diffraction, and microspectroscopy The X-ray measurements show that the pressure volume relations remain smooth up to 16 GPa at room temperature. while vibrational measurements show no evidence of a phase transition to near 40 GPa Anomalous increases of several vibrational intensities and bandwidths suggest that subtle molecular distortions and structural modifications occur in the crystal as pressure increases Decompression experiments indicate the structural modifications are reversible",2010
Continuum modeling predictions of nonlinear specific heat in phase transition of energetic materials,"We propose a chemo-thermal-mechanical model that considers phase transition phenomena, heat generation due to chemical reactions and mechanical deformations, and finite strain elastoplastic behavior. We implement this highly nonlinear model in a state-of-the-art finite element solver. We study the chemical, thermal, and mechanical processes in the phase change of heterogeneous reactive materials at the microstructural level. The model is calibrated and applied to the HMX ������ & RARR; ������ phase transition within plastic-bonded explosives. We present computational results such as chemical heating extrema, highly nonlinear and non-equilibrium specific heat, and accumulated plastic strain in representative unit cells for several volume fractions and heating histories. We show that particle volume fraction and sample heating rate are highly relevant for the pre-ignition response of plastic-bonded explosives to thermomechanical loads. We predict highly nonlinear specific heats for a finite system at the continuum level. Moreover, we utilize an analytic expression that estimates with a high degree of accuracy the critical temperature at which the maximum chemical heat release occurs.",2023
Laser-induced energetic material ignition with various fluorinated graphenes: Theoretical and experimental studies,"Fluorinated graphene (FG) as energetic material has a wide range of application due to its unique light-to-heat conversion, thermal and oxidation properties. The structure of FG, especial the fluorinated degree of FG is a key parameter to achieve those applications. In this study, the effect of the fluorinated degree of FG on the laser ignition of a typical energetic material of 2,4,6,8,10,12-(hexanitrohexaaza) cyclododecane (CL-20) was studied by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations. The interaction mechanism between the FG and CL-20 was studied by the simulation through adsorption energy and the electron density difference variations. Simultaneously, graphene materials with different fluorinated degrees were prepared by the hydrothermal method experimentally, the photothermal conversion behavior and laser ignition characteristics of graphene with different degrees of fluoride were characterized. Simulation and experimental results show that CL-20 and graphene with a low degree of fluorination have stronger adsorption energy and lower laser induced ignition delay time than those of the other conditions. This research provides an atomic-scale explanation for the laser induced ignition mechanism of fluorinated graphene in energetic materials.",2021
Ammonia Oxide as a Building Block for High-Performance and Insensitive Energetic Materials,"3,5-Dinitrimino-1,2,4-triazole (2) with three protons has the potential of deprotonation to form energetic salts. Neutralization of 2 with 50% hydroxylamine in varying molar ratios leads to the formation of the corresponding mono/dihydroxylammonium energetic salts. Additionally compound 5, an ammonia oxide adduct of dihydroxylammonium 3,5-dinitramino-1,2,4-triazolate, was prepared when excess hydroxylamine was used. The structures of 3-5 are supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The energetic properties of the new materials are competitive. Utilization of ammonia oxide adducts in hydroxylammonium energetic salts could lead to future practical applications as energetic materials.",2017
Modelling of the transition from conductive to convective burning in porous energetic materials,"This paper is concerned with a theoretical interpretation of an abrupt shift from the slow conductive to fast convective burning observed in the combustion of gas-permeable explosives under gradual elevation of the ambient pressure. The paper is a revision of our recent communication on the problem, and is based on the amended heat equation, which meets the requirement of the conservation of energy lacking in the previous model. It appears, however, that both formulations lead (in appropriately chosen units) to a largely similar picture of the transition. The transition is triggered by a localised autoignition in the extended resistance-induced preheat zone formed ahead of the advancing deflagration, provided the pressure difference between hot gas products and gases deep inside the pores of the unburned solid exceed a certain critical level. For moderately high activation energies the critical overpressures are comparable to those observed experimentally. In line with observations, the critical overpressure increases with diminishing permeability. The amended formulation implies the possibility of overpressure-driven gasification waves occurring even in the absence of chemical heat release.",2012
Preparation and Properties of HMX Coated with a Composite of TNT/Energetic Material,"To improve the safety of HMX without sacrificing. enemy properties. the composites of TNT and an energetic material (HP-1) were used to coat HMX particles by a method of integrating solvent - nonsolvent with aqueous suspension-melting SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectrometry) were employed to characterize the samples The effect of the processing parameters. such as mass ratio of HP-I to TNT (MRHT). stirring speed. and cooling rate, on the quality 01 coated samples were investigated and discussed The mechanical sensitivity. thermal sensitivity. the decomposition characteristic, and heat of detonation of raw and coated HMX samples were also measured and contrasted Results show that when MRHT. stirring speed in the second stage and cooling late are 1 5. 1000 I min(-1) and 5 degrees C min(-1) respectively, the optimal coating effect is achieved Compared with that of raw HMX. both impact and friction sensitivity of HMX coated with 2 5 wt -% TNT and 0 5 wt -% HP-I decrease obviously. whereas there is a slight change in their thermal sensitivity and thermal decomposition chatacteristics Meanwhile, such surface coating, does not result in the decrease of its energy properties",2010
C,"In this study, an azido-based compound 4, N,N '-methylenebis(N-(4-azido-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)nitramide), was synthesized and fully characterized. The crystal structure of 4 was determined for the first time to investigated the structure-performance relationship. Material 4 exhibited compact face-to-face and wavelike stacking. The introduction of nitro groups resulted in compound 4 having a zero oxygen balance based on carbon monoxide, which was out of the ordinary for azido-based materials. Such an excellent crystal arrangement and oxygen balance provided compound 4 with a better detonation performance (D: 9018 m s(-1); P: 34.5 GPa), which indicated its application as a promising high-energy-density material.",2021
High-Resolution Terahertz Spectroscopy for Investigation of Energetic Materials During Their Thermal Decomposition,"The possibilities of using high-resolution terahertz spectroscopy for studying the composition of vapors of energy materials during their thermal decomposition were investigated. A high resolution nonstationary spectrometer for gas analysis based on the phase-shift of 115-178 GHz radiation acting on gas and a system heating the measuring cell and the reaction volume were developed and implemented. Possible mechanisms of thermal decomposition were found for four substances (ammonium nitrate, pentaerythritetetranitrate, octogen, triaminotrinitrobenzene) and sets of substances appearing during their thermolysis were determined experimentally. The results obtained show that high-resolution spectroscopy operating on nonstationary effects is a promising technique for qualitative analysis of multicomponent gas mixtures of the thermal decomposition products of explosives, including the appearance of products at different stages of sample heating. Besides the developed method can be used for the analysis of gas mixtures (gases, vapors, natural, and thermal decomposition products) of various origins for many applications (biology, medicine, agricultural applications).",2021
Self-assembled core-shell structured Si@CuO energetic materials for enhanced exothermic performance,"Si is considered as a promising fuel for energetic materials and has received increasing attention. In this study, a novel core-shell structure Si@CuO energetic material was successfully synthesized by self-assembly method. Poly(4-vinylpyridine) was used as cross linker to coat nano-CuO on the surface of nano-Si to form core-shell structure Si@CuO energetic material. The morphology and composition of the nano-Si, nano-CuO and Si@CuO energetic materials were investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results demonstrate that the maximum actual heat release of Si@CuO with core-shell structure is 1061.4 J/g when the equivalent ratio is 1.0, which is greater than 532.8 J/g of Si/CuO energetic materials prepared by ultrasonic mixing method. These results provide a helpful and practical strategy for the preparation of energetic materials with long-term storage stability.",2019
Nutritional stress induces exchange of cell material and energetic coupling between bacterial species,"Knowledge of the behaviour of bacterial communities is crucial for understanding biogeochemical cycles and developing environmental biotechnology. Here we demonstrate the formation of an artificial consortium between two anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium acetobutylicum (Gram-positive) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (Gram-negative, sulfate-reducing) in which physical interactions between the two partners induce emergent properties. Molecular and cellular approaches show that tight cell-cell interactions are associated with an exchange of molecules, including proteins, which allows the growth of one partner (Desulfovibrio vulgaris) in spite of the shortage of nutrients. This physical interaction induces changes in expression of two genes encoding enzymes at the pyruvate crossroads, with concomitant changes in the distribution of metabolic fluxes, and allows a substantial increase in hydrogen production without requiring genetic engineering. The stress induced by the shortage of nutrients of Desulfovibrio vulgaris appears to trigger the interaction.",2015
-Trinitroethylamino functionalization of nitroimidazoles: a new strategy for high performance energetic materials,"An N-functionalized strategy, including N-amination and N-trinitroethylamination, was utilized for the synthesis of nitroimidazole-based energetic materials, giving rise to a new family of highly insensitive N-aminonitroimidazoles and oxygen-rich N-trinitroethylaminonitroimidazoles with good to excellent properties. These new energetic materials were fully characterized by IR, H-1, and C-13 NMR, elemental analysis, and some high performance compounds were further confirmed by N-15 NMR (4a, 4d, 6a, 6b, and 6d), as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction (6a and 6b). N-Functionalization of nitroimidazoles not only gives rise to the N-aminonitroimidazoles as impact insensitive and thermally stable materials (IS > 40 J; T-d: 144-308 degrees C), but also provides a series of N-trinitroethylaminoimidazoles, which have favorable densities (1.75-1.84 g cm(-3)), good detonation properties (P: 27.6-35.9 GPa; v(D): 7815-8659 m s(-1)), and moderate thermal stabilities (136-172 degrees C). These properties are better than some known energetic compounds, such as TNT (P: 19.5 GPa; v(D): 6881 m s(-1)) and TATB (P: 31.2 GPa; v(D): 8114 m s(-1)), and are comparable to RDX (P: 35.0 GPa; v(D): 8762 m s(-1)).",2013
Design and operation of membrane microcalorimeters for thermal screening of highly energetic materials,"Following several terrorist attacks that have occurred during this decade, there is an urgent need to develop new technologies for the detection of highly energetic materials that can represent an explosive hazard. In an effort to contribute to the development of these new technologies, this work presents the design aspects of a chip-scale calorimeter that can be used to detect an explosive material by calorimetric methods. The aim of this work is to apply what has been done in the area of chip-scale calorimetry to the screening of highly energetic materials. The prototypes presented here were designed using computer assisted design and finite element analysis tools. The design parameters were set to satisfy the requirements of a sensor that can be integrated into a portable system (handheld) for field applications. The design approach consisted of developing a sensor with thick silicon membranes that can hold micro-size samples and that can operate at high temperatures, while keeping the cost of the sensor low. Contrary to other high resolution systems based on thin-film membranes, our prototypes exhibit a contribution from addenda that is comparable to that from the sample, and hence they have lower sensitivity. However, using thick membranes offers the advantage of producing sensors strong enough for this application and that have significantly lower cost. Once the prototypes were designed, the fabrication was performed using standard microfabrication techniques. Finally, the operation of our prototypes was demonstrated by conducting thermal analysis of different liquid and solid samples.",2010
On the excited electronic state dissociation of nitramine energetic materials and model systems,"In order to elucidate the difference between nitramine energetic materials, such as RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane), HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane), and CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane), and their nonenergetic model systems, including 1,4-dinitropiperazine, nitropiperidine, nitropyrrolidine, and dimethylnitramine, both nanosecond mass resolved excitation spectroscopy and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy in the UV spectral region have been employed to investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of the excited electronic state photodissociation of these materials. The NO molecule is an initial decomposition product of all systems. The NO molecule from the decomposition of energetic materials displays cold rotational and hot vibrational spectral structures. Conversely, the NO molecule from the decomposition of model systems shows relatively hot rotational and cold vibrational spectra. In addition, the intensity of the NO ion signal from energetic materials is proportional to the number of nitramine functional groups in the molecule. Based upon experimental observations and theoretical calculations of the potential energy surface for these systems, we suggest that energetic materials dissociate from ground electronic states after internal conversion from their first excited states, and model systems dissociate from their first excited states. In both cases a nitro-nitrite isomerization is suggested to be part of the decomposition mechanism. Parent ions of dimethylnitramine and nitropyrrolidine are observed in femtosecond experiments. All the other molecules generate NO as a decomposition product even in the femtosecond time regime. The dynamics of the formation of the NO product is faster than 180 fs, which is equivalent to the time duration of our laser pulse.

Towards Automated and Explorative Characterization of Nano-Energetic Material Response to Directed Energy,"Nanoenergetic materials offer high-density energy storage that may react to produce heat and release gaseous products. In order to utilize aluminum-based nanoenergetic materials effectively, the mechanisms by which aluminum fuel reacts to escape a passivating aluminum shell must be better understood. These mechanisms are affected by numerous parameters in both the laser-based photothermal heating setup to incite reactions as well as in the shape, size, and composition of the material itself. The vast number of parameters greatly increases the size of the search space when seeking a quantitative mapping between reaction parameters and reaction type. This thesis aims to accelerate this search through the creation of an autonomous image processing pipeline for nanoenergetic material reaction imagery, as well as a subsequent reaction classifier. The imagery is captured at 100x magnification utilizing optical microscopy and, various preprocessing methods are explored to aid in highlighting distinctive image features for characterizing reaction type. To perform the classification, we began with hand-crafted features and ensemble machine learning. Building on this, we modified a state-of-the-art transformer-based model for change detection to perform reaction classification. In doing so, we validated an abundant analog for nanoenergetic material, cell nuclei, to utilize for pre-training. Finally, we investigate texture-based image features of nanoenergetic material in scanning electron microscope (SEM) imagery. By leveraging this texture analysis, we can effectively isolate nanoenergetic material clusters within SEM imagery enabling autonomous laser targeting and imaging in an SEM environment.",2023
Molecular design and performance prediction of poly-dinitroamino pyrrole compounds as energetic materials,"To identify superior and safe energetic materials, eighteen poly-dinitroamino pyrrole derivatives were studied at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of density functional theory (DFT). The isodesmic reactions were employed to calculate the heats of formation (HOFs) for these compounds. The detonation velocity (D) and pressure (P) were evaluated using the Kamlet-Jacobs equations. Results indicate that -N(NO2)(2) group is an effective substituent for enhancing the detonation performance since most of the molecules have larger energy density than RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane), and a few molecules, C1(N-R) - D3(N-R), with D ranging from 8.55 to 9.04 km s(-1) and P ranging from 35.53 to 40.36 GPa outperform RDX (D= 8.75 km s(-1) and P= 34.00 GPa). The calculated bond dissociation energy (BDE) revealed that the new compounds exhibit good thermal stability and meet the requirements of energetic materials. Besides, the N-NO2 bond on the side chain was found to be the trigger bond during decomposition. The characteristic height (h (50)) of the compound was calculated, and thirteen compounds exhibited lower sensitivity than CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane).",2017
Characteristics of the underwater explosion of a nonideally detonating aluminum-rich energetic material,"An experimental study of the characteristics of the explosion of mixtures of ammonium perchlorate, aluminum, and nitromethane with a large excess of aluminum (1.45 to 1.66 g/cm(3) in density) confined in plastic enclosures and immersed in small elastic-wall reservoirs with water is conducted. It is shown that composite charges, 20 mm in diameter, surrounded by a water layer of thickness 20-30 cm and detonate in a nonideal detonation mode. High-speed cinematography records show the possibility of the intense mixing of the detonation products with the surrounding water and of the burning of excess aluminum particles in a heterogeneous cloud. The time scales of the development of secondary energy release by burning of aluminum particles in water are estimated. The possibility of controlling the characteristics of the pressure waves generated by the explosion, for example, by means of a preliminary bubbling of the water with air near the charge, is demonstrated.",2011
Modeling and numerical simulation of deflagration-to-detonation transition in porous energetic materials,"An understanding of the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in porous energetic materials is important for various engineering applications. Safety issues for damaged explosives is one example. In this work, two topics related to multi-dimensional simulation of DDT in energetic materials are presented. The objective of the first part is to develop a simple and predictive model for multidimensional simulations. Models constructed by two-phase mixture theory usually have complicated mathematical formulation, and admit complex dispersive wave structures. Three simplified single-velocity models, named BKS, SVG and GISPA, are considered in this work. The BKS model was derived--using asymptotic theory--from the two-phase theory by assuming a large interphase drag. The SVG model is newly developed, based on solid-void-gas three-phase formulation. The GISPA model is a new single-phase model which utilizes two independent rate processes for compaction and reaction. In addition to model simplification, a new reaction rate law is developed which describes the slow and the fast energy-release processes during DDT. A comparative study is carried out and the study shows that the SVG and GISPA models are able to predict all the events measured in 1-D DDT-tube experiments. The second part of the study describes the development of a high-quality numerical method for two-dimensional DDT simulations. The new fourth-order method integrates total variation diminishing and essentially non-oscillatory schemes with an extension to a general equation of state. In order to handle complex geometry, an internal boundary algorithm is developed on a structured grid, which allows a two-dimensional, non-deformable body of an arbitrary shape to be inserted in a flow field. A DDT simulation is carried out for cases of both blunt-body and sharp-body impact on porous energetic materials. The radius effect (in the case of blunt-body impact) and the angle effect (in the case of sharp-body impact) on detonation properties are studied.",1996
Cu-Containing Faujasite-Type Zeolite as an Additive in Eco-Friendly Energetic Materials,"Regarding the current state of the art on the utilization of zeolites in industry, the application of zeolites as an additive to eco-friendly energetic materials indicates the innovative character of the present research. One of the most commonly used energetic materials in the mining industry (engineering works) is ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil), due to its easy and cheap production procedure as well as its good energetic properties and vast possibilities for modification. In the present research, we investigated Cu-zeolite with a faujasite structure (Cu-FAU) as a modifier of ANFO-based energetic materials. Analysis of the results obtained from thermodynamic calculations of energetic performance led to the conclusion that the application of Cu-faujasite as an additive to ANFO resulted in a relevant reduction in the total emission of post-decomposition fumes, with simultaneous enhancement of the energetic properties of the energetic material, which corresponded with the changes in the status of the surface and the reduced thermal effect accompanying the ammonium nitrate's decomposition. From analysis of both the energetic performance and fumes, it may be concluded that our eco-friendly and enhanced energetic material can be used as a low-emission source of energy for the quarrying of raw materials.",2024
An Alliance of Polynitrogen Heterocycles: Novel Energetic Tetrazinedioxide-Hydroxytetrazole-Based Materials,"Energetic materials constitute one of the most important subtypes of functional materials used for various applications. A promising approach for the construction of novel thermally stable high-energy materials is based on an assembly of polynitrogen biheterocyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a new series of high-nitrogen energetic salts comprising the C-C linked 6-aminotetrazinedioxide and hydroxytetrazole frameworks. Synthesized materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. As a result of a vast amount of the formed intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, prepared ammonium and amino-1,2,4-triazolium salts are thermally stable and have good densities of 1.75-1.78 g center dot cm(-3). All synthesized compounds show high detonation performance, reaching that of benchmark RDX. At the same time, as compared to RDX, investigated salts are less friction sensitive due to the formed net of hydrogen bonds. Overall, reported functional materials represent a novel perspective subclass of secondary explosives and unveil further opportunities for an assembly of biheterocyclic next-generation energetic materials.",2022
Energetic host-guest inclusion compounds: an effective design paradigm for high-energy materials,"Energetic materials are an important class of special energy materials. The tradeoffs in energy performance and safety are real challenges in developing new energetic compounds. Safe synthesis and extensive chemical and material characterization make the development of novel energetic materials time-consuming, labor-intensive and low-producing. The modification of existing energetic compounds with known properties could reduce the initial investment required for discovery and performance uncertainty. Synthesizing energetic host-guest inclusion compounds is an attractive path towards the modification of energetic materials. In this highlight, some typical energetic inclusion compounds and their structures, intermolecular interactions, stabilities, and energy properties are reviewed. A strategy for using computer simulation to assist the design of energetic inclusion compounds is proposed and demonstrated.",2022
On Electromagnetic-Acoustic Analogies in Energetic Relations for Waves Interacting with Material Surfaces,In the paper we consider propagation of a monochromatic surface electromagnetic field at the interface separating two semi-infinite media a metamaterial (generally with complex permittivity and permeability) and a conventional dielectric medium. The metamaterial is treated as homogeneous and isotropic (it is so-called effective medium approximation). It is true for e.g. artificial metamaterials with negative dielectric permittivity and negative permeability in the microwave frequency range. The last materials are known as left handed and a conventional as right handed media. In this work the classical optical theorem is extended to the case of scattering of electromagnetic surface waves incident at the interface separating a left handed medium and a right handed dielectric medium. The analogous theorem is known in the scattering theory for elastic fields.,2008
Rational Screening of Cocrystals using Thermal Analysis: Benchmarking on Energetic Materials,"Cocrystal design is an important and well-developed approach in the pharmaceutical industry. Energetic materials can be thought of as unique and challenging objects for cocrystal engineering since abundant explosophoric functionalities prevent exploiting common supra molecular synthons. Screening of cocrystal formation using thermal analysis methods is investigated. A few approaches from the literature are combined in a single procedure that allows for automation, high-throughput screening, and the usage of milligrams of material. To estimate the accuracy of the screening procedure, we compiled available literature data on 213 cocrystals with energetic or very similar to energetic materials. The recommended procedure can detect cocrystal formation in 75% cases (with no false positives), according to a smaller sample data set of 28 cocrystal-forming systems. The procedure was then used to screen for novel cocrystals among several acidic energetic materials, ammonium and hydroxylammonium energetic salts, 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole as a coformers, and 13 cocrystals were discovered. Then, using the traditional solution procedure, eight novel cocrystals were prepared, and their X-ray structures were reported. One of the cocrystals discovered, a complex of promising energetic material, dihydroxylammonium 5,5 '-bistetrazole-1,1 '-diolate (also known as TKX-50) with 18-crown-6, is the first cocrystal of TKX-50 with a reported X-ray structure so far. Overall, we present a unified procedure of thermal screening for cocrystals and salts; benchmarking on challenging objects for cocrystal design (energetic materials) shows its high performance.",2022
Effect of void positioning on the detonation sensitivity of a heterogeneous energetic material,"Although it is well-established that voids profoundly influence the initiation and reaction behaviors of heterogeneous energetic materials such as polymer-bonded explosives (PBX) and propellants, there has been little study of how void location in different constituents in the microstructures of such materials affect the macroscale behavior. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) mesoscale simulations to study how void placement within the reactive grains vs the polymer binder influences the shock-to-detonation transition in a polymer-bonded explosive. The material studied here has a microstructure comprised of 75% PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) grains and 25% hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene polymer binder by volume. Porosities up to 10% in the form of spherical voids distributed in both the grains and polymer are considered. An Arrhenius reactive burn relation is used to model the chemical kinetics of the PETN grains under shock loading, thereby resolving the heterogeneous detonation behavior of the PBX. The influence of void location on the shock initiation sensitivity of the material is quantitatively ranked by comparing the predicted run distance to detonation (RDD) for each sample. The analysis includes inherent quantification of uncertainties arising from the stochastic variations in the microstructure morphologies and void distributions by using statistically equivalent microstructure sample sets, leading to probabilistic formulations for the RDD as a function of shock pressure. The calculations reveal that the location of voids in the composite microstructure significantly affects the RDD. Specifically, voids exclusively within the grains cause the PBX to be more sensitive (having shorter RDD) than voids in the polymer binder. Unique probabilistic relationships are derived to map the probability of observing RDD for each void location material case, allowing for prediction of initiation behavior anywhere in the shock pressure-RDD space. These findings agree with trends reported in the literature.",2022
Non-isothermal kinetic studies on thermal decomposition of energetic materials KNF and NTO,"Thermal stability and decomposition kinetics for two energetic materials, potassium nitroform (KNF) and 5-Nitro-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (NTO), were investigated to obtain information on their safety for handling, storage, and use. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques have been used to study thermal behavior of these energetic compounds. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the KNF occurs during two temperature ranges of 270-330 and 360-430 degrees C. Meanwhile, NTO decomposes completely in temperature range of 250-300 degrees C. TG-DTA analysis of KNF indicates that this energetic compound dehydrated (at about 108 degrees C) before its decomposition. However, NTO is thermally stable until its decomposition. The decomposition kinetic of energetic materials was studied by non-isothermal DSC under various heating rates. Kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor for thermal decomposition of energetic compounds were obtained via the methods proposed by ASTM E696 and Starink. Also, thermodynamic parameters correspond to the activation of thermal decomposition and critical ignition temperatures of the compounds were obtained.",2012
Design of information self-destruction module based on security control of energetic materials,"A self-destruction module for information storage equipment (ISE) that releases a detonation wave via energetic materials (EMs) is discussed. The module uses an energy-grooming actuator (EGA) to isolate EMs from external electronic systems to improve security. The response time of removing electrical constraint for EMs, the stress transferring of detonation wave in air domain and the response time of ISE physical self-destruction are obtained via COMSOL, LS-DYNA, the module function integration is realized by stacked graphene and platinum films and in-situ copper azide synthesis. During tests, the response time of removing electrical constraint for EMs by EGA was 0.942 ms. When a voltage pulse (below 5.5 V) exploded the EMs, the detonation wave was generated under 61.8-63.2 mu s to destroy the ISE. Overall, ISE physical self-destruction was realized with a lower driving energy, a fast response time and security control for the EMs. The module has potential applications for information security.",2022

We analyze the formation of electromagnetic hot spots and thermal gradients in the explosive-binder mesostructures and compare the heating rate for various binder systems.",2016
"A comparative study of the structure, stability and energetic performance of 5,5-bitetrazole-1,1-diolate based energetic ionic salts: future high energy density materials","Developing novel energetic materials of high detonation performance and low sensitivity is one of the primary objectives related to explosive research. By employing ab initio calculations, a series of energetic ionic salts based on 5,5-bitetrazole-1,1-diolate (BTO) were thoroughly investigated to understand the structure-property-performance interrelationship. The physicochemical and detonation characteristics of these energetic ionic salts including structural, electronic, vibrational and performance parameters (heats of formation, detonation pressures, and detonation velocities) were discussed in detail. The strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding environment between the BTO2- anion and various cations is mainly responsible for prominent detonation performance and enhanced molecular stability. Such strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds are observed in hydrazine and hydroxylammonium cations compared to other cations. To predict an accurate band gap, electronic band structures of the studied energetic ionic salts (EIS) were calculated using the HSE06 hybrid functional and they are found to be wide band gap insulators with a bandwidth ranging from 4.33-5.05 eV. Careful inspection of various EIS revealed that the hydroxylammonium and hydrazine cations produce the highest density relative to other cations when combined with the BTO anion. The detonation characteristics of BTO2- are computed using EXPLO5 code. In particular, HA-BTO and TKX-50 exhibit high detonation pressure (38.85 and 40.23 GPa) and detonation velocities (9.94 and 9.91 km s(-1)), superior to those of traditional nitrogen-rich energetic materials with moderate sensitivities. These results highlight the importance of hydrogen bonding interactions in designing energetic salts for next-generation explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics.",2018
Connecting Energetic Nitropyrazole and Nitrobenzene Moieties with C-C Bonds using Suzuki Cross-Coupling Reaction: A Novel Route to Thermally Stable Energetic Materials,"This work describes a new route to thermally stable energetic materials by connecting different types of energetic moieties (nitropyrazole and polynitrobenzene) with C-C bonds, where the first step involves a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 4-bromo-3,5-dinitro-1H-pyrazole and 4-chlorophenylboronic acid. Further nitration, amination, oxidation, and salt formation reactions on the resulting C-C coupled framework resulted in various thermally stable energetic materials. All the compounds were fully characterized using IR, NMR [H-1, C-13{H-1}], differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), elemental analysis, and HRMS studies. Compounds 7 and 9 were further characterized by N-15 NMR, and compounds 3 and 6 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Theoretical heats of formation and energetic performance for all the energetic compounds were calculated using Gaussian 09 and EXPLO5 v6.06 programs, respectively. This research introduces a novel method for synthesizing C-C coupled energetic materials that are not accessible by any other routes.",2022
Thermal decomposition and combustion characteristics of molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4 catalyzed by Co,"Co3O4 nanoclusters were prepared by the gas phase precipitation method. The heating pyrolysis characteristics of molecular perovskite-based energetic material (H(2)dabco)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] (DAP-4) by using Co3O4 nanocluster catalysts was studied. Results showed that when 5mass% Co3O4 added, the initial pyrolysis temperature and the DTG peak temperature of DAP-4 were reduced to 256.8 celcius and 340 celcius, respectively, at the heating rate of 10 K min(-1). When the average particle size (D-50) of Co3O4 was 694 nm, the activation energy (E-a) required for heating catalytic pyrolysis of DAP-4 with the presence of Co3O4 decreased to 140.8 kJ mol(-1) (Kissinger's method) and 143.6 kJ mol(-1) (Ozawa's method). The heating catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of Co3O4 nanoclusters for the heating pyrolysis of DAP-4 was proposed. This work is helpful to understand further the heating catalytic pyrolysis characteristics of molecular perovskite-based energetic materials with metal oxide nanoclusters.",2023
"Compatibility Study of Dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-Bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50) with Some Energetic Materials and Inert Materials","Dihydroxylammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) emerged as a novel energetic material with low sensitivity and excellent calculated detonation performance. The compatibility of TKX-50 with nitrocellulose (NC), an NC/NG (nitroglycerine) mixture (mass rate: 1.25:1), 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), ammonium perchlorate (AP), hexanitroethane (HNE), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), aluminum powder (Al), boron powder, and centralite was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that TKX-50/HNE possesses good compatibility, TKX-50 and HMX have moderate compatibility, and the compatibility of TKX-50 with TNT, CL-20, centralite, NC, AP, Al, and GAP is poor; in addition, TKX-50/RDX, TKX-50/NC+NG, TKX-50/B, and TKX-50/HTPB have poor compatibility.",2015
Accurate thermochemical properties for energetic materials applications. I. Heats of formation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and energetic precursor molecules from electronic structure theory.,"The heats of formation of 1H-imidazole, 1H-1,2,4-trizazole, 1H-tetrazole, CH3NO2, CH3N3, CH3NH2, CH2CHNO2, HClO4, and phenol, as well as cations and anions derived from some of the molecules have been calculated using ab initio molecular orbital theory. These molecules are important as models for compounds used for energetic materials synthesis. The predicted heats of formation of the heterocycle-based compounds are in excellent agreement with available experimental values and those derived from proton affinities and deprotonation enthalpies to <1 kcal/mol. The predicted value for the tetrazolium cation differs substantially from the experimental value, likely due to uncertainty in the measurement. The heats of formation of the nitro and amino molecules, as well as phenol/phenolate, also are in good agreement with the experimental values (<1.5 kcal/mol). The heat of formation of CH3N3 is predicted to be 72.8 kcal/mol at 298 K with an estimated error bar of +/-1 kcal/mol on the basis of the agreement between the calculated and experimental values for DeltaH(f)(HN3). The heat of formation at 298 K of HClO4 is -0.4 kcal/mol, in very good agreement with the experimental value, as well as a W2 literature study. An extrapolation of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q,5) energies was required to obtain this agreement. This result suggests that very large basis sets (> or =aug-cc-pV5Z) may be needed to fully recover the valence correlation energy contribution in compounds containing elements with high formal oxidation states at the central atom. In addition tight d functions are needed for the geometry predictions. Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) scalar relativistic corrections for HClO4 and ClO4- at the MP2 level with correlation-consistent DKH basis sets were predicted to be large, likely due to the high formal oxidation state at the Cl.",t-26
Initial Steps and Thermochemistry of Unimolecular Decomposition of Oxadiazole Energetic Materials: Quantum Chemistry Modeling,"In order to resolve the existing discrepancies in the mechanism and key intermediates of oxadiazole thermolysis, the initial decomposition pathways of oxadiazoles have been studied comprehensively using the M062X method for optimization and CBS-QB3 and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods for energies. The transformation from the furoxan ring to nitro group was suggested as a potential decay channel of furoxan compounds. Results of thermochemistry calculations showed that the preferred decomposition reaction of oxadiazoles is the ring-opening through the cleavage of the O-C or O-N bond. The introduction of the nitro group has little effect on the preferential path of oxadiazole thermal decomposition, but a great impact on the energy barrier. The lowest energy barrier and bond dissociation energy of NO2 loss of azoles were comprehensively studied based on the quantum chemistry calculations. The initial decay steps of 3,4-dinitrofurazanfuroxan and benzotrifuroxan were also studied to give insights into the mechanism of primary stages of thermal decomposition of oxadiazoles.",2021
Achieving tunable chemical reactivity through photo-initiation of energetic materials at metal oxide surfaces,"Known applications of high energy density materials are impressively vast. Despite this, we argue that energetic materials are still underutilized for common energy purposes due to our inability to control explosive chemical reactions releasing energy from these materials. The situation appears paradoxical as energetic materials (EM) possess massive amounts of energy and, hence, should be most appropriate for applications in many energy-intensive processes. Here, we discover how chemical decomposition reactions can be stimulated with laser excitation and therefore, highly controlled by selectively designing energetic material - metal oxide interfaces with an example of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)-MgO and trinitrotoluene (TNT)-MgO composite samples. Density functional theory and embedded cluster method calculations were combined with measurements of the optical absorption spectra and laser initiation experiments. We found that the first (1064 nm, 1.17 eV), second (532 nm, 2.33 eV), and third (355 nm, 3.49 eV) laser harmonics, to all of which pure energetic materials are transparent, can be effectively used to trigger explosive reactions in the PETN-MgO samples. We propose a consistent electronic mechanism that explains how specific sub-band optical transitions initiate decomposition chemistry. Also, this selectivity reveals a fundamental difference between materials chemistry at interfaces as we show on examples of PETN and TNT energetic materials.",2020
Theoretical study of the phonon states and thermodynamic properties on surfaces of energetic material,"We develop a method to calculate the local phonon states on crystal surfaces, and use it to investigate a high energy explosive, beta-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (beta-HMX). The required force constants are obtained by first principles calculations under the GGA + vdW functional. By using them, the phonon density of states (PDOSs) for thirteen kinds of surfaces are calculated, including the (100), (010), (001), (110), (1 - 10), (101), (10 - 1), (011), (01 - 1), (111), (11 - 1), (1 - 11) and (111) faces. We find that there are five representative phonon states on beta-HMX surfaces, and obtain the corresponding vibrational modes and atomic displacement fields. Based on the PDOSs, a set of surface properties are evaluated, such as the vibrational degree of freedom, surface free energy and surface heat capacity. The particle morphology of beta-HMX in vacuum is predicted by using the surface free energies. We prove that at fixed temperature, the particle morphology is independent of the particle size. The evolution of particle morphology with respect to temperature is obtained.",2018
Application of dynamic scaling to the surface properties of organic thin films: Energetic materials,"The surface evolution of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) organic films, formed by room-temperature thermal evaporation on 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid self-assembly monolayer, has been investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results are analyzed using dynamic scaling theory. High values are obtained for dynamic scaling coefficients beta = 0.56 +/- 0.02 and 1/z = 0.35 +/- 0.01, where beta is the growth exponent and 1/z is the dynamic exponent. Using mound height and in-plane correlation length the dependence of mound slope m on PETN thickness is obtained. Two thickness regimes are identified. For thickness between 40 and 300 nm, m grows rapidly due to high bulk surface diffusion with smooth PETN morphology. For thickness from 300 to 800 nm, m continues to grow but at a reduced rate. Facets are evident and crevices form in this thickness range. The surface evolution behavior is attributed to bulk surface diffusion and the presence of an Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier, which preferentially enhances step-up diffusion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Polynitroderivatives of alkoxy- and alkylendioxy-benzenes: potential HEMs and precursors of new energetic materials,"Several di-, tri- and tetranitroderivatives of alkoxy-, dialkoxy- and cyclic alkylendioxybenzene derivatives were synthesized by nitration of starting compounds in different conditions and their properties were compared to already known 2,4,6-trinitroanisole and TNT.",2010
"Two metastable high hydrates of energetic material 3,30,5,5'-tetranitro-4,4'-bipyrazole","Poly-stoichiometry of hydrated phases is relatively uncommon for organic materials and extended libraries of such species adopting different aqua-to-substrate ratios are still rare. The kinetically controlled higher hydrates could be particularly interesting for their structural relationships, which presumably may imprint some features of the substrate/substrate and aqua/substrate bonding in solutions, and provide insights into the nucleation stage. Two metastable high hydrates are prepared by crash crystallization. The crystal structures of 3,3',5,5'-tetranitro-4,4'-bipyrazole tetrahydrate, C6H2N8O8 center dot 4H(2)O, (1), and 3,3',5,5'-tetranitro-4,4'-bipyrazole pentahydrate, C6H2N8O8 center dot 5H2O, (2), are intrinsically related to the previously reported anhydrate and monohydrate, while displaying natural evolution of the patterns upon progressive watering. The accumulation of the water molecules causes their clustering, with the generation of one-dimensional tapes and two-dimensional layers in the genuine channel hydrates (1) and (2), respectively, versus the pocket hydrate structure of C6H2N8O8 center dot H2O. The hydration primarily affects the pyrazole sites. It conditions the emergence of N-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds, which is a destructive factor for pyrazole/pyrazole N-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonding. At the same time, extensive noncovalent interactions of the organic molecules, namely, lone pair-pi-hole O center dot center dot center dot N interactions of the NO2/NO2 and NO2/pyrazole types, are more competitive to the hydrogen bonding and the motifs of mutual organic/organic stacks remain intact with the increase in hydration. These trends agree with the results of Hirshfeld surface analysis. The contributions of the contacts involving H atoms are increased in line with the growing number of water molecules, while the fraction of O center dot center dot center dot N/N center dot center dot center dot O (NO2) contacts is nearly invariant. One may postulate the significance of the lone pair-pi-hole interactions to the aggregation of nitro species in solutions and their relevance for the sebsequent development of the solid-state patterns through nucleation.",2024
A new breakthrough in electrochemical synthesis of energetic materials: Constructing super heat-resistant explosives,"In this article, electrochemical synthesis methods were used to construct a series of novel heat-resistant energetic materials with a tetracyclic structure bridged by azo-bis (1,2,4-triazole). From a molecular structure perspective, the synthesized 1,2-bis(5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-diazene (H(4)AzTT) exhibits zwitterionic properties and can exhibit a tetravalent structure when used as a nitrogen rich anion. In terms of physicochemical properties, H(4)AzTT and its energetic salts (M-AzTT) exhibit excellent energy performance and thermal stability due to its high nitrogen content and large conjugated structure. Among them, K-4-AzTT 3H(2)O possess the highest decomposition temperature of 428 degrees C. Specifically, traditional chemical synthesis of tetracyclic structure may lead to ring breakage or by-products, while electrochemical synthesis methods are efficient and controllable, and allow for the direct synthesis of energetic salts (potassium, lithium, sodium, guanidine) by simply changing the electrolyte. Electrochemical testing and in situ ATR-SEIRAS analysis indicate that the electrochemical synthesis of M-AzTT precedes the OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction). Therefore, a high yield of 65 % and a high Faraday efficiency of 81.5 % at 1.7 V vs. RHE were achieved under alkaline conditions. In summary, this study not only constructs super heat-resistant energetic compounds, but also represents a new breakthrough in the field of electrochemical synthesis of energetic materials.",2024
Pioneering insights into the superior performance of titanium as a fuel in energetic materials,"In this work, for the first time, the spotlight was shined on in-depth understanding the reaction mechanism of nanoTi-based thermite. It was found that adding nanoTi into thermite can improve the combustion efficiency and lower the ignition temperature on Al based nanothermites. This experimental study aims at establishing the mechanisms driving this improvement by quantitatively analyzing the oxidation of Ti in contact with a strong oxidizer, such as CuO. Magnetron-sputtered CuO/Ti nanothermites were prepared, partially reacted and characterized using microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometric. Results show that similar to 70 % of heat of reaction of the Ti/CuO system is released within a single strong exotherm at 430 degrees C, thus confirming the early and fast Ti oxidation. High resolution electronic microscopy reveals that titania, terminal reaction oxide, is grown and propagates into the Ti layer, driven by the diffusion/reaction of oxygen atoms released by CuO at 300 degrees C. Spectroscopy measurements show that CuO/Ti redox reaction undergoes a two-step oxidation process: at 300 degrees C, Ti is first oxidized into TiO and further oxidized into crystalline TiO2 at 500 degrees C. This study confirms that Ti can be of great interest in addition or replacement of Al in nanothermites, for applications where it is desirable to lower the ignition temperature. Adding two CuO/Ti bilayers prior to the deposition of CuO/Al multilayers allows decreasing ignition time below the ms (200 mu s) against 15 ms without CuO/Ti. Also, a burn rate enhancement factor of x 3, and a reduction of the ignition delay by x 700 is obtained when replacing Al by Ti in standard CuO/Al multilayers.",2023
Comparative study on the thermal decomposition of structural isomers: Pyrazole and imidazole energetic materials,"Exploration of the thermal decay mechanisms of energetic skeletons supports the understanding of stability and energy release. Herein, we comparatively investigated the thermal decomposition of energetic isomers nitropyrazole and nitroimidazoles at high temperature and high density based on ReaxFF-lg reactive molecular dynamics simulations, which have not been fully understood. Results show that the initial decomposition reaction of nitropyrazole and nitroimidazole were triggered by the OH elimination as a result of intermolecular H-shift. And the N2 elimination plays a major role in the decomposition of pyrazoles, while the formation of hydrogen cyanide CHN is the main decomposition channel of imidazoles. Another important channel of their nitro derivatives is C-NO2 bond dissociation. At high density, the cleavage of C-NO2 bonds is inhibited, and the reactions between molecules are promoted, therefore the dimers are easier to produce. Detailed evolution yields of key intermediates, final gaseous products, and clusters are also presented to study the difference in the thermal decay of pyrazoles and imidazoles, as well as the effect of pressure. Overall, these thermolysis properties of nitropyrazole and nitroimidazole are expected to gain more knowledge to the diversity of thermal decomposition of energetic isomers.",2022
Crystal structure prediction of energetic materials and a twisted arene with Genarris and GAtor,"A molecular crystal structure prediction (CSP) workflow, based on the random structure generator, Genarris, and the genetic algorithm (GA), GAtor, is applied to the energetic materials 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3,5-triamine (TATB) and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3-diamine (DATB), and the chiral arene, 4,5-dimethylphenanthrene. The experimental structures of all three materials are successfully generated multiple times by both Genarris and GAtor, and ranked as the most stable structures by dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) methods. For 4,5-dimethylphenanthrene the evolutionary niching feature of GAtor helps find the experimental structure by penalizing the fitness of over-sampled regions and steering the GA to an under-explored basin. For DATB, a putative structure with a sheet packing motif, which is associated with reduced sensitivity, is found to be very close in energy to the experimental structure and could be a viable polymorph. Principal component analysis of atom-centered symmetry functions is used to compare the crystal structure landscapes of TATB and DATB. Genarris and GAtor exhibit robust performance for diverse targets with varied intermolecular interactions. This work demonstrates the potential of including CSP as a part of the energetic materials development process.",2021
Energetic-Materials-Driven Synthesis of Graphene-Encapsulated Tin Oxide Nanoparticles for Sodium-Ion Batteries,"By evenly mixing polytetrafluoroethylene-silicon energetic materials (PTFE-Si EMs) with tin oxide (SnO2) particles, we demonstrate a direct synthesis of graphene-encapsulated SnO2 (Gr-SnO2) nanoparticles through the self-propagated exothermic reaction of the EMs. The highly exothermic reaction of the PTFE-Si EMs released a huge amount of heat that induced an instantaneous temperature rise at the reaction zone, and the rapid expansion of the gaseous SiF4 product provided a high-speed gas flow for dispersing the molten particles into finer nanoscale particles. Furthermore, the reaction of the PTFE-NPs with Si resulted in a simultaneous synthesis of graphene that encapsulated the SnO2 nanoparticles in order to form the core-shell nanostructure. As sodium storage material, the graphene-encapsulated SnO2 nanoparticles exhibit a good cycling performance, superior rate capability, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.3%. This proves the effectiveness of our approach for the scalable synthesis of core-shell-structured graphene-encapsulated nanomaterials.",2021
The political frame of the European Union for mining of non-energetic raw materials,"The goal of the present applied raw material policy is to provide effective using of the domestic raw material base with regard to industrial, energetic, environmental policy, and local planning. The Slovakian raw material industry is in a breakthrough situation. Therefore, there is a task for all society to give vast effort to provide that also Slovakian raw material policy would begin to grow. In the presented contribution we search raw material policy in Slovakia from the systematic view, analyzing individual elements of the system relations with supplier-consumer, legislative, property, personal, economic, political and other relations in the frame of the system, as well as relations with its surroundings. We made a model of new raw material policy that defines systematically and objectively conditions, goals, and measurements and tools for filling of these goals with the aim to revitalize Slovakian raw material policy. Such a model could provide sustainability of the mining industry in the country.",2019
"Energetic Materials Based on the 5-Azido-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazolate Anion","This study presents the preparation of 5-azido-3-nitro-1H-1, 2,4-triazole (1) in both good yield and high purity, starting from commercially available chemicals in a three step synthesis. Furthermore, several metal and nitrogen-rich salts with sodium (3), potassium (4), cesium (5), silver (6), lead (7), ammonium (8), guanidinium (9), and aminoguanidinium (10) were prepared by simple acid-base reactions. All compounds were well characterized by various means, including vibrational (IR, Raman) and multinuclear (H-1, C-13, N-14, N-15) NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and DSC. Additionally the structure of 7 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The sensitivities towards various outer stimuli (impact, friction, electrostatic discharge) were determined according to BAM standards. The metal salts were tested as potential primary explosives utilizing various preliminary tests.",2013
Preparation of Al@FTCS/P(VDF-HFP) Composite Energetic Materials and Their Reaction Properties,"Strengthening the interfacial contact between the reactive components effectively boosts the energy release of energetic materials. In this study, we aimed to create a close-knit interfacial contact condition between aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) and Polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (P(VDF-HFP)) through hydrolytic adsorption and assembling 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-Perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (FTCS) on the surface of Al NPs. Leveraging hydrogen bonding between -CF and -CH and the interaction between C-F & ctdot;F-C groups, the adsorbed FTCS directly leads to the growth of the P(VDF-HFP) coating layer around the treated Al NPs, yielding Al@FTCS/P(VDF-HFP) energetic composites. In comparison with the ultrasonically processed Al/P(VDF-HFP) mixture, thermal analysis reveals that Al@FTCS/P(VDF-HFP) exhibits a 57 degrees C lower reaction onset temperature and a 1646 J/g increase in heat release. Associated combustion tests demonstrate a 52% shorter ignition delay, 62% shorter combustion time, and a 288% faster pressurization rate. These improvements in energetic characteristics stem from the reactivity activation of FTCS towards Al NPs by the etching effect to the surface Al2O3. Moreover, enhanced interfacial contact facilitated by the FTCS-directed growth of P(VDF-HFP) around Al NPs further accelerates the whole reaction process.",2024
Impact ignition of aluminum-teflon based energetic materials impregnated with nano-structured carbon additives,"The inclusion of graphene into composite energetic materials to enhance their performance is a new area of interest. Studies have shown that the addition of graphene significantly enhances the thermal transport properties of an energetic composite, but how graphene influences the composite's ignition sensitivity has not been studied. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of carbon additives in composite energetic material composed of aluminum and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon (TM)) on ignition sensitivity due to low velocity, drop weight impact. Specifically, three forms of carbon additives were investigated and selected based on different physical and structural properties: spherically shaped amorphous nano particles of carbon, cylindrically shaped multi walled carbon nanotubes, and sheet like graphene flakes. Results show an interesting trend: composites consisting of carbon nanotubes are significantly more sensitive to impact ignition and require the lowest ignition energy. In contrast, graphene is least sensitive to ignition exhibiting negligible reduction in ignition energy with low concentrations of graphene additive. While graphene does not significantly sensitize the energetic composite to ignition, graphene does, however, result in greater overall reactivity as observed through images of the reaction. The enhanced thermal transport properties of graphene containing composites may promote greater energy transport once ignited, but those properties do not also increase ignition sensitivity. These results and the understanding of the structural arrangement of particles within a composite as a key parameter affecting impact ignition sensitivity will have an impact on the safe handling and use of composite energetic materials.

Ultrafast synthesis of graphene nanosheets encapsulated Si nanoparticles ,"Encapsulating silicon particles in conductive layers has proven to be an effective route to retain the high capacity of silicon during cycling. Here, through a core-shell structural design of silicon-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) energetic materials, we demonstrate a large-scale top-down approach for directly obtaining graphene nanosheets encapsulated Si nanoparticles (GrSiNPs) using micrometer-sized PTFE and Si particles as low-cost starting materials. Upon deflagration, high temperature and high pressure of the exothermic reaction between PTFE and Si lead to the fragmentation of the Si core into nanoscale particles, during which the concomitant coating of the Si nanoparticles with graphene nanosheets is achieved. Repeated cycling at a current density of 400 mA g(-1) for 6 months, the GrSiNPs demonstrate a high specific capacity of 1613 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles and the average Coulombic efficiency is 101 +/- 2%. Our study provides a promising route to the mass production of core-shell structured graphene-Si nanocomposites for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",2019
"Trifluoromethyl- or pentafluorosulfanyl-substituted poly-1,2,3-triazole compounds as dense stable energetic materials","4-(Trifluoromethyl-or pentafluorosulfanyl)-substituted mono- and poly-1,2,3-triazole compounds were synthesized using Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar azide and fluorinated alkyne cycloaddition reactions. This methodology gave highly regioselective 4-substituted 1,2,3-triazole products. The SF5-containing materials (1b-6b) exhibit higher densities and more favorable detonation properties relative to their analogs with a CF3 substituent (1a-6a). Fluorinated triazene-(1,2,3-triazole) compounds (5a, 6a, 5b, 6b) have the most useful detonation properties based on calculations (Cheetah 5.0), and are comparable to those of TNT. These compounds are thermally stable (> 270 degrees C) except for 1b, and are insensitive to impact. All of the new compounds were fully characterized via elemental, spectral (F-19, H-1, C-13 NMR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. Compounds 3a and 4a were also structured using single crystal X-ray diffraction.",2011
 investigation of the dynamic response of energetic materials using IMPULSE at the Advanced Photon Source,"The mechanical and chemical response of energetic materials is controlled by a convolution of deformation mechanisms that span length scales and evolve during impact. Traditional methods use continuum measurements to infer the microstructural response whereas advances in synchrotron capabilities and diagnostics are providing new, unique opportunities to interrogate materials in real time and in situ. Experiments have been performed on a new gas-gun system (IMPact system for Ultrafast Synchrotron Experiments) using single X-ray bunch phase contrast imaging (PCI) and Laue diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The low absorption of molecular materials maximizes x-ray beam penetration, allowing measurements in transmission using the brilliance currently available at APS Sector 32. The transmission geometry makes it possible to observe both average lattice response and spatially heterogeneous, continuum response (1-4 um spatial resolution over similar to 2 x 2 mm area, 80 ps exposure, 153 ns frame-rate) in energetic materials ranging from single crystals to plastic-bonded composites. The current work describes our progress developing and using these diagnostics to observe deformation mechanisms relevant to explosives and the first experiments performed with explosives on IMPULSE at APS.",2014
Thinking Outside the Energetic Box: Stabilizing and Greening High-Energy Materials with Reticular Chemistry.,"ConspectusReticular chemistry has provided intriguing opportunities for systematically designing porous materials with different pores by adjusting the building blocks. Among them, framework materials have demonstrated outstanding performance for the design of new functional materials used in a broad range of fields, including energetic materials. Energetic materials are widely used for rockets, satellites, mining, and tunneling. In terms of energetic materials, explosophores and nitrogen-rich heterocycles are fundamental building blocks for high-energy compounds. However, the traditional strategy of synthesizing HEDMs (high energy density materials) at the molecular level has faced the long-term challenge of balancing energy and stability. Inspired by reticular chemistry, nitrogen-rich heterocycles offer diverse nitrogen sites for designing diversified coordination interactions. Ionic bond interactions exist in a wide range of energetic salts. Furthermore, most metastable explosophores, e.g., nitro, nitramino, and amino groups, can form strong hydrogen-bonding networks. Based on these noncovalent interactions (such as coordination, ionic, and/or hydrogen bonds (HBs)) and/or covalent interactions can determine intermolecular packing/linkage of the energetic fuel and oxidizer components, reticular chemistry provides a new platform evolving from single-molecular design to various energetic frameworks (E of the energetic frameworks with superior comprehensive properties. For example, to achieve coordination with metals or introduce sufficient hydrogen bond donor/acceptor structural units, the host structure of energetic framework materials usually contains less oxygen-rich substituents such as nitro, so the host molecules of the framework, F) at the crystal level, which can enhance the integrated stabilities of EFs.Along with growing concerns about the environment and safety issues, considerable effort has been devoted to pursuing environmentally friendly and insensitive energetic materials. The newly emerging EFs are conducive to introducing explosophores into a green chemical pathway. Benefiting from these cross-disciplinary achievements, taming metastable energetic molecules in specific porous frameworks is a green strategy to desensitize energetic materials while concomitantly retaining excellent energetic properties, which has become one of the most forward and promising investigations. In the past decade, EFs have achieved further results in stabilizing and greening energetic materials using HBs, covalent bonds, and alkaline earth metal-involving coordination bonds to avoid heavy metal toxicity and to employ halogen-free oxidizers. Because this field is still expanding rapidly, it is of great value for researchers and possible users of the work to be able to view all the progress.Through this Account, we intend that more readers will become knowledgeable about EFs, including their definition, history, synthesis, properties, and possible applications. The aim of this Account is to present the latest advances in EFs in recent years and to offer a perspective on the future direction of this field.",p-12
OIL SHALE FRACTURING EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES GENERATED BY PLASMA-IGNITED ENERGETIC MATERIALS EXPLOSION,"Shock wave tests on oil shale samples were carried out in water medium by using the composite electro-thermal chemical explosion method through the shock wave generator, and strain measurement system was also introduced, and the cracking effect of energetic materials and copper wire to oil shale was analyzed. In the process, 1# oil shale sample was tested with energetic rods containing different mass of energetic materials, while 2# oil shale sample was tested with 0.3 mm copper wire explosion. The results show that the 0.3mm copper wire explosion has a small cracking effect, while the energetic rods have a much stronger cracking effect on the oil shale, and the impact pressure and the process impulse of the energetic mixture deflagration which produced strong shock wave are positively related to its mass. It also suggested that the strain time curve during the cracking process is the comprehensive effect of the strong shock wave produced by the copper wire and the energetic materials' explosion. What's more, the impact wave effect is mainly emerging the splitting failure, and a small amount of shear failure is mainly concentrated in the interlayer. Moreover, under the impact of shock waves, the physical properties of oil and gas reservoirs are changed, and its permeability is obviously enhanced which is helpful for the analysis and diffusion of oil and gas. The reduction of the mechanical strength parameters proves that the shock wave plays a definite certain damage to the physical structure of the reservoir.

Functionalization of fluorodinitroethylamino derivatives based on azole: a new family of insensitive energetic materials,"In this work, four energetic N-fluorodinitroethyl-substituted aminoazoles 6, 8, 10 and 11, as well as nitramine 7 and 9 (the N-nitration products of 6 and 8, respectively) are synthesized. All compounds are characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR, elemental analysis, as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); what's more, the structures of compounds 6, 9 and 10 are confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, the sensitivities of 6-10 are measured by standard impact and friction tests. The results indicate that the reported compounds are less sensitive than TNT. The detonation performance based on the calculated heat of formation and experimental densities illustrates that most of the compounds might be of interest for applications as insensitive energetic materials, especially for compounds 7 and 9 (D = 8835 and 8896 m s(-1); P = 35.6 and 36.4 GPa).",2018
Standoff Detection of Highly Energetic Materials Using Laser-Induced Thermal Excitation of Infrared Emission,"A laser-mediated methodology for standoff infrared detection of threat chemicals is described in this article. Laser-induced thermal emissions (LITE) from vibrationally excited residue of highly energetic material (HEM) deposited on substrates were detected remotely. Telescope-based Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on substrates containing small amounts of HEM at surface concentrations of 5-200 mu g/cm(2). Target substrates of various thicknesses were heated remotely using a carbon dioxide laser, and their mid-infrared (mid-IR), thermally stimulated emission spectra were recorded after heating. The telescope was configured from reflective optical elements to minimize emission losses in the mid-IR frequencies. Spectral replicas were acquired at distances from 4 to 64 m using an FT-IR interferometer at 4 cm(-1) resolution. The laser power, laser exposure times, and acquisition time of the FT-IR interferometer were adjusted to improve the detection and identification of samples. The advantages of increasing the thermal emission were easily observed in the results. The signal intensities were proportional to the thickness of the coated surface (a function of the surface concentration) as well as the laser power and laser exposure time. The limits of detection obtained for the HEM studied were 140-21 mu g/cm(2) at 4 m. Detection was achieved at 64 m for a surface concentration of 200 mu g/cm(2).",2015
Direct quantum mechanical simulations of shocked energetic materials supporting future force insensitive munitions requirements,"Quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are used to study dynamic behavior of shocked polymeric nitrogen, a novel energetic material. We report results on system sizes in excess of 3, 000 atoms. Such calculations on system sizes within the 1,000 atom range remain problematic using standard implementations of DFT. We evaluate the feasibility of using several available DFT codes for this work through comparison of scalability and resource requirements. In this study, we utilize a recently developed highly-scalable localized orbital DFT code, CP2K, designed to treat large systems. Scaling and performance benchmarks of the CP2K on several Department of Defense (DoD) high performance computing (HPC) computers are presented for a variety of system sizes and shapes. Additionally, we report preliminary calculations on the conventional explosive nitromethane. In those calculations in excess of 3,500, atoms are treated.",2007
Assembly of thermostable fused compounds with oxidizers for laser-ignited energetic materials,"Addressing the delicate balance between the energy and sensitivity of energetic materials has been a prominent research focus. Here, 7,8-dinitropyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazine-2,4-diamine (ICM-104) is assembled with oxidizer ions through coulombic interactions, achieving an increase in energy while maintaining relatively low sensitivity. X-ray diffraction results indicated that the two energetic salts have a layered structure different from that of ICM-104, and have high densities of 1.89 and 1.95 g cm(-3), which are higher than most other energetic salts. Both have excellent thermal detonation velocity (8813 and 8857 m s(-1)) and detonation pressure (33.2 and 35.7 GPa), higher than 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) (D: 8795 m s(-1), P: 34.9 GPa). Moreover, compound 1 exhibits low mechanical sensitivities (FS > 360 N, IS > 40 J), which has great potential as an insensitive energetic material. In addition, two energetic salts have favorable laser-ignited combustion and propulsion performances, which provide new strategies for the formulation design of solid propellants.",2024
Theoretical insights into the role of regiochemistry in thermal stability regulation of energetic materials,"In this study, the regioisomerism impact on the thermal stability of two pairs of regioisomers with obvious deviation in decomposition temperature has been thoroughly investigated. The initial decomposition mechanism results indicate that the large gaps in decomposition temperature of both pairs are caused by the change of primary initial decomposition paths. Despite with same molecular formula, the regioisomers may decompose through totally different way, and lead to a sharp change in decomposition temperature, hence, making the regioisomerism be capable of improving the thermal stability of energetic materials.",2022
Regulating safety and energy release of energetic materials by manipulation of molybdenum disulfide phase,"Designing advanced component for synergistically achieving the safety performance and energy releasing of widely studied energetic materials (EMs) is of far-reaching significance in composite solid propellants. Herein, molybdenum disulfide with high-active 1T phase (1T-MoS2) was engineered by a phase-manipulation strategy through chemical Li-intercalation from its original state (2H-MoS2). The as-prepared 1T-MoS2 was used for the improved safety and decomposition performances of two typical EMs (ammonium perchlorate: AP and 1,3,5,7-tetranittro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane: HMX) in propellants. Lubricant 1T-MoS2 endowed considerable advances in safety performance of EMs, with remarkably reduced the impact and friction sensitivity. Besides, fast energy releasing performance with visibly lower activation energy was realized for AP@1T-MoS2 and HMX@1TMoS(2). In addition, large decomposition heats were simultaneously achieved. Computational studies disclosed this improvement could be attributed to the multi-coupling effect arising from the promoted electron transfer capability, strong affiliations of catalyst/burning products and the abundant actives sites of 1T-MoS2 phase. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in the synergistical design of safe and fast-decomposed AP and HMX complex for solid propellants.",2021
On the importance of reducing the energetic and material demands of electrical energy storage,"Two prominent low-carbon energy resources, wind and sunlight, depend on weather. As the percentage of electricity supply from these sources increases, grid operators will need to employ strategies and technologies, including energy storage, to balance supply with demand. We quantify energy and material resource requirements for currently available energy storage technologies: lithium ion (Li-ion), sodium sulfur (NaS) and lead-acid (PbA) batteries; vanadium redox (VRB) and zinc-bromine (ZnBr) flow batteries; and geologic pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES). By introducing new concepts, including energy stored on invested (ESOI), we map research avenues that could expedite the development and deployment of grid-scale energy storage. ESOI incorporates several storage attributes instead of isolated properties, like efficiency or energy density. Calculations indicate that electrochemical storage technologies will impinge on global energy supplies for scale up - PHS and CAES are less energy intensive by 100 fold. Using ESOI we show that an increase in electrochemical storage cycle life by tenfold would greatly relax energetic constraints for grid-storage and improve cost competitiveness. We find that annual material resource production places tight limits on Li-ion, VRB and PHS development and loose limits on NaS and CAES. This analysis indicates that energy storage could provide some grid flexibility but its build up will require decades. Reducing financial cost is not sufficient for creating a scalable energy storage infrastructure. Most importantly, for grid integrated storage, cycle life must be improved to improve the scalability of battery technologies. As a result of the constraints on energy storage described here, increasing grid flexibility as the penetration of renewable power generation increases will require employing several additional techniques including demand-side management, flexible generation from base-load facilities and natural gas firming.",2013
Integrating Al with NiO nano honeycomb to realize an energetic material on silicon substrate,"Nano energetic materials offer improved performance in energy release, ignition, and mechanical properties compared to their bulk or micro counterparts. In this study, the authors propose an approach to synthesize an Al/NiO based nano energetic material which is fully compatible with a microsystem. A two-dimensional NiO nano honeycomb is first realized by thermal oxidation of a Ni thin film deposited onto a silicon substrate by thermal evaporation. Then the NiO nano honeycomb is integrated with an Al that is deposited by thermal evaporation to realize an Al/NiO based nano energetic material. This approach has several advantages over previous investigations, such as lower ignition temperature, enhanced interfacial contact area, reduced impurities and Al oxidation, tailored dimensions, and easier integration into a microsystem to realize functional devices. The synthesized Al/NiO based nano energetic material is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry.",2009
Physical and chemical characterization of energetic nano-materials via theoretical modeling and spectrochemical analysis,"The present work aims to characterize structural, morphological, and chemical properties of energetic nanoparticles with the aid of theoretical and experimental studies. The first part develops a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to study the effect of particle-particle collision and exothermic coalescence events on primary particle sizes in a growing nano-aerosol. The results indicate that under certain process conditions, two coalescing nanoparticles can release sufficient energy and substantially exceed the background gas temperature. This increases atomic diffusivities and hastens the coalescence process. Typical results for silicon and titania nanoparticles show that increasing volume loading and decreasing pressure enhances non-isothermal sintering rates and produces larger primary particles. These results suggest the use of process parameters heretofore not considered in tailoring the microstructure of nanoparticles. The second part develops a hybrid nodal model to study the effect of size-dependent surface tension on nanoparticle evolution during gas-particle conversions. It uses chemical reaction-based formalism to compute nuclei formation rates as opposed to the commonly used kinetic homogeneous nucleation expression based on steady-state assumption and capillarity approximation (size-independent constant surface tension). The results indicate that although quasi-steady state assumption is reasonable, the capillarity approximation significantly over-predicts particle sizes. On the experimental side, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is used for quantitative estimation of elemental composition of nano-aerosols using an internal standard. The methodology uses time-resolved atomic emission spectra and plasma temperatures to calculate species densities calibrated with background gas densities under the same experimental conditions. The method is applied to determine the extent of oxidative coating on aluminum nanoparticles. The aim is to understand the reactivity of nano-materials and the stability of passivation coatings, such as metal oxides. The use of background gas as the internal standard mitigates the need for material standards and can be extended to the characterization of other multi-component aerosol systems. This thesis also presents laser ablation technique to produce aluminum nanoparticles. Using various laser fluences, Al nanoparticles were generated with a production rate of 4–4.2 mg/hr having a size range of 17–75 nm and number concentrations of 3 × 10 5 –3 × 10 6 #/cc.",2005
Pressure-Dependent Decomposition Kinetics of the Energetic Material HMX up to 3.6 GPa,"The effect of pressure on the global thermal decomposition rate of the energetic material HMX was studied. HMX was precompressed in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and heated at various rates. The parent species population was monitored as a function of time and temperature using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Global decomposition rates were determined by fitting the fraction reacted to the extended-Prout-Tompkins nucleation-growth model and the Friedman isoconversional method. The results of these experiments and analysis indicate that pressure accelerates the decomposition at low-to-moderate pressures (i.e., between ambient pressure and 0.1 GPa) and decelerates the decomposition at higher pressures, The decomposition acceleration is attributed to pressure-enhanced autocatalysis, whereas the deceleration at high pressures is attributed to pressure-inhibiting bond homolysis step(s), which would result in an increase in volume. These results indicate that both the beta- and delta-polymorphs of HMX are sensitive to pressure in the thermally induced decomposition kinetics.",2009
"Fabrication, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation of Thermally Stable [5,6]-Fused Bicyclic Energetic Materials","In recent decades, there has been considerable interest in investigating advanced energetic materials characterized by high stability and favorable energetic properties. Nevertheless, reconciling the conflicting balance between high energy and the insensitivity of such materials through traditional approaches, which involve integrating fuel frameworks and oxidizing groups into an organic molecule, presents significant challenges. In this study, we employed a promising method to fabricate high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) through the intermolecular assembly of variously substituted purines with a high-energy oxidant. Purines are abundant in nature and are readily available. A series of advanced energetic materials with a good balance between energy and sensitivity were prepared by the simple and effective self-assembly of purines with high-energy oxidants. Notably, these compounds exhibit incredibly improved crystal densities (1.80-2.00 g cm-3) and good detonation performance (D: 7072-8358 m s-1; P: 19.82-34.56 GPa). In comparison to RDX, these self-assembled energetic materials exhibit reduced mechanical sensitivities and enhanced thermal stabilities. Compounds 1-5 demonstrate both high energy and low sensitivity, indicating that self-assembly represents a straightforward and effective approach for developing advanced energetic materials with a balanced combination of energy and safety. Moreover, this study offers an avenue for synthesizing energetic materials based on naturally occurring compounds assembled through intermolecular attractions, thereby achieving a balance between energy and sensitivity along with versatile functionality.",
"3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO): high explosive insensitive energetic material","5-Nitro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (NTO) also known as nitrotriazolone is a low sensitive and thermally stable high energetic material containing a heterocyclic ring. NTO can be used to substitute highly sensitive high energetic materials that are thermally and photochemically less stable. This review provides a survey of various routes utilized for the synthesis of NTO, changes in its morphology by varying solvent systems, characterization, decomposition mechanisms, and use of metal oxides and other catalysts to enhance or diminish the thermal decomposition temperature of NTO. The review covers research on the synthesis, thermal decomposition mechanism, and catalytic effect of NTO additives from past four decades (1987-2021).",2021
Study on the Methods Evaluating the Stability of a New Type of Energetic Material,"171 propellant is a new type of energetic material, extensive research indicates that the traditional methods evaluating the stability of this propellant are unsuitable. So in this article, the stability of this material was studied by aging test, methyl-violet test and gas phase chromatography test.

"Thermal behavior and decomposition mechanism of three nitrate energetic materials: TNNP, TNOP and DNHM","Thermal decomposition of three new energetic materials,5-nitratomethyl-1,3,5-trinitrohexahydropyrimidine (TNNP), 5-methylnitrate-1,5-dinitrooxazine (TNOP) and 1,3-dinitrohexahydropyrimidine-5-nitrate (DNHM) was investigated by using TG-DTG, DSC, TG-FTIR, and TG-MS techniques. Results show that DNHM is more stable than TNNP and TNOP, while the decomposition process of TNNP and TNOP is more complicated than that of DNHM. TNNP starts to decompose at around 176.1 degrees C and the peak temperature is 187.9 degrees C with decomposition heat of - 1157.9 J center dot g- 1 at the heating rate of 2.5 degrees C center dot min- 1. In comparison, the onset temperature and heat release of TNOP and DNHM are respectively 172.3 degrees C, - 486.5 J center dot g- 1 and 180.8 degrees C, - 1947.6 J center dot g- 1 at the same condition. The first decomposition step of TNNP follows first-order kinetics (F1) based on DSC data, while the decomposition of TNOP and DNHM follows the random chain scission model (L2) and the phase boundary controlled reaction (contracting area) model (R2), respectively. The main products of these three compounds during the decomposition process are N2, CO2, N2O, CH2O and NO from TG-FTIR and TG-MS.",2022
Exploding wire preparation of core-shell aluminum-silicon nanoparticles and characterization as energetic material,"Novel aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) nanoparticles (11 similar to 12 wt.% silicon) with core-shell structure were designed and prepared by electric wire explosion in argon atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the structure and composition of Al-Si powders. Oxygen bomb calorimeter was used to obtain the combustion heat released, whereas thermo-gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) were used to study the thermal oxidation process. Results showed that the particle size of Al-Si powders with d(50) of 311.8 nm was mainly in the nanometer range, although some large particles of several micrometers were observed. The nanoparticles had a typical ""core-shell"" structure. The shell consisted of silicon chips and aluminum oxides, whereas core is mainly composed of silicon frameworks filled with aluminum. TG-DSC results showed that the thermal oxidation reaction of Al-Si nanoparticles in the air proceeded in three stages. The first stage involves the slow oxidation reaction, whereas in the second step there is a violent oxidation reaction of Al, which started at about 535.5 degrees C The third step involves the mild oxidation of Al and Si. The weight gain was 72%. The oxygen bomb calorimeter tests showed that the heat release of Al-Si powders was higher than that of pure nano-Al powders. Therefore, the Al-Si nanoparticles prepared in the present work can be considered as a promising candidate in composite energetic materials such as explosives and propellants.",2021
Pentacycloundecane (PCUD)-Based Cage Frameworks as Potential Energetic Materials: Syntheses and Characterization,"A new variety of cage frameworks containing pentacycloundecane (PCUD) were synthesized. These compounds contain azide and triazole units. Four new cage frameworks were designed and constructed starting from easily accessible starting materials such as 2,3-dimethylhydroquinone, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, and dicyclopentadiene using [2+2] photocycloaddition as the key step. The structures of these symmetrical cage bis-azide and cage bis-triazole compounds have been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. DFT analysis at different levels of theory were used to optimize the geometries and compute the heats of formation of the title compounds. Their propulsive and explosive properties were also calculated using suitable computational methods. The thermodynamic stability of the title compounds was theoretically analysed based on their bond dissociation energies. The thermal stability was evaluated by TGA-coupled FTIR analysis.",2020
Combustion of energetic iodine-rich coordination polymer - Engineering of new biocidal materials,"Development and molecular engineering of new highly-efficient energetic biocidal materials is a significant challenge and of a great importance. Until now this type of materials included mostly halogen-rich nano-thermites and iodine-rich organic materials. So far, no energetic coordination polymers were reported as precursors for combustion-generated biocidal agents. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the synthesis of uniquely-structured three-dimensional energetic coordination polymer (ECP3) containing Zn metal centers and iodine- and nitrogen-rich bridging ligand (2). Upon its combustion, ECP3 is capable of generating gaseous reactive iodine species and elemental iodine-coated ZnO particles. ECP3 presents a novel approach for the design of efficient biocidal agents.",2018
"Pyrazole-Tetrazole Hybrid with Trinitromethyl, Fluorodinitromethyl, or (Difluoroamino)dinitromethyl Groups: High-Performance Energetic Materials","High-nitrogen-content compounds have attracted great scientific interest and technological importance because of their unique energy content, and they find diverse applications in many fields of science and technology. Understanding of structure-property relationship trends and how to modify them is of paramount importance for their further improvement. Herein, the installation of oxygen-rich modules, C(NO2)(3), C(NO2)(2)F, or C(NO2)(2)NF2, into an endothermic framework, that is, the combination of a nitropyrazole unit and tetrazole ring, is used as a way to design novel energetic compounds. Density, oxygen balance, and enthalpy of formation are enhanced by the presence of these oxygen-containing units. The structures of all compounds were confirmed by XRD. For crystal packing analysis, it is proposed to use new criterion, (OED), that can serve as a measure of the tightness of molecular packing upon crystal formation. Overall, the materials show promising detonation and propulsion parameters.",2018
Sensitivity of energetic materials to effects of electrostatic discharge - effect of distance between electrodes,"In the course of manufacturing of energetic materials (EM) and their subsequent processing, transport, storage and use of their working capacity, these materials are exposed to various risks. Risk situations arise from, among others, exposition of EM's to activation effects of electrostatic discharge. The measure of resistance of EM to effects of discharge is tested by means of instruments of various types, using different methodological approaches, which introduces into this discipline a certain level of difficulty of comparisons of the test data obtained from such different tests. The obtained data depend, inter alia, upon the type of test chamber, the condition and grain size of the sample tested. The submitted methodological paper is focused on investigation of the effect of distance of the flat contact testing electrodes upon the resulting test data evaluating the sensitivity of pyrotechnic compositions containing Pb3O4 as the oxidant.",2010
Molecular geometry structure and thermodynamic properties of high energetic nitrogen materials with quantum chemistry,"High energetic nitrogen materials (HENM) has not only great power and appropriate sensitivity but also keeps extraordinary stability under shock, impact and thermal initiation conditions, however, its stable molecular structure and reactive hazard have not been clearly identified. In this paper, the molecular geometry structure of C12H10N6 was optimized, and its bond length, bond angles are calculated with density functional theories. Frequency analysis is also performed at the B3LYP/6-31G level to identify the molecular structures and the local minimum structures. It is confirmed that C12H10N6 has two stable structures can be served as promising high energy density materials",2007
Application of Lee-Tarver Model for Energetic Materials Safety Assessment Utilized in Aerospace Applications,"Energetic materials, essential for rocket propulsion, play a crucial role in aerospace systems. These materials lack sufficient safety assessments and pose significant risks to life and infrastructure. The slow progress in this field is hindered by prohibitively high experimental costs and the inherently destructive nature of these experiments. This study aimed to evaluate modeling-based safety assessments, primarily utilizing the Lee-Tarver model. It specifically addressed the threat posed by shaped charges during transportation. Experimental analyses employed 50 mm JH-2 shaped charges, targeting RDX-based JH-2 formulation, since RDX is widely used in various rocket motor propellant formulations. TNT was also used to enhance the validation of the Lee-Tarver model findings. Various logistical configurations were explored, testing steel container walls ranging from 10 mm thickness to reinforced walls of 50 mm, 60 mm, and 65 mm steel. Comparative analysis with experiments reinforced the accuracy of the Lee-Tarver model's numerical predictions. Both simulations and experiments affirmed that a 65 mm steel protection suffices for the safe transportation of RDX-based JH-2 formulations and TNT within a 10 mm storage box in logistical setups. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the Lee-Tarver model's reliability for most energetic materials safety assessments, while acknowledging certain limitations.",2024
"Ab Initio Crystal Structure Prediction of the Energetic Materials LLM-105, RDX, and HMX","Crystalstructure prediction (CSP) is performed for theenergetic materials LLM-105 and & alpha;-RDX as well as the & alpha;and & beta; conformational polymorphs of HMX using the genetic algorithmGAtor and its associated random structure generator Genarris. Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is performed for theenergeticmaterials (EMs) LLM-105 and & alpha;-RDX, as well as the & alpha; and & beta; conformational polymorphs of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane(HMX), using the genetic algorithm (GA) code, GAtor, and its associatedrandom structure generator, Genarris. Genarris and GAtor successfullygenerate the experimental structures of all targets. GAtor'ssymmetric crossover scheme, where the space group symmetries of parentstructures are treated as genes inherited by offspring, is found tobe particularly effective. However, conducting several GA runs withdifferent settings is still important for achieving diverse samplingsof the potential energy surface. For LLM-105 and & alpha;-RDX, theexperimental structure is ranked as the most stable, with all of thedispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) methods usedhere. For HMX, the & alpha; form was persistently ranked as more stablethan the & beta; form, in contrast to experimental observations, evenwhen correcting for vibrational contributions and thermal expansion.This may be attributed to insufficient accuracy of dispersion-inclusiveDFT methods or to kinetic effects not considered here. In general,the ranking of some putative structures is found to be sensitive tothe choice of the DFT functional and the dispersion method. For LLM-105,GAtor generates a putative structure with a layered packing motif,which is desirable thanks to its correlation with low sensitivity.Our results demonstrate that CSP is a useful tool for studying theubiquitous polymorphism of EMs and shows promise of becoming an integralpart of the EM development pipeline.",2023
Propagation of combustion waves in the shell-core energetic materials with external heat losses,"In this paper, the properties and stability of combustion waves propagating in the composite solid energetic material of the shell-core type are numerically investigated within the one-dimensional diffusive-thermal model with heat losses to the surroundings. The flame speed is calculated as a function of the parameters of the model. The boundaries of stability are determined in the space of parameters by solving the linear stability problem and direct integration of the governing non-stationary equations. The results are compared with the characteristics of the combustion waves in pure solid fuel. It is demonstrated that a stable travelling combustion wave solution can exist for the parameters of the model for which the flame front propagation is unstable in pure solid fuel and it can propagate several times faster even in the presence of significant heat losses.",2017
"Polynitro Containing Energetic Materials based on Carbonyldiisocyanate and 2,2-Dinitropropane-1,3-diol","New polynitro compounds containing a carbonyl biscarbamate moiety derived from the precursor carbonyldiisocyanate were synthesized.

A simple procedure for calculating condensed phase heat of formation of nitroaromatic energetic materials.,"A simple procedure has been introduced for calculating solid and liquid heats of formation of nitroaromatic energetic compounds. This model assumes that the heat of formation of a nitroaromatic compound of composition C(a)H(b)N(c)O(d) can be expressed as a new correlation which depends on elemental composition and various structural and special functional group parameters. Condensed phase heats of formation predicted using the method described herein and complicated quantum mechanical computations [B.M. Rice, J. Hare, Thermochem. Acta 384 (2002) 377] have a root mean square (rms) deviation of 5.9 and 11.1 kcal/mol for 19 well-known organic nitroaromatic compounds. Predicted heats of formation for 29 polycyclic nitroaromatic energetic compounds have a rms deviation from experiment of 10.6 kcal/mol. The results show that the present method gives comparable prediction respect to the other methods such as complex quantum mechanical computation.",g-25
Structure and Stability of Aromatic Nitrogen Heterocycles Used in the Field of Energetic Materials,"Understanding the stabilization of nitrogen heterocycles is critical in the field of energetic materials and calls for innovative knowledge of nitrogen aromatics. Herewith, we report for the first time that nitrogen lone pair electron (NLPE) delocalization in five-membered nitrogen heterocycles creates a second sigma-aromaticity in addition to the prototypical pi-aromaticity. The NLPE delocalization and the attendant dual-aromaticity are enhanced as more carbon atoms in the ring are substituted by unsaturated nitrogen atoms. The presence of adjacent nitrogen atoms in the ring can enhance the aromaticity of the nitrogen heterocycles and improve in-crystal intermolecular binding strength but will decrease the firmness of the individual molecular architecture. Notably, such sigma-aromaticity is not present in six-membered nitrogen heterocycles, probably due to the longer bonds and broader regions of their rings; therefore, six-membered heterocycles present overall lower aromaticity than five-membered heterocycles. This work brings new knowledge to nitrogen aromatics and is expected to inspire broad interest in the chemistry community.",2020
Probing the evolution in catalytic graphitization of biomass-based materials for enduring energetic applications,"The continued reliance on carbon-based materials derived from fossil fuels exacerbates environmental challenges, demanding alternative cleaner energy sources. Within the realm of thermo-energy processes, graphitization holds a pivotal role in generating graphite structures featuring unparalleled conductivity, strength, and heat resistance. Nonetheless, traditional graphitization processes hinge on ultra-high temperatures surpassing 3000 degrees C, which poses significant challenges in terms of energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and scalability. Catalytic graphitization emerges as a transformative solution, enabling the reduction of both temperature requirements and carbon emissions. Harnessing catalysts derived from diverse sources ensures the efficient transformation of amorphous carbon into crystalline graphite. Interestingly, biomass shines as a promising and renewable feedstock for graphitization due to its accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. It is noteworthy that catalysts play a dual role in lowering graphitization temperatures and enhancing carbon rearrangement when integrated into biomass-derived materials. The generated bio-graphite from catalytic processing of biomass finds multifaceted applications in energy storage, batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells, driven by its unique structure and exceptional conductivity. However, the diverse nature of raw materials and processing conditions employed in various studies poses challenges to the standardization of the process. This literature analysis seeks to bridge the gap by exploring the potential of biomass-based materials as feedstock for catalytic graphitization, paving the way for sustainable and efficient energetic applications in the ever-evolving energy landscape. Catalytic processing of biomass and its derivatives to produce graphitizable materials offers a transformative method for converting renewable resources into bio-energy and valuable carbon-based materials.",2024
Impact sensitivities of energetic materials derived from easy-to-compute ,"New procedures to estimate the impact sensitivity of energetic materials are derived from an earlier semiempirical model correlating the drop weight impact height h(50) to the rate constant k for the propagation of the decomposition process, assumed to be the limiting step. The new models are obtained by removing step by step the empiricism in the evaluation of k. We end up with a full ab initio expression for this constant in terms of theoretical activation energies and prefactors. The resulting model casts doubt on a previously introduced assumption regarding the temperature at the reaction front. Moreover, it questions possible interpretations of semiempirical estimates. A systematic comparison against alternative methods shows that although somewhat less accurate than its earlier semiempirical version, this ab initio model shows a predictive value similar to heavily parameterized approaches. The results imply that the decomposition kinetics accounts for at least 50% of the variation in the logarithms of drop height data.",2023
Investigation on deformation of DP600 steel sheets in electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming,"Electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming (ETEF) is a high-speed manufacturing process, which utilizes the chemical energy released by energetic materials (EMs) triggered by underwater wire discharge to plastically shape metals. ETEF is not fully understood, particularly in research on the discharge characteristics of energetic materials triggered by metal wires and the deformation process of metal sheets. The above two problems were investigated in this paper using experimentation and numerical simulation. For the pulse discharge characteristics, the peak values of voltage and current were reduced during the triggering process of energetic materials, and the triggering energy consumption of energetic materials was quantified to be about 200 J. The matching parameters of different capacitor-voltage devices may be insensitive to triggering the energy release of energetic materials. The maximum major strain and thinning rate of the bulged specimen under ETEF conditions were significantly reduced when compared to the quasi-static specimen with the same bulging height, and the specimen's deformation uniformity and strain distribution were improved. The simulation results showed that the addition of energetic materials significantly improved the plastic strain energy of the blank. The deformation of the blank in ETEF can be divided into two stages: the initial chemical energy action stage and the inertia action stage. The bulging height of sheet metal increased by nearly 301% in inertia action stage, accounting for 80% of the total deformation time, and the effective plastic strain distribution was more uniform.",2022
"Chelating Energetic Material Nickel Semicarbazide 2,4,6-Trinitroresorcinol: Synthesis, Structure, and Thermal Behavior","Through a one-pot reaction of NiCO(3)2Ni(OH)(2)H2O, aminourea hydrochloride (SCZHCl) and 2,4,6-trinitroresorcinol (TNR), a halogen-free and lead-free chelating energetic material (CEM) [Ni(SCZ)(3)]TNR was synthesized. We confirmed the structure of [Ni(SCZ)(3)]TNR by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis. The complex is triclinic with P (I) over bar (2)/n space group. Cell parameters are: a = 1.04008(17) nm, b = 1.3719(2) nm, c = 1.4897(2) nm, V = 2.0337(6) nm(3), Z = 4. The central nickel atom is six-coordinate with three oxygen atoms of carbonyl groups and three terminal nitrogen atoms of the hydrazine groups from three SCZs to form a distorted octahedron. Differential scanning calorimetry and analysis applied to assess the thermal decomposition behavior. The DSC curve with a linear heating rate of 10 degrees Cmin(-1) shows that [Ni(SCZ)(3)]TNR is thermally stable with one exothermic peak temperatures of 78.8 degrees C and two exothermic peak temperatures of 216.8 degrees C and 308.1 degrees C. The kinetic parameters were obtained by non-isothermal reaction kinetics. The equation can be expressed as lnk = 24.49-243.3x10(3)/RT. Moreover, the values of the critical temperature of thermal explosion, Delta S-not equal, Delta H-not equal, Delta G(not equal), and the enthalpies of formation were obtained as 206.5 degrees C, -145.543 Jmol(-1)K(-1), 237.18 kJmol(-1), 305.84 kJmol(-1), and -2.65 MJkg(-1), respectively.",2015
Energetic Analysis of Drying Biological Materials with High Moisture Content by Using Microwave Energy,"One of the most important parameters in the drying process is the efficiency of energy transfer. Although it is well known that the absorbed component of the referred energy in the dehydration process under microwave conditions is theoretically lower-especially during the falling rate period of drying-by an order of magnitude than that of convective drying, the real efficiency of energy transfer in the microwave field depends on numerous-partly unknown-factors. In this study, the most significant relations between the energy transfer efficiency and the drying parameters were investigated. During the experiments, two power levels were used to study the effects of domain variables in apple, potato, and onion dehydration processes. The results showed that variations in microwave power level played an important role in overall drying kinetics. Based on the recorded data, we determined the typical energy efficiency factors for microwave drying of apple, potato, and onion. The specific energy consumption was calculated to compare the energy efficiency of a single measurement series. It was evident that by applying higher power levels, the energy utilization was more efficient. Furthermore, we theoretically proved and experimentally showed the nonthermal effects of the microwave energy.",2012
Excited electronic state decomposition mechanisms and dynamics of nitramine energetic materials and model systems,"Energetic materials play an important role in aeronautics, the weapon industry, and the propellant industry due to their broad applications as explosives and fuels. RDX (1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), and CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane) are compounds which contain high energy density. Although RDX and HMX have been studied extensively over the past several decades a complete understanding of their decomposition mechanisms and dynamics is unknown. Time of flight mass spectroscopy (TOFMS) UV photodissociation (ns) experiments of gas phase RDX, HMX, and CL-20 generate the NO molecule as the initial decomposition product. Four different vibronic transitions of the initial decomposition product, the NO molecule, are observed: A 2 Σ(υ'=0)←X 2 Π(υ""=0,1,2,3). Simulations of the rovibronic intensities for the A←X transitions demonstrate that NO dissociated from RDX, HMX, and CL-20 is rotationally cold (∼20 K) and vibrationally hot (∼1800 K). Conversely, experiments on the five model systems (nitromethane, dimethylnitramine (DMNA), nitropyrrolidine, nitropiperidine and dinitropiperazine) produce rotationally hot and vibrationally cold spectra. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) experiments are performed to rule out the possible decomposition product OH, generated along with NO, perhaps from the suggested HONO elimination mechanism. The OH radical is not observed in the fluorescence experiments, indicating the HONO decomposition intermediate is not an important pathway for the excited electronic state decomposition of cyclic nitramines. The NO molecule is also employed to measure the dynamics of the excited state decomposition. A 226 nm, 180 fs light pulse is utilized to photodissociate the gas phase systems. Stable ion states of DMNA and nitropyrrolidine are observed while the energetic materials and remaining model systems present the NO molecule as the only observed product. Pump-probe transients of the resonant A←X (0-0) transition of the NO molecule show a constant signal indicating these materials decompose faster than the time duration of the 226 nm laser light. Calculational results together with the experimental results indicate the energetic materials decompose through an internal conversion to very highly excited (∼5 eV of vibrational energy) vibrational states of their ground electronic state, while the model systems follow an excited electronic state decomposition pathway.",2007
Study on the safety and mechanical properties of a new tetrazole-based energetic material,"DTDA-THA (tris(hydrazin-1-ium)5,5 '-(hydrazin-1-ide-1,2-diylbis((1H-tetrazole-5,1-diyl)))bis(tetrazol-2-ide)) is a novel type of poly-nitrogen energetic material characterized by high nitrogen content, high enthalpy of formation, and low sensitivity. To research the application of DTDA-THA in polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) and improve the safety performance of DTDA-THA in composite explosives, this study calculated the binding energies between ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), polyvinyl butyral (PVB), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and DTDA-THA via density functional theory, respectively. Three types of PBXs molding powders were prepared through the direct method. For further investigation, the moisture absorption of molding powders, the forming density, and the compressive strength of the grains under different binders were characterized. The result of the simulation shows higher binding energy between the crystal surface (2 -1 2) and different binders. The comprehensive order of the binding energies between different binders and the crystal surface of DTDA-THA was DTDA-THA@EVA>DTDA-THA@PVB>DTDA-THA@PVAc. The experimental results show that the addition of binder reduced the hygroscopicity of DTDA-THA and improved the sensitivity and mechanical properties of the molding powders. Under the same binder proportion, the formulation prepared by PVAc had a higher molding density, while the formulation prepared by PVB exhibited the best compressive strength.",2024
Evaluating the Effect of Nanosized CoCuFe2O4 for Thermal Decomposition of Nitrotriazolone High Energetic Material,"Wet chemical synthesis was used to produce nanosize Cobalt-Copper-Ferrite (CoCuFe2O4 or CCF), which was then analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The impact of synthesized CCF on the thermal decomposition of the insensitive high energetic material namely 3-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) at the micron (NTO) and nanoscales (nNTO) was investigated using thermal analysis data acquired at 5, 10, and 15 degrees C min(-1) heating rates. Non-isothermal approaches such as Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and iterative methods were utilized to determine the kinetic parameters of the decomposition process. The findings indicate that CCF can affect both the onset and peak temperature of micro as well as nanosize NTO. The activation energy of nNTO containing 5 % by mass CCF (nNTO:CCF) was much lower than that of pure NTO and the log A value proposed a quicker nNTO :CCF decomposition. nNTO:CCF has the potential to replace NTO in energetic formulations comprising NTO",2022
Iodine-Mediated Furoxan Formation Facilitates the Synthesis of High-Density Tricyclic Fused Energetic Materials,"Fused cyclic energetic material, a special category of pi-conjugate structures containing two or more rings, has been acknowledged as a potential energy source of high energy density in recent years. In the present work, a new tricyclic, fused energetic skeleton [1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine-3-oxide was designed and synthesized. Two typical compounds, 4-azido-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine-3-oxide and 4-amino-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]-pyridazine-3-oxide, were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Both energetic compounds exhibit densities of 1.773 and 1.939 g center dot cm-3 for 2 and 3, respectively. The energetic properties were calculated based on the density and the heat of formation. They possess a good detonation performance (Dv: 8664 m center dot s-1 for 2, 8817 m center dot s-1 for 3; P: 30.9 GPa for 2, 32 GPa for 3). Their impact and friction sensitivities were tested to be 7 J and 108 N for 2 and >40 J and 128 N for 3. The two energetic compounds also show satisfactory onset decomposition temperatures (2:183.7 degrees C; 3:195.3 degrees C) owing to fused furoxan frameworks. All these properties indicate that the above-mentioned new molecules may show their prospective application as versatile energetic materials and devices.",2023
Unfolding the chemistry of FOX-7: Unique energetic material and precursor with numerous possibilities,"FOX-7 demonstrates a fascinating explosophoric motif with a unique combination of detonation performance and stability. Unlike classical explosives, such as TNT, TATB, and RDX, FOX-7 exhibits superior energetic performance originating from its high density, oxygen balance, and dinitro groups. Indeed, owing to its unique energetic properties and versatile molecular structure, a variety of neutral compounds and salts have been synthesized during the past two decades and continuing. These materials comprise NH2 and NO2 groups on the C = C bond as an integral structural unit that provides an opportunity for a diverse blend of physical and detonation properties. This critical review summarizes several synthetic strategies used for structural modification of FOX-7 and highlighted their energetic properties. Due to the chemically tailorable framework, synthetic accessibilities, and superior energetic characteristics, FOX-7 is subjected to intense and expansive research and is undoubtedly considered a promising precursor for developing new explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics.",2022
Broad Range FTIR Spectroscopy and Multivariate Statistics for High Energetic Materials Discrimination,"The objective of this work was to measure infrared spectra of high explosive materials (HE) in wide spectral range in order to acquire information for their complete characterization and find out the regions that are the most discriminatory for each material. Four HEs were measured by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in a very broad range (from near-via mid- to far-IR). Obtained spectra were subsequently evaluated using multivariate statistical methods for dimension reduction and results grouping. Clustering was assessed in terms of compactness and stability in order to distinguish which region or regions are most suitable for the identification based on spectral signature. Based on outcomes of visualization method (silhouette plot) used to compare results of implemented chemometric methods (HCA, PAM, and PCA) done on FTIR spectra collected for four high explosive materials (PETN, C-4, RDX, and TNT) within all regions, it seems that the mid-IR region is the most informative for the distinction among analyzed HE materials based on substance spectral signatures. However, it is worth noticing that also the near-IR region can be used for good differentiation.",2020
Numerical simulation of radiated noise during combustion of energetic materials in a closed bomb,"In this study, based on a closed bomb test combined with computational fluid dynamics, a structural finite element method, and an acoustic boundary element method, a fluid-solid acoustic one-way coupling calculation model is established for the combustion process of energetic materials in a closed bomb, and the effectiveness of the model is verified by experiments. It is found that the maximum peak sound pressure increases exponentially with an increase in loading doses or gas pressure. However, a change in the combustion coefficient of the energetic materials has little effect on the noise generated during the combustion process in the closed bomb. When the combustion coefficient is reduced by a multiple of 16, the maximum transient sound pressure is reduced by 1.79 dB, and the sound pressure level in the frequency band is reduced by 1.75 dB. With an increase in shell thickness, the combustion noise of the energetic materials in the closed bomb decreases, and the reduction range of the combustion noise increases with the increase in shell thickness.

A potential insensitive-highly-energetic material through conjugation-promoted N-oxidation strategy,"Striking a well balance between energy, sensitivity and thermostability of high performing organic materials has become a big challenge in the community of energetic materials. In the recent years, simple N-oxidation approach based on nitropyrimidine and nitropyridazine has been disclosed since the year of 1995 when nitropyrazine-N-oxides (such as LLM-105:2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide) was developed, however, the development of facile N-oxidation via fused heterocylic ring is still stagnant, which has strongly limited the appearance of advanced materials. Herein, we present the specific synthesis of novel energetic materials with excellent properties in different aspects based on pyrazolium[5,1-C][1,2,4]triazine framework. Especially, for the first time we synthesized pyrazolium[5,1-C] [1,2,4]triazine N-oxide, which also suggests that N-oxidation has introduced more intramolecular hydrogen bonds and resulted in larger conjugation effect at the molecular level, giving rise to an effective strategy in improving energy, safety and thermostability of energetic materials simultaneously. All compounds exhibit high densities (1.872-1.917 g center dot cm(-3)) and energetic performance (8657-8990 m center dot s(-1)). Among them, 8-nitro-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazolo[5,1-c]00triazine-4,7-diamine (FPT-3) and 4-amino-7,8-dinitro-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4]triazine-2-oxide (FPT-4) hold brilliant onset decomposition temperatures (FPT-3: Td = 335 C-degrees; FPT-4: Td = 273 C-degrees), good detonation properties (FPT-3: V-d = 8657 m s(-1); FPT-4: V-d = 8851 m center dot s(-1)) and very low sensitivities (FPT-3: IS > 60 J, FS > 360 N; FPT-4: IS > 55 J, FS > 360 N), which indicate that both compounds are high energy explosives with very low sensitivity and excellent thermostability.",2022
The role of aluminum particle size in electrostatic ignition sensitivity of composite energetic materials,"Very often unintentional ignition of composite energetic materials (CEM) occurs when static electricity is discharged into the CEM. An interesting finding recently reported showed that for micron particle CEM formulations, only aluminum (Al) combined with copper oxide (CuO) was electrostatic discharge (ESD) ignition sensitive, while commonly used Al combined with molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was deemed not ESD ignition sensitive. In practice however, nano Al-MoO3 results in frequent unintentional ESD ignition events. This study examines the role of Al particle size on ESD ignition sensitivity and measures electrical conductance for each CEM. Results show that as Al particle size is reduced, electrical conductance increases dramatically as does ESD ignition sensitivity. Overall, electrical conductance is shown to increase linearly with increasing Al surface area to volume ratio and the alumina passivation shell surrounding Al core particles plays a significant role in enhancing ignition sensitivity.

Multi-expression programming based model for prediction of formation enthalpies of nitro-energetic materials,"There has been considerable interest in predicting the properties of nitro-energetic materials to improve their performance. Not to mention insightful physical knowledge, computational-aided molecular studies can expedite the synthesis of novel energetic materials through cost reduction labours and risky experimental tests. In this paper, quantitative structureproperty relationship based on multi-expression programming employed to correlate the formation enthalpies of frequently used nitro-energetic materials with their molecular properties. The simple yet accurate obtained model is able to correlate the formation enthalpies of nitro-energetic materials to their molecular structure with the accuracy comparable to experimental precision.",2013
Influence of cathode material on generation of energetic hydrogen atoms in a glow discharge,"In this paper influence of cathode material on formation of fast hydrogen atoms in an abnormal glow discharge is investigated using Balmer alpha emission spectroscopy. Energetic H atoms are generated in charge exchange reactions of hydrogen ions that are accelerated in the electric field, and also formed in the backscattering process at the cathode surface. Copper and graphite cathodes were used. Investigation was performed in two orthogonal directions of observation in pure hydrogen and argon-hydrogen mixture. The shapes of the profiles are examined together with the space intensity distribution of Balmer alpha line. Reduced atom reflection from graphite was manifested in the spectroscopic result, in accordance to the field acceleration model. The effect was evident only at high ion energies. This is explained by energy dependence of reflection coefficient for H atoms. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3530869]",2011
Thermal and chemical behaviour of an energetic material and a heat release rate issue,"Energetic materials encompass a wide range of chemical compounds all associated with a significant risk of fire and explosion. They include explosives, fireworks, pyrotechnics, powders, propellants and other unsteady chemicals. These materials store a high level of chemical energy and are able to release it rapidly without external contribution of oxygen or any other oxidizer. The behaviour of these materials in case of explosive detonations is relatively wellknown from empirical and practical points of view. However, fundamental scientific questions remain unanswered related to the mechanisms of heat release. The current understanding of these mechanisms lacks appropriate thermochemical characterisation. The aim of the study is the analysis of thermal and chemical characteristics of energetic materials under conditions that exclude detonations. Detonation is excluded in order to better isolate the thermal and chemical mechanisms involved in the burning process. The experimental work has been conducted using the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA) [ASTM E2058‐03]. One of the benefits of using this experimental apparatus rather than the Cone Calorimeter is that it allows controlling the feed of heat and oxidizer to the reaction zone. The material chosen to conduct experiments on is a ternary smoke powder based on a mixture of starch and lactose as fuel components and potassium nitrate as oxidizer. This product is currently used by fire brigades to assess smoke venting systems efficiency of buildings. The kinetics associated with the combustion of the material was assessed slow enough to allow measuring instruments to capture the thermal and chemical evolution during combustion reaction. Thermal analysis has first been carried out by means of DSC, TGA, DTA, MS and FTIR data in order to understand the decomposition of the material and its energetic evolution when undergoing heating. However, if the latter methods help defining the decomposing path of the material, they do not provide an integral view of its combustion behaviour, in particular, the emissions of toxics which are kinetic path dependent. Subsequently, combustion tests have been carried out using the FPA. Its ability to capture the evolution of gases emissions formed during the reaction has been proved. The influence of two configuration parameters on the combustion behaviour and on the gaseous emissions of the material has been investigated. The proportion fuel/oxidizer has been varied as well as the composition of the reacting atmosphere. Results shows that the quantity of oxidizer in the material affects the kinetics of the reactions taking place in the condense phase. Increasing the concentration of potassium nitrate in the mixture enhanced the reaction rate of the smouldering combustion. Higher quantity of volatiles is released which favoured the initiation of a diffusion flame regime in the gaseous phase, above the sample. While the kinetics of the condense phase is governed by the oxidizer concentration, experiments show that the flaming regime is influenced by the concentration of oxygen (O2) in the reacting atmosphere. A transition from diffusion to premixed flame is found when the concentration of O2 surrounding the sample is reduced below 18%. An analytical model has been used to explain the existence of a transition for a critical O2 concentration. Finally, thermal and combustion analyses have allowed to characterise the behaviour of the material under critical conditions, in terms of decomposition taking place in the condense phase but also potential toxic emissions that can be released. Toxicity, kinetics, temperature evolution do not provide a complete view of the combustion phenomenon. Beside these elements that characterise the behaviour of a material for given conditions as well as also the degree of fire hazard encountered, the energetic issue holds as an essential feature that cannot be neglected. The heat release rate (HRR) is a critical parameter that defines a fire. It does not constitute an intrinsic material property but it describes the energetic response of the couple formed by the material and its environment. Oxygen Consumption calorimetry (OC) and Carbon Dioxide Generation calorimetry (CDG) are widespread methods to calculate the HRR resulting from a combustion reaction. Apparatuses such as the FPA or the cone calorimeter have already proved their potential to qualify the burning behaviour of common fuels in addition to polymers when their data are combined with an adapted calorimetric procedure. The same approach has been applied to energetic materials. However, prior to using these techniques, it is fundamental to have identified their restrictions. These techniques provide approximate estimations of the HRR. Results are affected by the propagation of uncertainties. Several sources of uncertainties can be found. One can cite: 1. Uncertainties associated with the sample material; 2. Uncertainties associated with the test conditions; 3. Uncertainties associated with the measurements; 4. Uncertainties associated with calculation assumptions. If uncertainties cannot always be estimated, the three first sources cited have received attention in the past from the scientific community, alike the last one. The restrictions associated with the assumptions developed for using the OC and CDG principles have to be clarified. The limits of validity of the hypotheses have to be clearly defined. In particular, the present dissertation questions the relevance of the energy constants that have been specified for OC and CDG as well as their related uncertainties. One of the purposes of the research deals with the ability to estimate accurate error bars for the calculation of the HRR. Once uncertainties related to the calorimetric methods are assessed, a method adapted from the basic OC and CDG principles is introduced that allows estimating the HRR of energetic materials. The approach is based on considering the chemical decomposition of the burning compound and defining a fictitious molecule for which energy coefficients can be calculated. Nevertheless, it requires the material to be known. Finally, the question of the advantage brought by these techniques over others, in terms of accuracy, is discussed within the framework of unconventional products, such as energetic materials or compounds whose composition is ignored. The results from this work will contribute to the development of fireanalysis methodologies and validate their use with energetic materials.",2010
T-Jump/time-of-flight mass spectrometry for time-resolved analysis of energetic materials,"We describe a new T-Jump/time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer for the time-resolved analysis of rapid pyrolysis chemistry of solids and liquids, with a focus on energetic materials. The instrument employs a thin wire substrate which can be coated with the material of interest, and can be rapidly heated (10(5) K/s). The T-jump probe is inserted within the extraction region of a linear TOF mass spectrometer, which enables multiple spectra to be obtained during a single reaction event. By monitoring the electrical characteristics of the heated wire, the temperature could also be obtained and correlated to the mass spectra. As examples, we present time-resolved spectra for the ignition of nitrocellulose and RDX. The fidelity of the instrument is demonstrated in the spectra presented which show the temporal formation and decay of several species in both systems. The simultaneous measurement of temperature enables us to extract the ignition temperature and the characteristic reaction time. The time-resolved mass spectra obtained show that these solid energetic material reactions, under a rapid heating rate, can occur on a time scale of milliseconds or less. While the data sampling rate of 10000 Hz was used in the present experiments, the instrument is capable of a maximum scanning rate of up to similar to 30 kHz. The capability of high-speed time-resolved measurements offers an additional analytical tool for the characterization of the decomposition, ignition, and combustion of energetic materials.

Design and characterization of new advanced energetic biopolymers based on surface functionalized cellulosic materials,"A new class of energetic biopolymers, which contain nitrate ester (O-NO2) and nitramine (N-NO2) as explosophoric groups, was successfully synthesized by surface modification of renewable pristine cellulose (PC) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) via epichlorohydrin-mediated amination followed by nitration process to produce new promising energetic aminated and nitrated cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose (APCN and AMCCN). Their structural, thermal, crystallinity and morphological features were examined and compared to those of the common cellulose nitrate. Furthermore, their energetic performances were evaluated by EXPLO5 V6.04 software. Experimental results confirm the successful chemical functionalization process to develop insensitive APCN and AMCCN with outstanding features such as nitrogen content of 15.01% and 15.39%, density of 1.692 g/cm(3) and 1.708 g/cm(3), and detonation velocity of 7526 m/s and 7752 m/s, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the nitrated unmodified cellulosic biopolymers. The present investigation provides a suitable pathway to design new insensitive and energy-rich dense cellulosic biopolymers for potential application in high-performance solid propellants and composite explosives.",2021
Development of quantitative structure property relationships for predicting the melting point of energetic materials,"The accurate prediction of the melting temperature of organic compounds is a significant problem that has eluded researchers for many years. The most common approach used to develop predictive models entails the derivation of quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs), which are multivariate linear relationships between calculated quantities that are descriptors of molecular or electronic features and a property of interest. In this report the derivation of QSPRs to predict melting temperatures of energetic materials based on descriptors calculated using the AM1 semiempirical quantum mechanical method are described. In total, the melting points and experimental crystal structures of 148 energetic materials were analyzed. Principal components analysis was performed in order to assess the relative importance and roles of the descriptors in our QSPR models. Also described are the results of k means cluster analysis, performed in order to identify natural groupings within our study set of structures. The QSPR models resulting from these analyses gave training set R-2 values of 0.6085 (RMSE=+/- 15.7 degrees C) and 0.7468 (RMSE=+/- 13.2 degrees C). The test sets for these clusters had R-2 values of 0.9428 (RMSE = +/- 7.0 degrees C) and 0.8974 (RMSE = +/- 8.8 degrees C), respectively. These models are among the best melting point QSPRs yet published for energetic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2015
Preparation of anhydrous FeF,"In recent years, metal fluorides are increasingly being investigated as promising oxidants in aluminum-based (Albased) composite energetic materials to improve the ignition and combustion performance, mainly because of their reaction with the otherwise inert alumina shell. However, the hygroscopicity and relatively high cost of many metal fluorides limit their wide applications. In this work, an effective and mild solvothermal method employing inexpensive raw materials is used to synthesize the otherwise costly anhydrous FeF2. A novel Al/FeF2 energetic composite is then prepared using ultrasound-assisted physical mixing and compared with other more common formulations (Al/PTFE, Al/FeF3, Al/Fe2O3, and Al/FeO) in terms of energetic characteristics. Electric ignition and constant-volume combustion tests show that Al/FeF2 has a shorter ignition delay time than that of Al/PTFE, as well as a much faster reaction rate and a much greater pressure output capacity than each of Al/ FeF3, Al/Fe2O3, and Al/FeO. High-speed photography demonstrates the large flame area and short flame duration of Al/FeF2. Moreover, thermal analysis reveals the superior exothermic enthalpy of Al/FeF2.Overall, anhydrous FeF2 prepared in this study shows excellent application potential in Al-based composite energetic materials.",2024
Gram-scale synthesis of graphene quantum dots via energetic material deflagration for bioimaging application,"Graphene quantum dots, which possesses unique photoluminescence property, have received enormous attention for bio-sensor, photovoltaic devices and bioimaging application. However, synthesizing high-quality of GQDs remains a formidable obstacle in terms of the two conventional methods since the ""top-down"" method usually requires expensive raw materials while the ""bottom-up"" method suffers from incompatibility between quality and production. Thus, developing new strategies to trade-off these issues is promising for GQDs production. Here, we reported an ultrafast deflagration strategy by igniting Al and pentafluoropyridine mixture to prepare high -quality of carbon nanomaterials (CNs) with high graphitization, reaching a high yield of-3 g. Combining with a subsequent Hummer's exfoliation and dialyze method, the CNs materials were successfully exfoliated into the uniform-dispersed graphene quantum dots (D-GQDs) with size of 1-2 nm. The as-prepared D-GQDs de-rivatives shows remarkable optical properties and it is successfully applied in fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells. Our results in this study highlighted the high efficiency of deflagration technique to prepare functional carbon -based nanomaterials, and proposed a facile and fast strategy for gram-scale synthesis.",2024
Meso-scale simulation of energetic materials. II. Establishing structure-property linkages using synthetic microstructures,"Meso-scale simulations of pressed energetic materials are performed using synthetic microstructures generated using deep feature representation, a deep convolutional neural network-based approach. Synthetic microstructures are shown to mimic real microstructures in the statistical representation of global and local features of micro-morphology for three different classes of pressed HMX with distinctive micro-structural characteristics. Direct numerical simulations of shock-loaded synthetic microstructures are performed to calculate the meso-scale reaction rates. For all three classes, the synthetic microstructures capture the effect of morphological uncertainties of real microstructures on the response to shock loading. The calculated reaction rates for different classes also compare well with those of the corresponding real microstructures. Thus, the article demonstrates that machine-generated ensembles of synthetic microstructures can be employed to derive structure-property-performance linkages of a wide class of real pressed energetic materials. The ability to manipulate the synthetic microstructures using deep learning-based approaches then provides an opportunity for material designers to develop and manufacture pressed energetic materials that can yield targeted performance.",2022
The effect of nitro groups on N,"ortho nitroaromatic azides extrude N-2 through cyclization to a benzofuroxan derivative. This process has been proposed to initiate explosive decomposition in related energetic materials such as 1-azido-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (AzTNB) and 1,3,5-triazido-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TAzTNB). Density functional theory calculations show that extrusion occurs through a lower activation barrier than in the case of the absence of an ortho nitro group (i.e., azidobenzene, m-nitroazidobenzene, p-nitroazidobenzene) where the product is a triplet nitrene. In ortho nitroaromatic azides, Wiberg bond index (WBI) analysis indicates that the N-N-2 bond is more weakened, or activated for cleavage, than the C-NO2 bond. Therefore, the N-N-2 bond breaking is a key factor in initiation of explosive decomposition in energetic materials containing both nitro and azide groups. However, cyclization requires that the activation barrier also be dependent upon the formation of an N-O bond from an adjacent nitro group. ortho and para nitro substitution can increase N-N-2 bond activation through electron withdrawing, but this effect can be counterbalanced by steric interactions that twist the azide out of the plane of the ring or increase the NMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO distance in the reactant. For example, steric factors decrease the sensitivity of energetic material TAzTNB relative to AzTNB consistent with experimental trends in impact sensitivity.",2019
Novel strategies for synthesizing energetic materials based on BTO with improved performances,"The layer-by-layer assembly of molecules is ubiquitous in nature. Highly ordered structures formed in this manner often exhibit fascinating material properties. A layer hydrogen bonding pairing approach allows the development of tunable energetic materials with targeted properties. A series of unusual energetic compounds based on 1H,1 ' H-5,5 '-bistetrazole-1,1 '-diolate (1), such as the salts of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazolium (2), aminoguanidinium (3), and hydrazinium (4), and the cocrystals of 4-amino-1H-pyrazole (5), 2-methylimidazole (6), and imidazole (7), were synthesized using this strategy. The structures of the obtained products 2-7 were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Their thermal decomposition behavior was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. Their mechanical sensitivities and detonation performances were also analyzed in detail. Results show that products 2-7 exhibit higher density, better detonation performances, and more excellent sensitivities than those of the same species of cation salts previously reported.",2019
Framework-Interpenetrated Nitrogen-Rich Zn(II) Metal-Organic Frameworks for Energetic Materials,"Nitrogen-rich high density metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used as a new type of energetic materials. The energetic MOFs provide a new method to reconcile contradiction between high energy and reliable safety in energetic materials. Framework interpenetration would be an effective approach to reduce the pore volume and meanwhile to enhance the structural/chemical stabilities of the target energetic MOFs. In this work, mixed ligands of 5-aminotetrazole (HATZ) and tetrazole (HTZ) were chosen to assemble with Zn(II) ions with the purpose to prepare interpenetrated MOF materials with insensitivity. Ultimately, a high-density 3D energetic compound, [Zn-2(ATZ)(2)(TZ)(2)](n) (1) was in situ isolated under simple hydrothermal conditions. In the crystal structure of 1, there existed two independent 3D diamond networks, which were formed by Zn1(II) ions/TZ(-) ligands and Zn2(II) ions/ATZ(-) ligands, respectively. These two independent 3D diamond networks were interpenetrated to each other to construct a 3D condensed high-density framework. The standard molar enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f degrees) of 1 was deduced as 1786.45 kJ/mol (4.09 kJ/g), which to date still occupies the status of the top high Delta H-f degrees value among the reported energetic MOF materials. Conducted sensitivity measurements demonstrated the insensitivity of 1 to external mechanical stimuli. TGA showed 1 had good thermal stability up to 332 degrees C, whereas the decomposition temperature of pure HATZ and HTZ ligands are 207 and 174 degrees C, respectively. This shows that the greater stability of 1 could be attributed to the structural reinforcement induced by the effect of coordination polymerization and framework interpenetration. Compound 1 can serve as a promising energetic material with a high level of safety because of its good energetic properties, insensitivity, and high thermal stability.",2019
The impact of crystal morphology on the thermal responses of ultrasonically-excited energetic materials,"The ability to detect explosive materials may be significantly enhanced with local increases in vapor pressure caused by an elevation of the materials' temperature. Recently, ultrasonic excitation has been shown to generate heat within plastic-bonded energetic materials. To investigate the impact of crystal morphology on this heating, samples of elastic binder are implanted with single ammonium perchlorate crystals of two distinct shape groups. Contact piezoelectric transducers are then used to excite the samples at ultrasonic frequencies. The thermal responses of the crystals are recorded using infrared thermography, and the rate of heating is estimated. Surface temperature increases up to 15 degrees C are found to arise after 2 s of excitation, with much higher heating levels expected near the inclusions themselves as demonstrated by the chemical decomposition of some crystals under favorable excitation conditions. The rates of heat generation are compared to various crystal morphology features through 2D estimates of length scale, perimeter and irregularity. It is observed that crystals grown in the lab, featuring sharp geometric facets, exhibit a higher probability of significant heat generation than inclusions with more spherical shapes. However, no statistical link is found between the rates of heat generation and the crystal morphology in those samples that do generate significant heating, likely because variations in surface roughness cannot be entirely eliminated during experimentation. It is hoped that this study will lead to a better understanding of the nature of heat generation in energetic materials from ultrasonic sources. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",2016
DSC measurement and prediction of phase diagrams for binary mixtures of energetic materials' stabilizers,"This study reports the investigation of four binary mixtures of diphenylamine (1)+ N-ethyl-4-nitroaniline (2), ethyl centralite (1) + N-ethyl-4-nitroaniline (2), methyl centralite (1)+ N-ethyl-4-nitroaniline (2) and N-(2-acetoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline (1) + N-ethyl-4-nitroaniline (2). The liquidus and solidus equilibrium temperatures determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were used to construct the corresponding solid liquid phase diagrams. On the basis of the DSC results, simple eutectic behaviours for four systems were observed. The experimental results were correlated by means of Wilson and UNIQUAC equations. The root-mean-square deviations of the solubility temperatures for all measured data vary from 0.80 to 4.05 K and depend on the particular model used. The best solubility correlation was obtained with the UNIQUAC model. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013
Micro/Nano Functional Manufacturing: from Microthruster to Nano Energetic Material to Micro/Nano Initiator,"Functional manufacturing technologies are becoming more and more important to the manufacturing industry and research. As promising categories of functional manufacturing, micro and nano manufacturing have received steadily growing interests in recent years. In this paper, as typical examples to demonstrate micro and nano manufacturing, our work on microthruster, nano energetic material, and micro/nano initiator is presented. Microspacecraft is one application of microsystem in space. In a microspacecraft, a micropropulsion system is required for station keeping, attitude control, and orbit adjust. New silicon and ceramic microthrusters are described. Energetic materials including propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics have found diverse applications. Nano energetic materials (nEMs) have improved performances in energy release, ignition, and mechanical properties compared to their bulk/micro counterparts. A novel nano Al and CuO nanowire based nEM is discussed. Electro-explosive devices (EEDs) activated by electrical energy are used to initiate an explosive, burning, electrical, or mechanical train. EEDs have found numerous applications in triggering the inflation of airbags in automobiles, micropropulsion, and arm fire/safe devices for ordnance systems. An innovative EED is developed by integrating Al/CuO based nEM with a Au/Pt/Cr micro heater on a substrate.",2010
Review of Phase Transformations in Energetic Materials as a Function of Pressure and Temperature,"Under ambient conditions, energetic materials may exist in one or more than one metastable crystal structure. Under compression or when heated, the material may transform into a different structure or may decompose. Mapping the phase diagram of explosive materials at high pressures and temperatures is an important component to evaluate their performance and safety aspects. In particular, a detailed knowledge of polymorphism and the structural and chemical stabilities of the various phases is necessary to understand the reactive behavior of explosive materials in the high-pressure and high-temperature range that is relevant to shock-wave initiation. Phase transformations could be rate-dependent; that is, fast compression or rapid heating could result in different transformation pressures, temperatures, or even structures compared with static compression and slow heating because shock compression could be accompanied by sudden and extreme heating effects. Nevertheless, static methods are expected to give a fair idea of the structure of the materials under different P-T conditions and, from the structure, their performance characteristics. Also, the shock-wave physics and chemistry of explosives are so complex that in shock experiments it has not been possible to identify the intermediate phases of molecules during decomposition. Hence experiments with static high pressure and high temperature are necessary to gain insight into these processes. Additionally, computational modeling and simulations have been extensively used to understand the effects of pressure on explosives. There is considerable literature on these aspects of energetic materials accumulated over the years. We will review the current status of experimental results, primarily using X-ray diffraction, Raman, and infrared spectroscopies, as probes exploring the P-T phase diagram of important secondary explosives ammonium nitrate, TNT, TATB, PETN, RDX, HMX, CL-20, TEX, FOX-7, and TKX-50.",2019
Micro- and Nanoscale Energetic Materials as Effective Heat Energy Sources for Enhanced Gas Generators,"In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of micro- and nanoscale energetic materials in formulations of aluminum microparticles (Al MPs; heat source)/aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs; heat source)/copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs; oxidizer) on the combustion and gas-generating properties of sodium azide microparticles (NaN3 MPs; gas generating agent) for potential applications in gas generators. The burn rate of the NaN3 MP/CuO NP composite powder was only similar to 0.3 m/s. However, the addition of Al MPs and Al NPs to the NaN3 MP/CuO NP matrix caused the rates to reach similar to 1.5 and similar to 5.3 m/s, respectively. In addition, the N-2 gas volume flow rate generated by the ignition of the NaN3 MP/CuO NP composite powder was only similar to 0.6 L/s, which was significantly increased to similar to 1.4 and similar to 3.9 L/s by adding Al MPs and Al NPs, respectively, to the NaN3 MP/CuO NP composite powder. This suggested that the highly reactive Al MPs and NPs, with the assistance of CuO NPs, were effective heat-generating sources enabling the complete thermal decomposition of NaN3 MPs upon ignition. Al NPs were more effective than Al MPs in the gas generators because of the increased reactivity induced by the reduced particle size. Finally, we successfully demonstrated that a homemade airbag with a specific volume of similar to 140 mL could be rapidly and fully inflated by the thermal activation of nanoscale energetic material-added gas-generating agents (i.e., NaN3 MP/Al NP/CuO NP composites) within the standard time of similar to 50 ms for airbag inflation.",2016
High-order numerical simulation and modelling of the interaction of energetic and inert materials,"We present an integrated algorithm on a Eulerian grid, for multimaterial simulations of energetic and inert materials modelled by non-ideal equations of state. We employ high-resolution shock capturing numerical algorithms for each material inside its domain and use an overlap domain method across the interface, maintained by a recently developed, hybrid, level-set algorithm. For applications to condensed explosives we implement a non-ideal, wide-ranging equation of state and reaction rate law. For inert materials, like plastic, metal, water, etc., we implement a (linear in the pressure) Mie-Gruneisen, (U-p - U-s), equation of state. We present a series of verifications of the integrated multimaterial code and show validations against experiment. We show examples of simulations of various experiments associated with real or planned experiments, some of which contain energetic materials (specifically the condensed explosives PBX-9502 and PBX-9501).",2007
Eulerian hydrocode analysis of reactive micromechanics in the shock initiation of heterogeneous energetic material,"Data support the notion of a two stage “ignition and growth” mechanism in the shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) of heterogeneous high explosives (HE). Ignition is achieved at regions of localized heating (“hot-spots”) behind a propagating shock and growth occurs by heat transfer dominated grain burning. It is well known that sensitivity of heterogeneous HE is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the underlying microstructure. Micromechanical hot-spot models are necessary in order to refine the continuum models and improve our understanding of SDT. Bingham-type viscoplasticity has been used most extensively to model the flow stresses in HE. However, rational estimates of the “solid viscosity” do not appear in the literature. Recent shock compaction experiments in the secondary explosive HMX are used here in conjunction with direct simulation methods to arrive at a rational estimate of viscosity. A novel, efficient chemical kinetics solver is implemented into an Eulerian finite element hydrocode. The solver uses a predictor-corrector method to decouple the integration of mass and energy conservation equations. Subcycle integration and subgrid conduction models are implemented to accommodate the resulting stiff differential equations. Ignition by viscoplastic pore collapse in HMX is analyzed using the reactive hydrocode with McGuire-Tarver reduced chemical kinetics. Effects of dimensional constraints, high pressure melt laws, void size and shock loading characteristics are all analyzed. Several new insights are gained which contradict generally accepted ideas regarding this mechanism of ignition. It is shown that attenuation of the “kick pressure” associated with ignition at the shock front is very sensitive to the viscosity of HE. Mesoscale simulations of granular HE compaction simulate the full SDT scenario from first principles for the first time. The qualitative features of these simulations are consistent with available data for similar configurations. In particular, shock trajectories in the x-t plane, shock acceleration histories, steady detonation velocities and particle size effects are all consistent with observations. Particle size effects are also analyzed in a mock composite HE with either a viscoplastic polymer or water as the matrix. Particle size effects are predicted only in the polymer binder. This is consistent with an updated analysis of existing experimental data.",1999
Colorimetric Sensing of Nitroaromatic Energetic Materials Using Surfactant-Stabilized and Dithiocarbamate-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles,"There is an increasing need for sensitive/selective determination of explosive traces in soil and post-blast debris for environmental and criminal investigations. A colorimetric sensor was developed to detect and quantify trinitrotoluene (TNT) and tetryl by the use of surfactant-stabilized and dithiocarbamate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The sensor was manufactured by modifying the nanoparticles with the cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and incorporating diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) in the AuNPs synthesis. DDTC firmly bound to AuNPs may show charge-transfer interactions with the -NO2 groups of the analytes, and a color change proportional to analyte concentration accompanied the agglomeration of nanoparticles, at which the absorbances were recorded at 534 nm and 458 nm for TNT and tetryl, respectively. Although the limit of detection was 8 mgL(-1) (3.52 x 10(-5) molL(-1)) for TNT and 0.8 mgL(-1) (2.78 x 10(-6) molL(-1)) for tetryl, providing moderate sensitivity, the cost was greatly reduced compared to those of other thiol-functionalized AuNPs sensors. Possible interferences of other energetic substances in synthetic mixtures, of camouflage materials used in passenger belongings (e.g., detergent, sugar, caffeine, and paracetamol) and common soil ions were also examined. The method was statistically validated against a reference gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. This sensor may pave the way for the manufacture of novel low-cost nitroaromatic explosive sensors made of DDTC-based pesticides.",2019
Nitrogen-Rich Azoles as High Density Energy Materials: Reviewing the Energetic Footprints of Heterocycles,"In this contribution, recent developments of azole-based high energy density materials are reviewed. A variety of azoles, e.g., pyrazole, imidazole, triazole, and tetrazole, were used as nitrogen-rich backbones and were functionalized with explosophores. The synthetic methods, experimental properties, and theoretical calculations are discussed leading to panoramas of these promising energetic materials.",2017
"The High-Pressure Characterization of Energetic Materials: 1,4-Dimethyl-5-Aminotetrazolium 5-Nitrotetrazolate","In-situ high-pressure room temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction and infrared microspectroscopy were used to examine the structural and vibrational properties and the equation of state of 1,4-dimethyl-5-aminotetrazolium 5-nitrotetrazolate (DMATNT). The X-ray measurements show a smoothly varying pressure-volume relationship to 20 GPa. However, the anisotropic ratios of the unit cell parameters reveal a discontinuity near 3.3 GPa, which can be attributed to an irreversible isostructural phase transition. A significant increase in the Infrared spectral intensity near this pressure coupled with Dayvdov splitting of the NO(2) bending and scissoring modes suggest the transition results in a skewing of the NO(2) groups and increasing asymmetry of the hydrogen bonding sublattice.",2011
"RANDOM PACKS AND THEIR USE IN GRAIN-SCALE MODELING, WITH APPLICATIONS TO ENERGETIC MATERIALS","In recent years, we have constructed closely packed spheres using the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm to generate models of heterogeneous solid propellants. Improvements to the algorithm now allow us to pack nonspherical shapes for modeling heterogeneity in complex energetic materials such as plastic-bonded explosives and pressed gun propellants. In this paper, we review the packing algorithm and present selected results, including higher-order statistics, along with preliminary results of convective burning through a porous medium.",2010
Development of quantitative structure-property relationships for predictive modeling and design of energetic materials,"A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) based on the AM1 semiempirical quantum mechanical method was derived using the program, CODESSA, to describe published drop height impact sensitivities for 227 nitroorganic compounds. An eight-descriptor correlation equation having R-2 = 0.8141 was obtained through a robust least median squares regression. The resulting model is the most comprehensive and systematic quantum mechanically derived QSPR for energetic materials of those that have been published. The predictive capability of the model is also presented and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2008
Testing and evaluation of the thermal damage caused by an explosion of energetic materials,"With the rapid development of the new generation of energetic materials, the testing and evaluation of the damage caused by these materials in an explosion has received much attention worldwide. To assess the thermal damage caused by an explosion of the energetic materials quantitatively, a system to measure the thermal effects is constructed with self-developed heat flux sensors. An evaluation model based on nonlinear regression is proposed. Static explosion tests of both bare TNT grains and typical thermobaric explosives are carried out under the same test conditions. The heat flux is acquired at different distances from the explosion by the contact heat flow density sensors based on the infrared principle. The thermal doses are obtained by integrating the heat flux. Based on the similarity principle for explosions, two basic evaluation models are established for TNT. The TNT equivalent of equal effect, which is utilized to assess the thermal damage of a typical thermobaric explosive, is calculated by substituting the thermal dose and the distance from the explosion center into the basic evaluation model, established for TNT. In our experiments, the maximum errors of the two TNT basic evaluation models are 14.12% and 12.18%, respectively, which can meet the accuracy requirements of an engineering test assessment of the thermal damage caused by an explosion of energetic materials for proportional distances within the range from 1.1672 to 2.280 m according to the test data.",2023
Theoretical Study of the Local Vibrational Modes at Shock Wave Front for Energetic Material,"We evaluate the shock wave profile of beta-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (beta-HMX) by steady flow theory and calculate the force constants by density functional theory. Based on these results, a method to calculate the local phonon states at shock front is developed. We find that the phonon density of states (PDOS) of shock front is non-intersect with the PDOS of crystal, and obtain four important vibrational modes for shock wave: N-NO(2)stretch, NO wagging, CH(2)wagging, and N-NC(2)stretch. According to the vibrational modes, the initial decomposition reactions of beta-HMX at shocked state are denitrification, hydrogen transfer, and ring-opening reactions.",2020
Computational investigation of the properties of double furazan-based and furoxan-based energetic materials,"As a kind of promising energetic materials, the double furazan-based and furoxan-based compounds have raised concerns of many researchers in recent years. In this paper, the optimized structures, energetic properties, heat of formation (HOF), detonation properties, and bond dissociation energies of these compounds were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that the N-O bond, which is close to the adjacent coordinated oxygen atom in furoxan ring, is more fragile than the other N-O bonds in the ring. The double furazan-based derivatives are more stable than the double furoxan-based derivatives. All the titled compounds are divided into five groups because of the different substitute groups on both ends. The HOFs of the substances offer the order of 4 group (the both ends are 1,2,3,4-tetrazine) approximate to 5 group (1,2,4,5-tetrazine) > 3 group (tetrazole) approximate to 1 group (1,2,3-triazole) > 2 group (1,2,4-triazole). All the title compounds also can be divided into three types with the different linkages, -N= N-, -N= N(O)-, and -NH-NH-. The results show that the HOFs of the compounds with different linkages obey the order -N= N-type > -N= N(O)-type> -NH-NH-type. For all titled compounds, bis(4-(1,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)diazene (E5) has the best gas-phase and sol id-phase HOFs. The heat of detonation(Q) of bis(3-(1,2,3,4-tetrazin-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxidiazole-2 -oxide) diazene-1,2-diyl (B4) is the best of all titled compounds. The density of bis((3-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxidiazole -2oxide) oxidodiazene-1,2-diyl (A3) is the best and the second best is bis((4-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxidiazol-3-yl) diazene (E3). The detonation velocities and detonation pressure of A3 and E3 are better than other titled compounds. 1,2-bis((4-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5 -oxidiazol-3-yl) diazene-1-oxide (D3) and 1,2-bis((4-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,5-oxidiazol-3-yl) hydrazine (F3) have superior D and P with low sensitivity. The tetrazole ring plays a vital role in improving detonation velocities and pressure. The results can provide some foundational information for designing new high-density energetic materials.",2016
Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) as a tool for an energetic characterisation of porous materials,"The surface properties of controlled pore glass, silica gel and ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 having different functional groups (hydroxyl, trimethylsilyl and aminopropyl) were investigated by inverse gas chromatography. The porous silicates were used as model system to study correlations between surface chemistry and surface energy by means of the IGC technique. The van Deemter equation was used for the determination of optimum carrier gas flow rate. The dispersive part of surface energy, the specific free energy of adsorption, acceptor donor properties and heat of adsorption were determined from IGC experiments for an energetic characterisation of the porous materials. It is shown that different surface functional groups have an influence onto dispersive interactions with n-alkanes as well as onto the specific interactions with polar molecules.

Theoretical studies on oxadiazole-based layer stacking nitrogen-rich high-performance insensitive energetic materials,"A series of energetic compounds derived from substituted oxadiazole molecules which were theoretically proved to have pi-pi stacking crystal structure using NIC method and QTAIM theory were designed and investigated theoretically as novel high-performance insensitive energetic materials. The heats of formation (HOFs) and detonation parameters were predicted based on Kamlet-Jacobs equations and Born-Haber cycle. All energetic compounds and derivatives were calculated at DFT-B3PW91/6-31G++(d,p) level and exhibited ideal oxygen balance (OB%) (-19.50 similar to 15.68), positive heats of formation (424.0 similar to 957.4 kJ/mol), and pleasant crystal density (1.707 similar to 1.901 g/cm(3)). The predicted results revealed that detonation performances of some designed molecules are equal to traditional energetic materials while they are more stable and insensitive that can be considered to have potential synthesis and application value.",2020
Pore collapse in an energetic material from the micro-scale to the macro-scale,"We examine a pore in an energetic material whose collapse following the passage of a strong genesis shock wave, the subsequent ignition of reactive gases within it produced by pyrolysis at the pore boundary, and the emission of shock waves as a consequence of this ignition, can lead to a detonation. The interest in such a problem arises from the interest in knowing the sensitivity and therefore the safe-handling protocol of energetic materials. We follow the initial pore collapse, before melting occurs, using rational analytical strategies, but to describe the later stages, with full coupling between the physics in the condensate and those in the pore cavity, we describe a numerical strategy. The results provide a description of the power deposition into the energetic material and lead to a power deposition model for the macro-scale, one that encompasses a number of pores. For suitable parameter choices, shock waves generated by the pores interact to form a detonation upstream of the genesis shock.",2015
Experimental analysis of rheological behaviour of a multi-base energetic material during conventional extrusion,"The final quality to be achieved during conventional extrusion of energetic materials depends on diverse factors such as the material formulation, extrusion parameters, characteristics of raw materials and previous stages like mixing process. Process optimization is really complex due to the existence of a great number of factors, and the nature of the distinct phenomena involved. In the present work, the extrusion of a multi-base energetic material is studied, with the purpose of discovering the relation between the main factors of this process and the optimum conditions for this forming stage. The effect of rheological properties of initial compounds, extrusion velocity, extrusion pressure and chemical formulation are evaluated, considering two alternative formulations for a triple-base propellant. The analysis of rheological properties served to deduce the recommended parameters for conventional extrusion of these triple-base propellant, as well as essential information about the process variability and expected quality of final products.

Temperature response and chemical reactions of energetic materials under thermal radiation and heat conduction,"Thermal radiation from a high-temperature source is the primary cause of energetic material explosions. However, current research cannot meet the need to prevent thermal radiation-caused explosions. This paper proposes a novel numerical calculation model for temperature response and the chemical reaction of energetic materials under thermal radiation based on the physical mechanisms and evolution of the thermal effect during the chain explosion accident. This model is essential for rapidly evaluating the effect of thermal radiation in chain explosion accidents. The numerical model in this study efficiently obtained the thermal response of energetic materials under thermal radiation, as well as the critical conditions for energetic material explosion under thermal radiation. The results reveal that heat conduction is difficult to cause the explosion of ammonium nitrate, but thermal radiation can. The critical temperature of explosion for ammonium nitrate is 1668 K, the critical duration is 15.93 s, and the critical distance is 7.85 m. The temperature, duration, and radiation distance of the heat source are crucial factors that induce the ammonium nitrate explosion. Firefighters must cover and protect ammonium nitrate within 7200 s and 15.93 s, respectively, when the external heat flow absorbed by the material is 2.688 kW/m2 and 28 kW/m2. The model proposed in this paper can predict the effect of thermal radiation once the heat source parameters are known. Besides, combined with machine learning, the model can also predict the heat source parameters once the parameters of the thermal radiation effect are known. Compared with the current numerical models to evaluate the effect of thermal radiation, the numerical model presented in this paper can evaluate the effect of thermal radiation in engineering more efficiently and has broad application prospects.",2024
Thermal Decomposition Mechanism of Molecular Perovskite Energetic Material (C,"The recently developed ammonium perchlorate-based molecular perovskite has been demonstrated to exhibit excellent comprehensive performance as an energetic material. This ABX(3)-type molecular perovskite energetic material consists of a high symmetry ternary structure framework stabilized through ionic bonds. In this work, the thermal decomposition mechanism of (C6NH14)(NH4)(ClO4)(3) (DAP-4) was extrapolated by analyzing its thermal decomposition characteristics, gas products, kinetic parameters, and condensed phase change results along with temperature-varying, with the help of DSC-TG-MS-FTIR and in-situ FTIR experiment. The results show that a rapid reaction occurs once the decomposition of DAP-4 starts at 383.7 degrees C, with the maximum thermal weight loss rate reaches 97.4 %. By using Kissinger's and Ozawa's method, the calculated activation energy of thermal decomposition of DAP-4 was estimated to be 124.3 kJ/mol and 128.6 kJ/mol, respectively, demonstrating good reliability of our results. The gas products during the thermal decomposition were found mainly include NH3, H2O, HNCO, HCN, CO, HCl, and CO2. The decomposition process of DAP-4 contains three stages. The first stage involves crystal form changes and H+ transfer of DPA-4, followed by the collapse of the cage skeleton in the second stage. The third stage mainly involves a rapid redox reaction at high temperatures to generate great heat.",2022
Selectively-deposited energetic materials: A feasibility study of the piezoelectric inkjet printing of nanothermites,"This work investigated the utility of three piezoelectric inkjet printers as energetic material deposition systems, focusing on the ability of each system to achieve the seamless integration of energetic material into small-scale electronic devices. Aluminum copper (II) oxide nanothermite was deposited using the three deposition systems. The printers were evaluated based on their robustness to energetic ink solids loading, drop formation reliability, drop quality degradation over time, and the energetic performance of the deposited material. These metrics correlate to the feasibility of a deposition system to successfully achieve high sample throughput while maintaining the energetic performance of the printed material. After initial system testing, the PipeJet P9 500 mu m pipe was used to demonstrate the successful deposition of nanothermite in varying geometric patterns with micrometer precision. From these samples, preliminary propagation speed measurements were obtained, which showed a correlation between the printed line widths and burning rates.",2018
"4,4,8,8-Tetranitroadamantane-2,6-diyl Dinitrate: A High-Density Energetic Material","The novel high-performance energetic material 4,4,8,8-tetra-nitroadamantane-2,6-diyl dinitrate has been synthesized and fully characterized. The synthetic strategy features the construction of the adamantane skeleton with different functional groups at adjacent methylene carbon atoms to overcome the problems associated with the ortho effect and steric crowding, and is amenable to the synthesis of other polynitroadamantanes.

Polynitrobenzenes Containing Alkoxy and Alkylenedioxy groups: Potential HEMs and Precursors of New Energetic Materials,"Several di-, tri- and tetranitroderivatives of alkoxy-, dialkoxy-, trialkoxy- and cyclic alkylenedioxybenzene derivatives were synthesized by nitration of starting compounds under different conditions and their properties were compared to the already known 2,4,6-trinitroanisole and TNT. Synthesized trinitro- and tetranitrocompounds of alkoxy-/alkylenedioxybenzene (especially cyclic derivatives) may serve as useful precursors for the synthesis of numerous energetic derivatives.

Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol-Yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials,"Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting-edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well-established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol-yne coupling, a versatile metal-free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy-rich, size-matched, and reductive 1,2-dicarbadodecaborane-1-thiol (CB-SH) into an acetylene-functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2, via thiol-yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6 % increase in energy density, a six-fold reduction in ignition delay time (4 ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB-SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol-yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials. Through thiol-yne click chemistry, the energy-rich and reductive carborane subunits were covalently incorporated into the pores of energetic frameworks. This innovative decoration approach enables integrate multiple functionalities, ultimately achieving enhanced energy density, improved safety and shortened ignition delay time of the energetic frameworks. image",2024
Highly Energetic Materials-Hosted 3D Inverse Opal-like Porous Carbon: Stabilization/Desensitization of Explosives,"The precise control of sensitivity to external stimuli, for example, impact, friction, and thermal energy, has been emphasized for highly energetic materials, including RDX and HMX. Such sensitivities could be controlled by adjusting the surface area or (in)organic additives; however, increased stability leads to a decrease in the explosives' performance. Here, high-energy-density molecules hosted in inverse opal-like porous carbon (IOC) nanocomposites demonstrate the mechanical stabilization and desensitization of RDX and HMX inside the carbon nanostructure using host-guest chemistry techniques. For this strategy, the uniform, vacant voids of the IOC were used to provide internal crystallization for the impact/frictional stabilization of explosives, and also to enhance the thermal reactivity by the high heat conductivity of IOC initiating detonation by thermally induced hotspot. The weight percentage of high explosives hosted by recrystallization at high temperatures and in vacuum reached similar to 70%. After high explosives were embedded inside the IOC, the impact, friction and electrostatic stability was greatly increased (2-2.15-fold, 1.86-1.92-fold, and 1.25-2-fold, respectively) compared with free RDX and HMX. Also, addition of PVP as a binder controlled the effectiveness and efficiency of the carbon template, enabling control of the impact and friction sensitivity from 14.72 J to >79.43 J and from 295.81 to 352.80 N, respectively.",2018
The thermomechanical response of composite energetic materials under high- and low-frequency mechanical excitations,"The preferential generation of heat within hidden explosive materials would be highly valuable to currently-existing explosives detection technologies, due to the associated increase in vapor pressure and thus concentration of detectable vapors. In this work, the thermomechanics of plastic-bonded explosives, propellants, and surrogates thereof are investigated due to their widespread adoption in improvised explosive devices. These classes of material consist of energetic crystals held within an inert plastic binding material. Understanding the composite nature of the material, two methods of heat generation are investigated: low-frequency excitation with wavelengths on the structural-scale and ultrasonic excitation with wavelengths on the crystal-scale. It is observed that direct, electrodynamic shaker-produced excitation at structural resonances of the bulk explosive structure leads to viscoelastic-like heating, with results in good agreement with classical viscoelastic theory in both beam and plate geometries. In this case, scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography were employed to capture the mechanical and thermal response of the structures, respectively. Typically, this type of heating was seen to induce a 2 degrees C surface temperature rise over 60 min with 2 g of base excitation. Further related work included the development of an experimental methodology to determine the wavespeeds of common binder materials. Excitation at ultrasonic frequencies was investigated first in fully-loaded energetic composites, revealing the possibility of heat generation in response to direct ultrasonic stimulus. In this frequency regime incident energy is expected to interact not with the bulk structure but with the individual crystals of the plastic-bonded explosive. Further studies involved the creation of unique single-crystal samples excited with piezoelectric ultrasonic patch transducers. This method elicited very strong heating after just 2 s, up to approximately 10 degrees C and larger. In certain cases, chemical decomposition of energetic crystals has occurred as a result of this heating. To compare between samples, a 1-dimensional semi-infinite thermal model was fit to the transient surface temperature profiles to estimate the heat generation strength and source depth. Crystalline inclusions were observed to generate significantly more heat than spherical inclusions, with no significant dependency on energetic content. Further studies suggest that more irregular crystals exhibit a greater probability of exhibiting significant heating. Finally, initial work on high solids loading 'particles-of-particles' is discussed, highlighting a possible link between solids loading and susceptibility to chemical decomposition in response to ultrasonic stimuli.",2016
Structural and vibrational properties of nitrogen-rich energetic material guanidinium 2-methyl-5-nitraminotetrazolate,"We present density functional theory calculations on the crystal structure, equation of state, vibrational properties and electronic structure of nitrogen-rich solid energetic material guanidinium 2-methyl-5-nitraminotetrazolate (G-MNAT). The ground state structural properties calculated with dispersion corrected density functionals are in good agreement with experiment. The computed equilibrium crystal structure is further used to calculate the equation of state and zone-center vibrational frequencies of the material. The electronic band structure is calculated and found that the material is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a value of 3.04 eV. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2014
Effects of energetic irradiation on materials and devices based on graphene and topological insulators,"This report focuses on the optical and electronic properties of graphene and topological insulators and how these Dirac fermion systems interact with energetic irradiation. We first present data exploring the effects of electron-beam and oxygen plasma induced disorder on the electronic properties and Raman spectra of graphene. These initial investigations were important for relating Raman peak intensities and weak localization features to each other and to an average disorder length in graphene, L D . We then integrate gate-effect measurements into the Raman spectroscopy study to fully explore the relationships between carrier density, disorder and Raman spectrum signatures. We find significant a dependence in the Raman spectra on both disorder and carrier density and extract an electron-phonon coupling strength as a function of disorder, which could prove valuable for understanding electron-phonon physics in doped and disordered graphene. We conclude the report with smaller chapters covering other investigations undertaken during the period of study encompassed by this dissertation. This includes our work investigating the use of graphene to modulate the intensity of perpendicular laser light through changes in carrier density, as well as our work using graphene field-effect devices as radiation sensors. We also investigate the etching rates and Raman spectra of various topological insulators.",2014
Energetic and entropic selectivities in air separation with microporous materials: Molecular theory and simulations,"Diffusivity-based separation of gas mixtures with microporous media is a topic of great technological and scientific importance. The separation of air in this mode is particularly challenging since oxygen and nitrogen molecules have very similar shapes and sizes. An important factor in the design of superior separation media is a knowledge of the molecular-level phenomena responsible for the sieving. In particular, the importance of understanding the relative roles of energetic and entropic (confinement) effects in soft (polymeric) and hard (inorganic) materials has been pointed out [Singh and Koros, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 35 , 1231 (1996)]. This issue is difficult to resolve experimentally, as evidenced by the wide range in reported literature values reviewed here. We take a complementary approach based on molecular modeling, statistical mechanics, and transition-state theory. First we study the separation of oxygen and nitrogen in model windows. Based on a fundamental derivation of expressions for separation selectivity, we calculate the energetic and entropic selectivities for a range of window sizes. Atomic-level flexibility (vibration) is also considered. The entropic selectivities are significantly lower than previously reported theoretical results, but are still consistent with experimental data. The energetic selectivity is seen to be very sensitive to the window dimensions and flexibility, but the entropic contribution is much less affected. After gaining insight into this separation in simple models, we study the entropic and energetic selectivities in glassy polymers using transition-state theory. The selectivity behavior in rigid and flexible matrices is contrasted. Again, the entropic selectivities are not significantly affected by flexibility. Our findings indicate that the lower entropic selectivities offered by soft (polymeric) materials may be the result of geometric factors, rather than lack of rigidity per se . We also use molecular dynamics to gain an understanding of gas separation in membranes comprised of a mixture of inorganic and polymeric materials. The permeation of small molecules (helium and neon) in simple membrane models made of long hydrocarbon chains in bulk and under confinement is studied. The effects of polymer loading and the state of the polymer (rubbery/glassy) on the membrane performance are investigated.",1999
"Preparation, quasi-static, and dynamic compressive mechanical properties of BMG-W energetic structural materials","In this paper, the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 amorphous alloy powder and the spherical W particles were used to prepare the BMG-xW (BMG=Bulk Metallic Glass, x = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 vol%) energetic structural materials (ESMs) by spark plasma sintering. The research results on energy performance indicated that the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 alloy powder had excellent thermal reactivity, high combustion enthalpy and combustion integrity. The microstructure, quasi-static, and dynamic compressive mechanical properties of the BMGxW ESMs were investigated. The quasi-static compression test showed that when the sintering temperature was 365 & DEG;C and above, the BMG-xW ESMs with the W content of 20 vol% to 50 vol% had similar fracture strengths and higher plastic deformation abilities than the BMG samples prepared under the same conditions. We have analyzed the plasticity enhancement mechanism of the BMG-xW ESMs. In addition, the failure modes of the BMG-xW ESMs were all shear fracture, which was conducive to exerting their shear selfsharpening. The Hopkinson compression bar test showed that the fracture strength and failure strain of the BMG-xW ESMs were greater than the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 BMG under dynamic compression at the same strain rate, and the higher the W content, the fracture strength and failure strain tended to increase. All samples showed obvious flame during dynamic compression. The larger the strain rate, the lower the W content, the shorter the ignition delay time, the faster the flame spreading speed and the longer the combustion time. The damage experiment confirmed that the BMG-xW ESMs had significantly superior damage performance than the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 BMG. & COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Halogen bonding (C-F•••X) and its effect on creating ideal insensitive energetic materials,"A series of 3-trifluoromethyl-6-amine-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazine-based energetic materials were ef-ficiency synthesized and fully characterized with IR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses. All new com-pound structures were also confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Among them, compound 8 exhibits an excellent density of 1.90 g cm(-3) which exceeds that of all currently reported trifluoromethyl-containing fused ring en-ergetic materials. Additionally, it has good thermal stability (T-d = 232 degrees C), excellent sensitivities (IS: > 60 J, FS > 360 N) and good detonation performance (Dv = 7877 m s(-1), P = 26.8 GPa) which exceed the corresponding values of all reported trifluoromethyl-containing neutral energetic materials. Further, a detailed study based on X-ray diffraction, electrostatic potential, and intermolecular weak interactions in representative compounds and known compound III demonstrates that halogen bonding C-F center dot center dot center dot X plays an important role in creating good crystal stacking and reducing localized heating from external stimuli, which lead to insensitive energetic materials. This design method for next-generation energetic materials by incorporating intermolecular halogen bonding could be of future importance.",2022
Synthesis of nitrogen-rich and thermostable energetic materials based on hetarenecarboxylic acids,"Two series of both nitrogen-rich and thermostable energetic materials as well as their energetic salts based on hetarenecarboxylic acids are now described. Among these new compounds, neutral compounds 3 and 10 have higher nitrogen contents (69.66% and 63.05%) than their energetic salts, which suggests that they could be used as green energetic materials. In addition, compound 3 shows a good decomposition temperature (T-d = 281 degrees C), which is close to that of TNT (T-d = 295 degrees C). Nitrogen-rich salt 6 exhibits better integrated energetic-properties (D = 8913 m s(-1), IS = 24 J, FS = 320 N) than RDX (D = 8795 m s(-1), IS = 7.5 J, FS = 120 N).",2021
Multi-dimensional mesoscale simulations of detonation initiation in energetic materials with density-based kinetics,"In this work we present multi-dimensional mesoscale simulations of detonation initiation in energetic materials. We solve the reactive Euler equations, with the energy equation augmented by a power deposition term. The reaction rate at the mesoscale is modelled using density-based kinetics, while the deposition term is based on simulations of void collapse at the microscale, modelled at the mesoscale as hot spots. We carry out two- and three-dimensional mesoscale simulations of random packs of HMX crystals in a binder, and show that transition between no-detonation and detonation depends on the number density of the hot spots, the packing fraction, and the post-shock pressure of an imposed shock. In particular, we show that, for a fixed post-shock pressure, there exists a critical value of the number density of hot spots, such that when the number density is below this value a detonation wave will not develop. We highlight the importance of morphology to initiation by comparing with a homogeneous counterpart, and we compare relevant length scales by examining their corresponding power spectra. We also examine the effect of packing fraction and show that at low post-shock pressures there is significant variation in the initiation times, but that this variation disappears as the post-shock pressure is increased. Finally, we compare three-dimensional simulations with the experimental data, and show that the model is capable of qualitatively reproducing the trends shown in the data.",2018
"Nitramino- and Dinitromethyl-Substituted 1,2,4-Triazole Derivatives as High-Performance Energetic Materials","Since highly nitrated nitrogen-rich heterocycles are important motifs in high energy density materials, extensive studies for the development of such novel molecules have been underway. A highly energetic moiety, 3-dinitromethyl-5-nitramino-1,2,4-triazole, which consists of a triazole ring, and nitramino and dinitromethyl groups, has been de-signed and synthesized. By pairing with nitrogen-rich cations, several ionic derivatives were obtained. Theoretical and experimental studies show that the hydroxylammonium salt (7) is highly dense, and has excellent detonation performance with acceptable thermal stablity and sensitivities, which are superior to those of RDX.",2017
"Advanced Open-Chain Nitramines as Energetic Materials: Heterocyclic-Substituted 1,3-Dichloro-2-nitrazapropane","There are great demands to develop explosives with higher performance accompanied by reduced sensitivities towards external stimuli, higher thermal stability and improved environmental acceptability. This contribution presents modified nitramines, which were investigated by nucleophilic substitution reactions of potassium salts of 5-amino-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-dinitroimidazole, 2,4-dinitroimidazole, 4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazole, 3,5-dinitropyrazole, 3,4-dinitropyrazole and 3,4,5-trinitropyrazole on 1,3-dichloro-2-nitrazapropane. The energetic compounds were comprehensively characterized and their detonation parameters were calculated by the EXPLO5 code. Heats of formation were calculated by the atomization method using CBS-4M electronic enthalpies. The presented compounds show detonation performances comparable to pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). In addition, they possess high thermal stabilities and low sensitivities, which make them interesting for further investigations and possible applications as insensitive, high-energy dense materials.",2013
"Review on the Synthesis and Performance for 1,3,4-Oxadiazole-Based Energetic Materials","Energetic materials have been widely used in both military and civilian fields. The development of new high-energy materials with improved performance and enhanced stability is critical for promoting future military and space applications. Recently, researchers in the field of energetic materials have paid significant attention to oxadiazole-based energetic compounds, among which 1,3,4-oxadiazole demonstrates moderate energy levels and better stability, owing to the absence of readily cleaved N-O bonds compared with other oxadiazole isomers, such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 1,2,5-oxadiazole. Therefore, 1,3,4-oxadiazole is an exceptional explosophoric motif with an efficient compromise between energy and stability, and several outstanding energetic materials have been achieved based on the combination of 1,3,4-oxadiazole units with various functional groups or rings, such as polynitrobenzene, furazan, pyrazole, and 1,3,4-oxadiazole itself. This review provides an overview of the development of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based energetic materials during the past few years, outlines their synthesis and energetic performance, and contrasts them with other conventional energetic materials. Owing to the convenience of the synthetic routes and their excellent energetic properties, energetic materials based on the 1,3,4-oxadiazole skeleton may be considered as the next-generation of high-performance energetic materials specifically as heat-resistant explosives or insensitive explosives.",2021
π-π Stacking Contributing to the Low or Reduced Impact Sensitivity of Energetic Materials,"pi-pi stacking, usually together with the aid of hydrogen bonding (HB), serves as a main characteristic of low impact, sensitive, highly energetic materials (LSHEMs), which are highly desired for application, and attracts considerable attention in designing and synthesizing new EMs. This Perspective highlights the progress of the insights into the pi-pi it stacking of EMs, covering traditional energetic crystals with homogeneous neutral molecules, energetic cocrystals (ECCs), and energetic ionic salts (EISs). A rather large pi-bond is a requisite for the pi-pi stacking, and the pi-pi stacking can be classified into four patterns, including face-to-face stacking, wavelike stacking, crossing stacking, and mixing stacking, with an increasing difficulty in shear sliding, and HB plays an important role in supporting sliding layers. Straightforwardly, the stacking pattern-impact sensitivity relationship is rooted in the steric hindrance when sliding, and the face-to-face pi-pi stacking is preferred to design LSHEMs at the crystal level, due to the least steric hindrance or the lowest sliding barrier among the four patterns. This stacking has been extensively observed in traditional EMs, ECCs, and EISs, enlightening us to make a rule for designing new EMs with such stacking. However, it is still difficult to make the rule, attributed to the unclear relationship between molecular and stacking structures. Maybe, it will become increasingly feasible to achieve the rule by establishing a database with detailed information on molecules and related stacking patterns, increasing the amount of data by collecting experimental and predicted results, and combining with advanced machine learning technologies. Combining this article with a recent review of HB in EMs (Cryst. Growth Des. 2019, 19 (10), 5981-5997), an overall perspective of intermolecular interactions in energetic crystals with C, H, O, and N atoms could have been presented.",2020
Al&Fe,"In the present study, the synthesis of electromagnetic absorber hybrid organic-inorganic mesoporous Al&Fe2O3@NO2-Ph-PMO nanocomposite as a new class of nanoenergetic materials with large density of NO2 groups is investigated. For this purpose, the Al&Fe2O3@NO2-Ph-PMO nanocomposite is prepared in five steps: (1) preparation of hybrid organic-inorganic mesoporous Ph-PMO via sol-gel method, (2) incorporation of NO2 moieties on the surface of Ph-PMO by nitration reaction, (3) preparation of iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs) via a chemical precipitation method and thermotransfer to hematite (Fe2O3-MNPs), (4) development of the nanocomposite embedded Fe2O3-MNPs on the surface of hybrid organic-inorganic NO2-Ph-PMO mesoporous structure by ultrasonic method and finally, (5) the preparation and incorporation of Al nanoparticles (as a fuel in thermite reaction) on the surface of Fe2O3@NO2-Ph-PMO using the ultrasound-assisted method which leads to a high energetic nanocomposite propellant, Al&Fe2O3@NO2-Ph-PMO, based superthermite concept. All, the higher loading of the NO2 group on the vast specific surface area of PMO, the electromagnetic absorption property and superthermite character of the nanocomposite are improved and reported in this paper. Finally, the texture and structure of the prepared energetic metastable intermolecular nanocomposite are characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TEM, VSM and N-2 sorption analysis.",2018
"Thermal kinetic analysis, theoretical thermodynamic calculations and antimicrobial activity of three new energetic materials","Three new energetic agents were synthesized using 3,5-dinitro-4-chlorobenzonitrile, sodium azide and hydrazine, which were 2,6-dinitro-4-cyano-azidobenzene (I), N-2,6-dinitro-cyanophenyl-hydrazine (II) and bis-N,N'(2,6-dinitro-4-cyanophenyl)hydrazine (III). These energetic substances were first characterized by elemental analysis, IR, mass, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopic methods. The energetic substances were studied by thermogravimetry, and it was understood that the mechanism of the thermal decomposition reactions consists of two successive exothermic thermal reactions. In the first thermal reaction, the energetic material was converted to furoxane compounds, and then, these furoxane compounds were decomposed by the second thermal reaction. Activation energies and Arrhenius pre-exponential factors of thermal responses were determined by using isothermal (Coats-Redfern) and nonisothermal/isoconvertional (Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall) methods with thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. With these calculated values, other thermodynamic parameters reaction enthalpy, entropy changes and free energy were calculated. Formation enthalpies of the elements of the energetic substances were theoretically calculated using the CBS-4M algorithm in the Gaussian 09 program for the synthesized energetic substances. In the thermal decomposition reactions, the products were estimated with the aid of literature data and the enthalpies of explosion reactions were theoretically calculated according to the Hess Law. Besides, the exothermic energies in the first and second thermal reactions of the energetic substances were measured by DSC. The results measured by DSC were compared with the calculated theoretical results and were found to be very close to each other. In the study, antimicrobial activity was estimated to be high because energetic molecules are strained molecules, and it is possible this tension can affect the medium. According to this thought, antimicrobial activity was determined by using five different bacteria and a fungus. Antimicrobial activity values were determined by ""agar dilution"" method, and results were found as minimum inhibition concentration. Among the three energetic substances, 2,6-dinitro-4-cyano-azidobenzene was found to have the most active compound.",2018
Modeling of the quenching of blast products from energetic materials by expansion into vacuum,"Condensed phase energetic materials include propellants and explosives. Their detonation or burning products generate dense, high pressure states that are often adjacent to regions that are at vacuum or near-vacuum conditions. An important chemical diagnostic experiment is the time of flight mass spectroscopy experiment that initiates an energetic material sample via an impact from a flyer plate, whose products expand into a vacuum. The rapid expansion quenches the reaction in the products so that the products can be differentiated by molecular weight detection as they stream past a detector. Analysis of this experiment requires a gas dynamic simulation of the products of a reacting multicomponent gas that flows into a vacuum region. Extreme computational difficulties can arise if flow near the vacuum interface is not carefully and accurately computed. We modify an algorithm proposed by Munz [1], that computed the fluxes appropriate to a gas-vacuum interface for an inert ideal gas, and extend it to a multi-component mixture of reacting chemical components reactions with general, non-ideal equations of state. We illustrate how to incorporate that extension in the context of a complete set of algorithms for a general, cell-based flow solver. A key step is to use the local exact solution for an isentropic expansion fan, for the mixture that connects the computed flow states to the vacuum. Regularity conditions (i.e. the Liu-Smoller conditions) are necessary conditions that must be imposed on the equation of state of the multicomponent fluid in the limit of a vacuum state. We show that the Jones, Wilkins, Lee (JWL) equation of state meets these requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2015
Nitroguanidine-Fused Bicyclic Guanidinium Salts: A Family of High-Density Energetic Materials,"A series of nitroguanidine-fused bicyclic guanidinium energetic salts paired with inorganic energetic anions, mono- and di-tetrazolate anions were synthesized through simple metathesis reactions of 2-iminium-5-nitriminooctahydroimidazo[4,5-d]imidazole chloride and sulfate with the corresponding silver and barium salts, respectively, in aqueous solution. Key physical properties, such as melting point, thermal stability, and density were measured. The relationship between the structures of the salts and these properties was determined. The salts exhibit thermal stability and density (>1.60 g cm(-3)) that are comparable to currently used explosives The structures of the nitrate salt 1 and the dinitrocyanomethanide salt 4 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Densities, heats of formation, detonation pressures and velocities, and specific impulses were calculated. All of the salts possess positive calculated heats of formation and most of them exhibit promising energetic performance that is comparable with those of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX). The effect of the fused bicycle 2-iminium-5-nitriminooctahydroimid-azo[4,5-d]imidazole on these physicochemical properties was examined and discussed.",2010
Mechanism of the Phenomenon of Negative Erosion during the Unsteady Combustion of Energetic Materials,"Over the last 60 years, a considerable amount of time and money has been spent improving our understanding of combustion instability in solid rocket propulsion systems. Research of the processes of non-stationary burning and anomalies of burning of the energetic materials (EM) opens essentially new possibilities for improvement of existing theories of burning of the EM. In real solid propulsion systems, combustion normally occurs under conditions of blowing, i.e., with motion of a hot combustion products (CP) along the burning surface of the EM. The phenomenon of reduction of the burning rate as a result of blowing of the solid propellant burning surface with low velocity of the CP of the same composition refers to as the effect of ""negative erosion"". The phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is one of typical anomalies of burning. Understanding of the mechanism of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is important from the point of view of formation of correct representations about fundamental laws of burning of the EM. Suggested new concept of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is developed on the basis of the Universal Concept of the spatial-periodic micro-structures excitation on the EM burning surface. All previous theoretical concepts did not take into account existence of pulsating micro-torch structures on the EM burning surface. Earlier it was assumed, that the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is exclusively gas-dynamics effect, which has not been connected with the processes in the liquid-viscous layer of the burning solid propellant. ""Wandering"" micro-torches on the burning surface causes excitation of the micro-vortex cells - periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures. This phenomenon is observed in the conditions of low pressure when the spatial-periodic micro-structures on the burning surfaces and the micro-torch structures have the maximal size. The mechanism of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is a mechanism of destruction of self-organised toroidal vortical structures over the burning surface, excited by the torch micro-structures on the burning surface. The boundary of existence of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is determined by stability of toroidal-shaped vortex micro-structures in the stream of the CP which is blowing the burning surface of the EM.",2009
Nitrogen-rich tetrazolium azotetrazolate salts:: A new family of insensitive energetic materials,"The metathesis reaction of sodium azotetrazolate with tetrazolium iodides 5and 6 at reflux in water yielded dihydrated species in both instances (1 and 3, respectively). However, when silver azotetrazolate (Ag(2)ZT) was used instead of the sodium salt in dry methanol, the anhydrous compounds 2 and 4 formed. An alternative synthesis for 2 and 4 that avoids handling highly sensitive Ag(2)ZT is introduced. All materials Were fully characterized by means of elemental analysis, mass spectrometry (MS), and vibrational (IR, Raman) and NMR (H-1, C-13) spectroscopy. Additionally, the crystal structures of the new compounds were determined (1, monoclinic, P2(1)/C; 2-4, triclinic,P (1) over bar). A discussion of the hydrogen bonding by means of graph-set analysis is provided. The thermal behaviors of 1-4 and their constant volume energies of combustion were assessed by DSC and bomb calorimetry measurements, respectively. Their sensitivity to shock, friction, and electrostatic discharge was measured by submitting the compounds to standard tests. The detonation pressures and velocities were calculated from the energies of formation using the EXPL05 code (1, P = 20.2 GPa, D = 7820 in s(-1); 2, P = 20.0 GPa, D = 7803 m s(-1); 3, P = 22.4 GPa, D = 8090 m s(-1); and 4, P = 21.1 GPa, D = 7977 m s(-1). Lastly, the decomposition products were both calculated and experimentally determined.",2008
The influence of the number of fluorine atoms on the properties of energetic materials,"Developing high-energy, low-sensitivity energetic materials has long been a primary goal in this field. This article explores fluorine-containing energetic materials based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The study examines the impact of the number of fluorine atoms on the stability, energy, and crystal stacking of energetic materials. The results show that with the increase of the number of fluorine atoms, the stability of energetic materials gradually decreases. However, 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (A2) showed abnormal behavior and better stability compared to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (A1). With increasing fluorine atoms, the detonation velocity and pressure of energetic materials initially rise before declining. Energetic materials have varying nitrogen and oxygen contents, and the number of fluorine atoms in compounds with the highest detonation velocity and pressure also varies. The intermolecular interactions facilitated by fluorine atoms in crystal stacking include intermolecular hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding. These results can provide a theoretical basis for the design of future energetic or fluorinated materials. Compound A2 was synthesized through a onestep nitration process using 1,3-difluorobenzene as the raw material, and its structure was confirmed. Compound A2 demonstrates consistent safety characteristics as anticipated: a thermal decomposition temperature exceeding 400 degrees C, impact sensitivity of 50 J, and friction sensitivity of 360 N. It has been established that there is potential for coordinating high energy content with safety features in energetic materials.",2024
"Recent advances on the nitrogen-rich 1,2,4-oxadiazole-azoles-based energetic materials","This review covers recent advances in the synthesis and energetic performance of nitrogen-rich 1,2,4oxadiazole-azoles-based energetic materials. These materials comprise of 1,2,4-oxadiazole subunit as a key structural motif linked to different nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-oxygen azoles: tetrazole, furazan, furoxan, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, pyrazole, and triazole. Particular attention is devoted to the introduction of various energetic groups including nitro, nitramino, azo, azoxy, dinitromethyl, trinitroethyl moieties, and their combination. The physicochemical and available performance parameters including density, decomposition temperature, heat of formation, detonation pressure, detonation velocity, impact sensitivity, and friction sensitivity of typical energetic compounds are also provided and analyzed. Eventually, it was obtained that several screened compounds exhibit superior detonation properties and outstanding insensitivities, which can be classified as a new family of high-performance energetic materials. Additionally, 1,2,4-oxadiazole-azoles-based energetic materials still have many thorough works to further exploited and studied, expecting to get very promising insensitive high explosives for practical application and industrialization.",2022
High-Pressure Experimental and DFT-D Structural Studies of the Energetic Material FOX-7,"This work reports the hydrostatic compression of the perdeuterated alpha-form of FOX-7 using neutron powder diffraction to follow the structural changes up to 4.58 GPa at room temperature. The equation of state for the hydrostatic compression of the alpha-form over the range 0-4.14 GPa has been determined, and a phase transition was observed over the pressure range 3.63-4.24 GPa. On the basis of dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations performed on the gamma-form over a range of pressures, the high-pressure form observed in the neutron diffraction experiments can unambiguously be identified as being different from the gamma-form and should therefore be denoted as the e-form. Based on similarities between the simulated and experimental powder diffraction patterns of the gamma- and epsilon-forms, it is suggested that the epsilon-form adopts a planar, layered structure. The structural responses to pressure of the alpha-form observed experimentally are reproduced by DFT-D calculations, but in-depth analysis of the bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and vibrational frequencies calculated in the DFT-D simulations identified a very subtle second-order phase transition at 1.9 GPa. This corroborates results obtained from previous far- and mid-IR vibrational spectroscopic studies. These very small changes in molecular geometry do not manifest themselves in either the measured or calculated lattice parameters or unit-cell volumes and are much smaller than can be detected by diffraction experiments. The results of phonon calculations were compared with experimental inelastic neutron scattering measurements and were used to investigate the effect of pressure on the heat capacities of alpha-FOX-7. The simulations predict very weak pressure dependencies (approximately -1 J K-1 mol(-1) GPa(-1)), in accordance with the conclusions reached in our previous studies of the energetic material RDX.",2015
Influence of Laser Wavelength on the Critical Energy Density for Initiation of Energetic Materials,"Critical densities of the energy of laser initiation of PETN containing nanoscale aluminum inclusions at radiation wavelengths of 1064 and 532 nm were measured experimentally. The critical initiation-energy density that corresponds to a 50%th probability of explosion was 1.15 J/cm(2) for the first harmonic of a neodymium laser and 0.7 J/cm(2) for the second. The dependence of the efficiency of radiation absorption by aluminum on the size of metal nanoparticles for the first and second harmonics of a neodymium laser is calculated. It is shown that the particle diameter corresponding to the absorption efficiency maximum and the amplitude of the maximum depend on the radiation wavelength. The absorption efficiency maximum for the first harmonic is observed in an inclusion 204 nm in diameter, and for the second, in an inclusion 96 nm in diameter. The amplitude of the maximum increases from 0.351 at a wavelength of 1064 nm to 0.490 at a wavelength of 532 nm. Dependences of the critical initiation energy density for energetic materials on the radius of metallic nanoparticles are calculated.

"Synthesis, characterization, testing, and detonation performance studies of fused pyrazole-based fluorescent energetic materials","Experts in the field of high energy materials strive to maintain a fine balance between energy and stability using nitrogen-rich materials and to apply sustainable development principles. Among the heterocyclic backbones, fused moieties are considered a significant backbone in energetic materials owing to their high energy content, dense nature, and stability. We have synthesized pyrazole-based fused compounds with high thermal stability, insensitivity, and moderate detonation performance to contribute to this development. All the compounds were isolated without column chromatography in one or two steps using commercially available affordable starting materials with excellent yields. Their molecular structure, crystallization, physicochemical properties, thermal stability and sensitivity behaviour were evaluated and compared with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexanitrostilbene (HNS), and 3,5-dinitro-N,N'-bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) (PYX). All the compounds show acceptable detonation velocities (VOD: 7344-8068 m s(-1)), pressures (DP: 19-24.5 GPa), and insensitive to impact (25 - > 40 J) and friction (360 N). Among all the compounds, ammonium salt of 4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-d] [1,2,3]triazin-6-ide (6) shows good density (1.77 g cm(-3)), detonation velocity (8068 m s(-1)) as well as 4-aminopyrimidine 5-oxide (13) shows good physicochemical properties (d: 1.85 g cm(-3), VOD: 7924 m s(-1)) Along with excellent insensitivity to impact and friction (35 - > 40 J and >360 N, respectively). These properties suggest that this can be a suitable replacement for benchmark explosives such as TNT, HNS, and PYX. Interestingly 4-amino-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-5-oxide (3) exhibits fluorescence property, which can be used as a potential candidate in energetic filler or the formulations of energetic material for easy detection.",2023
Evaluation of solvate and co-crystal screening methods for CL-20 containing energetic materials,"The difficulty synthesizing new co-crystals has made the development of efficient methods for screening co-formers a high priority. Co-crystals have been realized as a new generation of materials with tuneable solubility, stability, and performance. Energetic co-formers have exceptionally weak intermolecular interactions making selection of co-crystallization method and parameters critical to forming a true co-crystal. COSMO-RS calculations coupled with the COSMOtherm software suite were used to screen common solvents and co-formers for CL-20. The predicted favorable solvates and co-crystal formers were compared to experimentally confirmed solvates and co-crystals to assess the accuracy of the COSMO method for CL-20-based materials. It was found that screening solvents using excess enthalpy and solvent cavity volume were able to predict experimentally confirmed CL-20 solvates. Co-crystal formation was difficult to predict using the COSMO method, highlighting the importance of entropy and solid-state interactions. The selection of good solvents is perhaps the best method for maximizing entropy. Understanding the dependence on entropy for energetic-energetic cocrystal formation coupled with an accurate method for screening co-crystal formation allows for intelligent design of co-crystallization methods.",2022
Customization of the molecular structure to modulate the crystal packing style of energetic materials,"The crystal packing style of energetic compounds has a significant impact on their safety. Herein, using Multiwfn, the interactions of ANPZ (2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine) and DMDNP (2,6-dimethoxyl-3,5-dinitropyrazine), having the same dinitro-pyrazine ring with different crystal packing styles, were visualized to investigate the assembly of the corresponding crystal packing styles. Via the customization of the molecular structure, A1 and A2 compounds were synthesized to regulate the interactions to achieve the other two crystal packing styles. To further utilize this strategy and balance the contradiction between the energy content and safety of the energetic materials, the compound A3 was customized by the addition of an N-O group into the structure of A1. The crystal was modulated into a more impact-insensitive packing style while maintaining similar energy content as that in A1. All these results confirm that this strategy can be utilized to design and synthesize novel insensitive energetic materials.",2019
Experimental Study on Reaction Characteristics of PTFE/Ti/W Energetic Materials under Explosive Loading,"Metal/fluoropolymer composites represent a new category of energetic structural materials that release energy through exothermic chemical reactions initiated under shock loading conditions. This paper describes an experiment designed to study the reaction characteristics of energetic materials with low porosity under explosive loading. Three PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)/Ti/W mixtures with different W contents are processed through pressing and sintering. An inert PTFE/W mixture without reactive Ti particles is also prepared to serve as a reference. Shock-induced chemical reactions are recorded by high-speed video through a narrow observation window. Related shock parameters are calculated based on experimental data, and differences in energy release are discussed. The results show that the reaction propagation of PTFE/Ti/W energetic materials with low porosity under explosive loading is not self-sustained. As propagation distance increases, the energy release gradually decreases. In addition, reaction failure distance in PTFE/Ti/W composites is inversely proportional to the W content. Porosity increased the failure distance due to higher shock temperature.",2016
Detection of Highly Energetic Materials on Non-Reflective Substrates Using Quantum Cascade Laser Spectroscopy,"A quantum cascade laser spectrometer was used to obtain the reflection spectra of highly energetic materials (HEMs) deposited on nonideal, low-reflectivity substrates, such as travel-bag fabric (polyester), cardboard, and wood. Various deposition methods were used to prepare the standards and samples in the study. The HEMS used were the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), the aliphatic nitrate ester pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and the aliphatic nitramine 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Chemometrics algorithms were applied to analyze the recorded spectra. Partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis was used to find the best correlation between the infrared signals and the surface concentrations of the samples, and PLS combined with discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to discriminate, classify, and identity similarities in the spectral datasets. Several preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the mid-infrared spectra of HEMs deposited on the target substrates. The results demonstrate that the infrared vibrational method described in this study is well suited for the rapid screening analysis of HEMs on low-reflectivity substrates when a supervised model has been previously constructed or when a reference spectrum of the clean substrate can be acquired to be subtracted from the HEM-substrate spectrum.",2015
3-Nitro-1-(2,"A new family of nitrogen-rich energetic salts based on 3-nitro-1-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine (HANTT) were synthesized and characterized by H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The crystal structures of neutral HANTT (2), its guanidinium salt (3), and 1,5-diamino-tetrazolium salt (9) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All energetic salts exhibit excellent thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures ranging within 264-321 degrees C and are insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge. The densities of salts 3-10 ranged from 1.65 g cm(-3) to 1.81 g cm(-3). Theoretical performance calculations (Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5) provided detonation pressures and velocities for the energetic salts within the ranges of 22.6-32.6 GPa and 7742-8779 m s(-1), respectively, making them competitive energetic materials.",2015
Information self-destruction module design based on micro thermoelectric power generation and energetic materials,"Information self-destruction modules (ISDMs) play a vital role in the information security area. In this paper, an ISDM based on the integration of a micro-thermoelectric generation mechanism (MTEGM) with energetic materials (EMs) is proposed. On the basis of energy conversion relationship, an open-loop electromotive force is induced, and this energy will drive the EMs to release the detonation wave and realize information storage module self-destruction. During the tests, under the temperature difference (100 K), the open-loop electromotive force (3.86 V) is induced by the M-TEGM and can drive the EMs (0.37 mg copper azide) to generate a detonation wave (GPa) in 3.4 mu s, which can physically destroy the information storage modules. This ISDM has advantages that include rapid response times, low drive energy compared with traditional information security technology. (c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Computational investigation of the heat of formation, detonation properties of furazan-based energetic materials","The heats of formation (HOFs) for a series of furazan-based energetic materials were calculated by density functional theory. The isodesmic reaction method was employed to estimate the HOFs. The result shows that the introductions of azo and azoxy groups can increase the HOF, but the introduction of azo group can increase the more HOF, when compared with azoxy group. The detonation velocities and detonation pressures of the furazan-based energetic materials are further evaluated at B3LYP/6-31G* level. Dioxoazotetrafurazan and azoxytetrafurazan may be regarded as the potential candidates of high-energy density materials because of good detonation performance. In addition, there are good linear correlations between OB and detonation velocities, and OB and detonation pressures. The energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO of the studied compounds are also investigated. These results provide basic information for the molecular design of novel high-energy density materials.",2013
Advances in Aluminum Powder Usage as an Energetic Material and Applications for Rocket Propellant,Energetic materials have been widely used for military purposes. Continuous research programs are performing in the world for the development of the new materials with higher and improved performance comparing with the available ones in order to fulfill the needs of the military in future. Different sizes of aluminum powders are employed to produce composite rocket propellants with the bases of Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) and Hydroxyl-Terminated-Polybutadiene (HTPB) as oxidizer and binder respectively.

A zwitterionic fused-ring framework as a new platform for heat-resistant energetic materials,"Owing to their significant application potential in national defense and aerospace technology, the development of energetic materials with high heat resistance and high energy has attracted great attention recently. Herein, a zwitterionic strategy was explored for the preparation of a new heat-resistant energetic material. Through this strategy, a zwitterionic energetic material, 2,6-diamino-9-iminio-3,5-dinitro-9H-dipyrazolo[1,5-a:5 ',1 '-d][1,3,5]triazin-4-ide (ZDPT), was prepared employing a simple method. The molecular and crystal structures of ZDPT were comprehensively examined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The unique zwitterionic structure of ZDPT is rarely observed in energetic materials. ZDPT exhibited exceptionally high thermal stability with an onset decomposition temperature of 347 degrees C and a peak temperature of 380 degrees C, which was higher than that of most traditional heat-resistant energetic materials and the highest among energetic zwitterions and energetic ion salts. Moreover, ZDPT exhibited excellent energy performance and surprisingly low sensitivity. The detonation velocity was 8390 m s-1, which outperformed that of many heat-resistant energetic materials. The impact sensitivity and fraction sensitivity of ZDPT were higher than 40 J and 360 N, respectively. The extremely high thermal stability and low mechanical sensitivity were strongly related to the zwitterionic structure and the presence of a large pi electron conjugation system of ZDPT making ZDPT a potential candidate for heat-resistant energetic materials. A zwitterionic fused-ring based energetic material (ZDPT) was prepared. ZDPT has excellent thermal stability (Td = 347 degrees C ) and great detonation velocity (D = 8390 m s-1), which endow ZDPT with great potential as a heat-resistant energetic material.",2024
Design of Zero Oxygen Balance Energetic Materials on the Basis of Diels-Alder Chemistry,"Herein, a novel zero oxygen balance polycyclic energetic compound trans-3,3,4,4,7,7,8,8-octanitro-9,10-dioxatricyclo[4.2.1.1(2,5)]-decane (trans-BIT) was designed and expected to exhibit high crystal density (rho = 2.06 g/cm(3)), outstanding detonation performance (D = 9.473 km/s, P = 42.2 GPa), and promising thermostability and sensitivity. We proposed that the synthesis of this compound could be achieved via a facile Diels-Alder reaction, using tetranitroethylene and oxadiazole as starting materials. We also predicted that the crystal structure of trans-BIT would have P2(1)/C space group symmetry.",2018
A computational framework for predicting the combustion of energetic materials in an expanding chamber,"Purpose Various simplifications are introduced into the establishment of numerical models for problems with strong nonlinear interactions. The combustion of energetic materials in a chamber with moving boundaries is a typical example. This paper aims to establish a coupled numerical model for predicting the internal combustion in a launch process. Design/methodology/approach A two-fluid model is used to predict the fluid field induced by the propellant combustion. The moving boundary is located by using a finite element method. Based on a user subroutine interface in the commercial software ABAQUS, the development of the fluid field and the mechanical interactions is coupled with each other. Findings The paper is devoted to provide a coupled computational framework for predicting the propellant combustion in an expanding chamber.

Prediction of the Density of Energetic Materials on the Basis of their Molecular Structures,"The density of an energetic compound is an essential parameter for the assessment of its performance. A simple method based on quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) has been developed to give an accurate prediction of the crystal density of more than 170 polynitroarenes, polynitroheteroarenes, nitroaliphatics, nitrate esters and nitramines as important classes of energetic compounds, by suitable molecular descriptors. The evaluation techniques included cross-validation, validation through an external test set, and Y-randomization for multiple linear regression (MLR) and training state analysis for artificial neural network (ANN), and were used to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed models. The predicted MLR results are close to the experimental data for both the training and the test molecular sets, and for all of the molecular sets, but not as close as the ANN results. The ANN model was also used with 20 hidden neurons that gave good result. The results showed high quality for nonlinear modelling according to the squared regression coefficients for all of the training, validation and the test sets (R-2 = 0.999, 0.914 and 0.931, respectively). The calculated results have also been compared with those from several of the best available predictive methods, and were found to give more reliable estimates.",2016
Doping HTPB binder with cellulose nitrate: A promising strategy for advanced energetic material applications,"This study explored the characteristics of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) supplemented with cellulose nitrate (NC), as a high-energy density binder. The effect of NC doping and its content on the chemical structure, morphology, energetic, and thermokinetic behavior of HTPB-NC binder highlighted attractive features such as good compatibility, improved density, homogeneity, and fiber dispersion. Additionally, HTPB-NC exhibited excellent thermal stability with significant energy release and notable chemical reactivity. These interesting properties of the HTPB-NC binder, provide evidence for the excellent synergistic effect between HTPB and NC, which could promote its application in the next generation of energetic propellant formulations.",2023
Impact of regiochemistry on thermal stability of trifuroxan based energetic materials: A theoretical perspective,"Improving the stability of energetic materials with high energy density has been an issue over the past decades. Regioisomerism, as an effective molecular modification strategy, shows the potential to improve the thermal stability of energetic materials without a compromise in energy density. In this study, the impacts of regioisomerism on thermal stabilities of two trifuroxan based energetic regioisomers (BFTF-1 and BFTF-2) have been thoroughly investigated. The initial decomposition mechanism has been studied to reveal the decomposition process. According to the Gibbs free energy profiles, NO2-dissociation path is proved as the primary decomposition path for both regioisomers, and the difference in energy also well explains their distinct thermal stabilities. The regioisomerism impacts on molecular structure and NO2 connection have been evaluated through intramolecular interactions and electron effects. The structure of BFTF-2 has been stabilized by an intramolecular electrostatic attraction, the connection of the leaving NO2 group in BFTF-1 has been weakened by intramolecular steric effect, both of which result in different thermal stabilities of BFTF-1 and BFTF-2.",2022
Enhancing chemical stability of tetranitro biimidazole-based energetic materials through co-crystallization,"Co-crystallization technology was employed as a way of solving two problems hampering the usefulness of 4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-2,2'biimidazole (TNBI) as a viable energetic material, namely hygroscopicity and corrosiveness (high acidity). Co-crystal screening was carried out with 15 co-formers containing nitrogen or oxygen as the primary hydrogen-bond acceptor site. Formation of co-crystals was confirmed by IR spectroscopy and DSC, and suitable co-crystals were then analysed via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In each case, the formation of a co-crystal was driven by the formation of multiple N-H center dot center dot center dot N or N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds between TNBI and the co-former. The N-oxide based acceptors produce better energetic materials due to a more optimal oxygen balance. Hygroscopicity evaluations and corrosion tests revealed that the unavailability of N-H protons in the co-crystals of TNBI reduce hygroscopicity and suppress the chemical acidity of the free parent compound thereby making it substantially easier to handle, store, and transport.",2020
Facile preparation of Si/CuO energetic materials by electrophoretic deposition and their exothermic studies,"Silicon (Si) with a thinner oxide layer than aluminum (Al) has attracted considerable interest in the fields of energetic materials. Herein, we report novel Si/CuO energetic materials fabricated by electrophoretic deposition methods. Electrophoretic deposition dynamics and exothermic behaviors of Si/CuO energetic materials were systematically analyzed in this study. Besides, chemical compositions and morphologies of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, respectively. The results demonstrate clearly that Si/CuO energetic materials can be employed as a secure energetic composite because of its high ignition temperature and low combustion rate. The insights obtained in this work provide inspiration for the investigation and development of Si-based energetic materials.",2019
Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy: Characterization of Laser-Induced Plasmas of Potassium-Based Energetic Materials,"Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is a widely applicable chemical sensing technique, which uses atomic and molecular emission spectra to identify chemical compounds. LIBS can identify the composition of materials in solid, liquid or gaseous states with little sample preparation, allowing for in-situ analysis of materials. The atomic emissions present in LIBS spectra are mostly in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (200-780 nm). However, LIBS has recently been extended to the mid-infrared (MIR) region to determine molecular composition using the resulting emissions from vibrational and rotational transitions of molecular fragments. In this thesis, LIBS spectra from potassium-based energetic materials were examined using a conventional nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser and an eye-safe laser operating at 1574 nm. The goals were to determine atomic and molecular LIBS signatures in the UV-VIS and IR region and to apply the Boltzmann method to calculate the plasma temperature.",2018
Dependence of the parameters of thermal decomposition of energetic materials on the experiment conditions,"The causes of large scatter of the published data on the kinetic parameters of thermal decomposition of energetic materials, determined by methods of thermal analysis, are analyzed. It is shown that this scatter is mainly due to different contribution of secondary reactions involving gaseous products in devices differing in the design of the measurement cells. The influence of nitrogen pressure in the interval 1-100 bar on the characteristics of thermal decomposition of HMX and ammonium perchlorate in open measurement cells (crucibles with perforated lids) is examined by DSC. An increase in pressure leads to significant changes in the temperature intervals, in the shape of the heat release peaks, and in the heat of the overall decomposition reaction, Delta De (d). The kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of HMX, calculated from the results of experiments in open and sealed crucibles at heating rates of 0.1-1.0 deg min(-1), are compared.",2015
Controlling the electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity of composite energetic materials using carbon nanotube additives,"Powder energetic materials are highly sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD) ignition. This study shows that small concentrations of carbon nanotubes (CNT) added to the highly reactive mixture of aluminum and copper oxide (Al + CuO) significantly reduces ESD ignition sensitivity. CNT act as a conduit for electric energy, bypassing energy buildup and desensitizing the mixture to ESD ignition. The lowest CNT concentration needed to desensitize ignition is 3.8 vol.% corresponding to percolation corresponding to an electrical conductivity of 0.04 S/cm. Conversely, added CNT increased Al + CuO thermal ignition sensitivity to a hot wire igniter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014
Biomass materials self-assembled core-shell CL-20 @Biomass materials-TiO2 energetic composites with reduced impact sensitivity and enhanced thermal stability,"Recently, nano -titanium dioxide (TiO2) had attracted much attention because it was a potential desensitizing material. However, it was still a great challenge to coat nano-TiO2 on the surface of energetic materials. To enhance the interface interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL -20), the surface of titanium dioxide was modified using green and biocompatible tea polyphenols (TP) and dopamine (DA). In this research, the core -shell CL -20 @TP-TiO2 and CL -20 @DA-TiO2 energetic composites were successfully prepared by In -situ polymerization. The prepared CL -20 @TP-TiO2 and CL -20 @DA-TiO2 were analyzed by a series of characterization techniques. The safety test results indicate that TP-TiO2 and DA-TiO2 can effectively form a protective layer on the surface of CL -20, which can reduce the friction, extrusion, and impact between energetic crystal particles, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the energetic materials and improving their thermal stability.",2024
"Novel micron- and nano-scale energetic materials for advanced gun propulsion, their material properties, and their effects on ballistic performance","This dissertation focused on the investigation of novel materials that are both energetic and inert in their micron- and nano-scale crystalline form. The characterization of the materials properties and its effects on the ballistic performance when incorporated into a composite material were evaluated as a gun propellant for application in a future weapon system for the US Army. Some of these materials may find dual use in civilian applications. Applications in small and medium arms, artillery, tank, aircraft, and shipboard gun systems will all benefit from these advancements. Not only will gun system performance be improved for greater stand-off range and accuracy, but the ability to perform consistently across a broad temperature range. Additionally, an improved performance and longer gun barrel life achievable by tailoring the combustion products, lowering the propellant flame temperature, minimum sensitivity of burning velocity to pressure, temperature and gas velocity (erosive burning) and with munitions that are insensitive to outside stimulus attack will give such systems a significant advantage during military use. In addition, ""green"" chemistry and lower lifecycle cost were taken into consideration during this research. The approach to be taken was to incorporate these novel materials into a gun propellant formulation by using nitramine-based micron scale cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) explosives in combination with synthesized novel ingredients in nanoscale crystalline form, characterize the material properties and predict the ballistic performance across the ballistic temperature range. The nano-scale crystalline materials evaluated consisted of polymeric nitrogen stabilized in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), nitrogenated boron nanotubes / nanofibers (BNNTsBNNFs), nano-aluminum, and titanium dioxide. The polymeric nitrogen and the nitrogenated boron nanotubes / nanofibers (BNNTsBNNFs), should provide an enhancement in the propellant burn rate by achieving the burn rate differential goal of 3:1 between the fast and the slow burning propellant and at the same time improve the gun propellant performance by lowering the CO/CO 2 ratio and raising the N 2 / CO ratio for mitigating gun bore wear and erosion, respectively. For the synthesis approaches of polymeric nitrogen stabilized in carbon nanotubes, the following synthesis method were performed, optimized and compared: Electrochemical Reactions, Microwave Induced Electrochemical Chemical Reactions and Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD). The Electrochemical Reaction process has proven to be the most efficient synthesis approach for the polymeric nitrogen based on analytical results obtained through Raman Spectroscopy, Laser Ablation Mass Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and Differential Scanning Calorimeter/Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DSC/TGA). The PE-CVD is the second recommended synthesis approach to synthesize the polymeric nitrogen although a cost benefit economic analysis has to be performed which is beyond the objectives of this research work. For the synthesis of the nitrogenated boron nanotubes, the use of the magnesium borohydride to initiate the reaction has proven to be the most optimized process due to a much lower reaction temperature which is approximately 500 °C when compared with the reaction temperature of 950 °C when using Magnesium Boride (MgB2) in the thermally induced CVD process. The small scale synthesis of boron nanotubes /nanofibers carried out using MgB 2 powder, Nickel Boride (Ni 2 B) powder catalysts and mesostructured hexagonal framework zeolite powder was successfully achieved at 950C. The quality of the nanotubes produced was checked by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope analysis. The TEM data shows the production of 10-20 nm boron nanotubes using the MgB2, Ni2B and Mobile Crystalline Material (MCM-41) in the synthesis process.",2010
Co-combustion strategy of waste energetic materials with pine sawdust for efficient NOx emissions reduction,"Excessive NOx emissions during incineration of waste energetic materials (EMs) is harmful to the environment. Co-combustion technologies with biomass have demonstrated remarkable advantages in reducing NOx emissions. Herein, the co-combustion characteristics and NOx emission behaviors of waste double-base propellant (DP) and pine sawdust (PS) were investigated via thermogravimetric (TG) and fixed-bed experiments firstly. Meanwhile, the general full factorial design (GFFD) was performed to explore the effects of different factors on the NOx emissions of co-combustion. The interaction mechanism between DP and PS was discussed as well. Moreover, the interaction of three other typical waste EMs (RDX, TNT, and triple-base propellant) co-combustion with PS in NOx emissions was studied utilizing orthogonal experiments. The kinetics under air atmosphere indicated that the mixing of PS slightly diminished the combustion reactivity of DP, conversely, the remaining residue of DP combustion promoted the combustion of PS. Oxygen concentration, temperature and mixing ratio all had significant effects on NOx emissions of co-combustion between DP and PS, the degree of effect decreased in turn. Overall, the mixing of PS all suppressed the NOx emissions with significant synergistic effects, optimal synergistic effect at 20 wt% of PS mixing. The synergistic effect in oxygen environment was lower than that in oxygen-free environment. Meanwhile, increasing temperature contributed to enlarging the synergistic effect. Additionally, there was synergistic effect of TNT and PS co-combustion, whereas RDX, TP exerted inhibition effect of cocombustion with PS. Therefore, the co-combustion strategy of waste EMs with PS provides reliable data support and guidance for the control of NOx emissions during the incineration of waste EMs.",2024
Molecular dynamics insight into the evolution of AlH,"Adding AlH3 nanoparticles (AHNPs) into energetic materials has become a widely used strategy to enhance the efficiency of heat release. However, the underlying mechanisms in the reaction between AHNPs and energetic materials are poorly understood. The evolution of AHNPs in 2,2 ',4,4 ',6,6 '-hexanitrodiphenyl ethylene (HNS) was simulated by reactive dynamic based on ReaxFF force field. As a whole, adding AHNPs unexceptionally increases heat release, and the particle size, passivation shell, and contents of AHNPs influence the morphological evolution and hydrogen release performance. AHNPs with smaller size can rapidly release hydrogen under the drastic micro-explosion. In addition, the aggregation mechanism of AHNPs is revealed at the earlier and later stages of the reaction. Al-O, Al-C, and Al-N bonds are generated during the reaction. A large amounts of H of AHNPs and C of HNS cause O to be desorbed from the Al-contained cluster. For the core-shell structure or/and larger size AHNPs, their oxidation process undergoes a transformation of H-2-H2O in the gas cavity. Carbon clusters formed during the reaction depend on the distribution of Al. The addition of AHNPs could promote the graphitization of carbon clusters. This work is expected to deepen insight into the reaction mechanism of AHNPs-containing energetic materials with negative oxygen balance.",2021
Construct 3D porous hollow Co,"High energy density and rapid reactivity are the future trend for nano-energetic materials. Energetic performance of nano-energetic materials depends on the interfacial diffusion and mass transfer during the reacted process. However, the development of desired structure to significantly enhance reactivity still remains challenging. Here we focused on the design and preparation of 3D porous hollow Co3O4 micro-spheres, in which gas-blowing agents (air) and maximize interfacial interactions were introduced to enhance mass transport and reduce the diffusion distance between the oxidizer and fuel (Aluminum). The 3D hierarchical Co3O4/Al based nano-energetic materials show a low-onset decomposition temperature (423 degrees C), and high heat output (3118 J g(-1)) resulting from porous and hollow nano-structure of Co3O4 micro-spheres. Furthermore, 3D hierarchical Co3O4/Al arrays were directly fabricated on the silicon substrate, which was fully compatible with silicon-based microelectromechanical systems to achieve functional nanoenergetics-on-a-chip. This approach provides a simple and efficient way to fabricate 3D ordered nano-energetic arrays with superior reactivity and the potential on the application in micro-energetic devices.

Energy output characteristics and safety design of Al-AlH,"Aluminum (Al) is the most widely used metal additive in energetic materials, but its application is limited due to its oxidizable nature. However, aluminum hydride (AlH3) could disrupt the oxide film structure and improve applications of the Al additive in energetic materials by releasing hydrogen. Therefore, this paper explored the explosion characteristics of the Al-AlH3 composite dust by conducting composite dust explosion venting experiments. The influences of composite dust concentrations and mass ratios on the explosion pressure and flame were evaluated. The consequences indicated that when the composite dust concentration was constant, the explosion pressure and the reduction rate of explosion pressure gradually decreased as increasing the mass ratio, which confirmed that the explosion intensity of AlH3 was greater than that of Al. When the composite dust mass ratio was the same, the increase in dust concentration caused the explosion pressure, the pressure rise rate, the flame front propagation distance, and velocity to increase first and then attenuate. 750 g/m(3) was the best dust explosion concentration. On this basis, the safety design applicability of composite dust was conducted based on the NFPA 68 explosion venting design standard, which was verified to be suitable for Al dust. Notably, the safety margin should be taken into account when carrying out a safety design for composite dust using NFPA 68. In the paper, the composite dust explosion characteristics were obtained through experiments and mechanism analysis, which provided data support for the research of Al-AlH3 composite dust for energetic material additives.

The thermomechanics of particulate composite mock energetic materials in response to high-frequency (1-100kHz) excitation,"This work seeks to explore the macroscale, thermomechanical response of polymer-bonded composite energetic materials in their inert form to high-frequency mechanical excitation in the range of 1-100 kHz. Cylindrical samples were fabricated according to a mock PBXN-109 formulation, consisting of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, mock RDX material (sucrose), and varying ratios of spherical aluminum powder. Experiments were performed utilizing laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography in order to analyze the thermal and mechanical response of the samples when mechanically excited using a piezoelectric shaker. Thermal analysis of the samples revealed temperature rises on the order of 4 degrees C/min, with several samples reaching 100 degrees C within a 15 min experiment. Generally, formulations containing a higher weight percentage of aluminum additive content tended to exhibit greater temperature increases than those with pure sucrose embedded in the binder. The investigation presented herein serves as an advancement toward the complete characterization of these composite materials in this frequency range.

Theoretical study of the N-NO,"The N-NO2 bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for 7 energetic materials were computed by means of accurate density functional theory (B3LYP, B3PW91 and B3P86) with 6-31G** and 6-311G** basis sets. By comparing the Computed energies and experimental results, we find that the B3P86/6-311G** method can give good results of BDE, which has the mean absolute deviation of 1.30 kcal/mol. In addition, substituent effects were also taken into account. It is noted that the Hammett constants of substituent groups are related to the BDEs of the N-NO2 bond and the bond dissociation energies of the energetic materials studied decrease when increasing the number of NO2 group.",2008
Hybrid carbon thermal interface materials for thermoelectric generator devices,"Thermal interface materials (TIMs) are extensively used in electronic devices as efficient heat transfer materials. We fabricated all-carbon TIMs by hybridizing single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with graphite and demonstrated their performance by applying them to a thermoelectric generator (TEG) device. The hybrid carbon TIM exhibited maximum thermal conductivity when the SWCNT content was near 10 wt%. The TIM thermal contact resistance measured by a home-made calorimeter setup was 2.19x10(-4 )m(2)K/W, which did not vary with temperature but decreased with applied pressure. Post-treatment of the TIM with a silane coupling agent further reduced the TIM thermal contact resistance by 30%. When the TIM was placed between a TEG device and a copper heat reservoir, the TEG output power increased with the temperature difference across the TEG and applied pressure. Moreover, the post-treatment of the TIM enhanced the output power of the TEG device by up to 18.5%. This work provides a simple and effective pathway towards a carbon-based TIM that can be applied to a high temperature TEG.",2020
Host-guest energetic materials constructed by incorporating oxidizing gas molecules into an organic lattice cavity toward achieving highly-energetic and low-sensitivity performance,"A promising strategy for the preparation of novel gas inclusion host-guest energetic materials was provided by incorporating powerful oxidizer N2O into the crystal lattice cavity of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazatetracyclododecane (HNIW). The HNIW/N2O complex crystal exhibits a surprisingly high crystallographic density (2.038 g cm(-3) at 298 K), more thermal stability, better predicted detonation properties and lower sensitivity compared to e-HNIW due to its enhanced packing density, improved oxidation effect and added heat-release after N2O insertion.",2019
Infrared (1-12 μm) Atomic and Molecular Emission Signatures from Energetic Materials using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy,"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a powerful analytical technique to detect the elemental composition of solids, liquids, and gases in real time. For example, recent advances in UV-VIS LIBS have shown great promise for applications in chemical, biological, and explosive sensing. The extension of conventional UV-VIS LIBS to the near-IR (NIR), mid-IR (MIR) and long wave infrared (LWIR) regions (similar to 1-12 mu m) offers the potential to provide additional information due to IR atomic and molecular signatures. In this work, a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser operating at 1064 nm was employed as the excitation source and focused onto several chlorate and nitrate compounds including KClO3, NaClO3, KNO3, and NaNO3 to produce intense plasma at the target surface. IR LIBS studies on background air, KCl, and NaCl were also included for comparison. All potassium and sodium containing samples revealed narrow-band, atomic-like emissions assigned to transitions of neutral alkali-metal atoms in accordance with the NIST atomic spectra database. In addition, first evidence of broad-band molecular LIBS signatures from chlorate and nitrate compounds were observed at similar to 10 mu m and similar to 7.3 mu m, respectively. The observed molecular emissions showed strong correlation with FTIR absorption spectra of the investigated materials.",2013
Hydrogen Bond and π-π Stacking Interaction: Stabilization Mechanism of Two Metal ,"In recent years, cyclo-N-5(-) has attracted extensive attention because all-nitrogen high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) have been expected to reach a TNT equivalent of over 3.0. However, for cyclo-N-5(-)-containing HEDMs, the stabilization mechanism has remained enigmatic. In this study, two typical cyclo-N-5(-)-containing metal hydrates, [Na(H2O)(N-5)]center dot 2H(2)O (Na-cyclo-N-5(-)) and [Mg(H2O)(6)(N-5)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O (Mg-cyclo-N-5(-)), are selected to gain insights into the factors affecting their stability by the first-principles method. Both binding/lattice energy calculations and density of states analysis show that Mg-cyclo-N-5(-) is more stable than Na-cyclo-N-5(-). Hydrogen bonding is the main stabilization mechanism for stabilizing crystals and cyclo-N-5(-). Two types of hydrogen bonds, O-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot N, are clarified, which construct a 3D hydrogen bond network in Mg-cyclo-N-5(-) and an intralayer 2D hydrogen bond network in Na-cyclo-N-5(-). Moreover, nonuniform stress causes distortion of cyclo-N-5(-). Comparing the two samples, the distortion degree of cyclo-N-5(-) is higher in Na cyclo-N-5(-), which indicates that cyclo-N(5)(-)decomposition is easier. These findings will enhance the future prospects for the design and synthesis of cyclo-N-5(-)-containing HEDMs.",2022
Enhanced thermal- and impact-initiated reactions of PTFE/Al energetic materials through ultrasonic-assisted core-shell construction,"A facile and economical approach was developed for the large-scale production of powdered core-shell structured PTFE/Al (CS-PA) energetic materials through ultrasonic-assisted mixing. The low-cost micrometer-sized PTFE and Al particles were used as starting materials. Under high-power ultrasonic waves, the PTFE powder was dispersed into nano-to sub-micrometer-sized particles and then encapsulated the Al microparticles to form the core-shell structure. The heat of combustion, burning rate, and pressurization rate of the powdered CS-PA were measured. The thermal-initiated reaction behavior was further evaluated using thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. Subsequently, the bulk CSPA with a uniform microstructure was obtained via cold isostatic pressing of the powdered CS-PA followed by vacuum sintering. For the bulk CS-PA, the quasi-static compression behavior was characterized, and the impact-initiated reaction processes were conducted using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) and evaluated by a high-speed camera. Compared to physically mixed PTFE/Al materials, the powdered and bulk CS-PA demonstrated enhanced thermal- and impact-initiated reaction characteristics respectively, proving the effectiveness of our approach for constructing core-shell structures.

Potential space debris shield structure using impact-initiated energetic materials composed of polytetrafluoroethylene and aluminum,"A whipple shield using Al/PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) energetic material to protect against space debris is presented. The hypervelocity impact characteristics were investigated experimentally using a two-stage light gas gun at velocities between 3 and 6 km/s. A good protection of the shield was obtained through comparative experiments which used the same bumper areal density. The results showed that the critical projectile diameter can be improved by 28% by contrast with the Christiansen ballistic limit equations. The Al/PTFE energetic material bumper can break up the projectile into smaller, less massive, and slower projectiles due to the combined effect of impact and explosion, thereby producing a sharp rise in the spacecraft protection ability.

An Eulerian crystal plasticity framework for modeling large anisotropic deformations in energetic materials under shocks,"This paper demonstrates a novel Eulerian computational framework for modeling anisotropic elastoplastic deformations of organic crystalline energetic materials (EM) under shocks. While Eulerian formulations are advantageous for handling large deformations, constitutive laws in such formulations have been limited to isotropic elastoplastic models, which may not fully capture the shock response of crystalline EM. The present Eulerian framework for high-strain rates, large deformation material dynamics of EM incorporates anisotropic isochoric elasticity via a hypo-elastic constitutive law and visco-plastic single-crystal models. The calculations are validated against atomistic calculations and experimental data and benchmarked against Lagrangian (finite element) crystal plasticity computations for shock-propagation in a monoclinic organic crystal, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7 tetrazocine (beta-HMX). The Cauchy stress components and the resolved shear stresses calculated using the present Eulerian approach are shown to be in good agreement with the Lagrangian computations for different crystal orientations. The Eulerian framework is then used for computations of shock-induced inert void collapse in beta-HMX to study the effects of crystal orientations on hotspot formation under different loading intensities. The computations show that the hotspot temperature distributions and the collapse profiles are sensitive to the crystal orientations at lower impact velocities (viz., 500 m/s); when the impact velocity is increased to 1000 m/s, the collapse is predominantly hydrodynamic and the role of anisotropy is modest. The present methodology will be useful to simulate energy localization in shocked porous energetic material microstructures and other situations where large deformations of single and polycrystals govern the thermomechanical response.

"A high density and insensitive fused [1,2,3]triazolo-pyrimidine energetic material","A novel fused triazolo-pyrimidine energetic compound was synthesized by the two-step diazotization-nitrification method or one-step direct nitration reaction. The physical properties and detonation properties of intermediate 3H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine-5,7-diamine (2) and N-(7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-2H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5d]pyrimidin-5-yl)nitramide (3) were further explored. Compound 2 has a higher decomposition temperature (368 degrees C) than that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT, 295 degrees C). X-ray crystal-structure analysis shows that the density of compound 3 was 1.97 g cm(-3) at 100 K. Not only the detonation performance of compound 3 (8845 m s(-1), 32.54 GPa) was predicted to approach RDX (8795 m s(-1), 34.9 GPa) but displays significantly good safety properties (36 J), which means that compound 3 may serve as a potential high energy insensitivity material (HEIM).",2021
Energy Release Characteristics of Ni-Al-CuO Ternary Energetic Structural Material Processed by Cold Spraying,"Ternary energetic structural material (ESM) Ni-Al-CuO was prepared by cold spraying, and its mechanical properties studied under quasi-static-state and dynamic compression conditions. Energy release characteristics including the ignition temperature, energy release, and combustion wave velocity were characterized in both the thermal explosion and self-propagating combustion modes. The results reveal that the yield stress of Ni-Al-CuO is 50 MPa higher than that of Ni-Al. The initial reaction temperature was found to be 450 degrees C, much lower than the temperature of the reaction between Al and CuO and corresponding to the reaction of Ni and Al. In addition, more energy was released by Ni-Al-CuO ESM (859.2 J/g) than by Ni-Al (735.4 J/g). The combustion wave velocity of the Ni-Al-CuO coating was about 90 mm/s. Self-propagating combustion of Ni-Al-CuO proceeded via a multistage reaction, during which the Al-CuO reaction was triggered by the Ni-Al reaction. Graphic",2020
Experimental observation of the heat transfer mechanisms that drive propagation in additively manufactured energetic materials,"The rise of additive manufacturing has led to the development of new architectures and allowed researchers to 3D-print a variety of energetic composites with different formulations. However, reactive sintering within the composites can negatively impact overall performance of nanoenergetic or reactive materials via the loss of nanostructure. It has been previously proposed that the addition of a gas generator could reduce the impact of reactive sintering while enhancing reactivity. Iodine pentoxide (I2O5) is an extremely powerful oxidizer and a strong gas generator which has been proposed as an efficient source of molecular iodine for biocidal applications. However, fabricated Al/I2O5 nanocomposite propellants are unable to propagate. In this study, we demonstrate that the addition of small quantities of CuO enables consistent propagation. Employing high-speed pyrometry and microscopy, we estimate advective heat transfer in the system and demonstrate that the addition of CuO offers a pathway for enhanced energy-transfer by metal condensation that is not available when I2O5 is the sole oxidizer. Elimination of condensing metal vapor as a participant in energy transfer increased the reliance of the system on particle advection. Small additions of CuO yield a condensable product vapor which can effectively eliminate the reliance on heat transfer via advection, enabling consistent propagation in reactive solid materials. We conclude with a general comment that where reliable propagation is critical, such as a stable burn of a solid propellant or delivery of a biocide, small additions of an oxidizer with a condensable metal vapor could be the difference between guaranteed performance and critical failure.

The focus is on analyzing the effect of impact loading on microstructure-dependent material behavior. The temperature distribution is shown to be strongly correlated to the local material microstructure with the interface and particle shape playing a key role.,2019
"Theoretical investigation on heats of formation, detonation properties and sensitivities of TANPy based energetic materials","A series of 2,4,6-triamino-3,5-dinitropyridine (TANPy) based energetic compounds were designed and optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p). The results show that all the designed compounds have high positive heats of formation, and the tetrazole ring/-N3 was an beneficial combination to increase the heats of formation. The introduction of furazan-furazan/-C(NO2)3/-CH(NO2)2 combination was effective to improve the densities and detonation properties while the furazan-furazan or furazan-tetrazine rings was beneficial to improving the values of heats of detonation. Considering the detonation properties and sensitivities, compounds D2, E2, F2 were finally screened as potential high energy density materials and their physicochemical properties were fully investigated.",2024
Process Research of Solution-Enhanced Dispersion by Supercritical Fluids to Prepare Energetic Material Nano-Capsules,"Nano-capsule energetic materials can improve the mechanical properties, combustion/explosion properties, and component compatibility of solid propellants and reduce their toxicity, water absorption capacity, and sensitivity. The following approaches have been performed to obtain nano-capsule energetic materials. First, the structure of solution-enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS) core device (nozzle and hanging basket) were modified to improve the atomization performance, eliminate the vortex, and avoid the repeated growth of crystals. The ultrafine RDX particles with average particle size of 705 nm and distribution range of 400-1200 nm were prepared by using the improved devices. Second, the optimal process parameters for the preparation of ultrafine RDX by SEDS were obtained. Reducing the solution concentration or the supercritical CO2 temperature will be beneficial to obtain dry RDX particles with smaller particle sizes. When the solution concentration ratio was 10 g (RDX)/100 mL (DMF), the temperature of supercritical CO2 was 35 degrees C, and the flow rate ratio of supercritical CO2 to solution was greater than 10 (kg/h): 2 (ml/min), the experiment results were good. Third, to facilitate the detection of shell elements, fluororubber (F-26) and RDX were used as raw materials to prepare nano-capsules. Transmission electron microscopy image showed that the RDX-F-26 particles featured a core-shell structure with diameters that ranged between 200 nm and 300 nm, spherical shape, and uniform wall thickness. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the core was RDX, the shell was F-26, and the thickness of the shell was 14.6 nm. As the capsule wall material, the F-26 also inhibited the overgrowth of RDX crystal in the course of crystallization successfully. Sensitivity analysis showed that the RDX-F-26 nano-capsules had lower impact and friction sensitivities than the refined RDX. These results show that the use of improved SEDS process is suitable for the preparation of energetic material microcapsules.",2021
Energetic Multifunctionalized Nitraminopyrazoles and Their Ionic Derivatives: Ternary Hydrogen-Bond Induced High Energy Density Materials,"Diverse functionalization was introduced into the pyrazole framework giving rise to a new family of ternary hydrogen-bond induced high energy density materials. By incorporating extended cationic interactions, nitramine-based ionic derivatives exhibit good energetic performance and enhanced molecular stability. Performance parameters including heats of formation and detonation properties were calculated by using Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, respectively. It is noteworthy to find that 5-nitramino-3,4-dinitropyrazole, 4, has a remarkable measured density of 1.97 g cm(-3) at 298 K, which is consistent with its crystal density (2.032 g cm(-3), 150 K), and ranks highest among azole-based CHNO compounds. Energetic evaluation indicates that, in addition to the molecular compound 4, some ionic derivatives, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, and 22, also have high densities (1.83-1.97 g cm(-3)), excellent detonation pressures and velocities (P, 35.6-41.6 GPa; vD, 8880-9430 m s(-1)), as well as acceptable impact and friction sensitivities (IS, 4-30 J; FS, 40-240 N). These attractive features highlight the application potential of nitramino hydrogen-bonded interactions in the design of advanced energetic materials.",2015
Toward Addressing the Challenge to Predict the Heat Capacities of RDX and HMX Energetic Materials,"Availability of heat capacity as a function of pressure and temperature is an essential prerequisite for development of a computational multiscale strategy capable to address the evolution of microstructure and energy release in advanced high energy density materials. In the case of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) systems as two of the most studied energetic materials, there are substantial gaps in experimental data, with available heat capacities values distributed only in a region close to standard ambient conditions. In this study we demonstrate how these major experimental limitations can be addressed in the case of the RDX and HMX systems based on the combined use of classical and quantum mechanical calculations. We show that by considering ideal gas properties evaluated using quantum mechanical methods, and residual properties obtained from molecular simulations using fully flexible atomistic force field models, excellent agreement can be obtained for the predicted heat capacities to the most recent experimental values. An important advantage of the current computational methodology is that it allows evaluation of both constant-volume and constant-pressure heat capacities for a broad interval of temperatures and pressures, which encompasses solid and liquid phases conditions. In the case of the solid alpha and gamma phases of RDX and the beta phase of HMX, the predicted results follow closely both the available experimental data at standard ambient conditions and the results obtained using density functional theory calculations at high pressures, a regime where experimental data are not available. A perspective to expand the current methodology is also discussed.",2022
Energetic Materials Based on ,"The regularities and synthetic potentialities of the alkylation of 4(5)-nitro-1,2,3-triazole in basic media were explored, and new energetic ionic and nitrotriazole-based coordination compounds were synthesized in this study. The reaction had a general nature and ended with the formation of N1-, N2-, and N3-alkylation products, regardless of the conditions and reagent nature (alkyl- or aryl halides, alkyl nitrates, dialkyl sulfates). This reaction offers broad opportunities for expanding the variability of substituents on the nitrotriazole ring in the series of primary and secondary aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic substituents, which is undoubtedly crucial for solving the problems related to both high-energy materials development and medicinal chemistry when searching for new efficient bioactive compounds. An efficient methodology for the separation of regioisomeric N-alkyl(aryl)nitrotriazoles has been devised and relies on the difference in their basicity and reactivity during quaternization and complexation reactions. Based on the inaccessible N3-substitution products that exhibit a combination of properties of practical importance, a series of energy-rich ionic systems and coordination compounds were synthesized that are gaining ever-increasing interest for the chemistry of energy-efficient materials, coordination chemistry, and chemistry of ionic liquids.",2022
Bonding analysis of the effect of strain on trigger bonds in organic-cage energetic materials,"Wiberg bond index and natural bond orbital analyses were used to examine the effect of strain on trigger bonds for a series of organic-cage molecules. In substituted cage hydrocarbons, weakening of the interior C-C bonds and strengthening of exterior C-X bonds are explained in terms of the contributions of the carbon 2s and 2p atomic orbitals to the bonds. The interior C-C, rather than C-NO2, bonds are expected to break to initiate explosive decomposition in nitro-substituted tetrahedranes, prismanes, and cubanes. Activation of C-C bonds in cage molecules increases with nitro substitution, but persubstituted cages are not necessarily the most activated. For example, heptanitrocubane is predicted to be more sensitive than octanitrocubane, consistent with experimental studies. In contrast, for a series of hypothetical nitroester substituted prismanes, the strengthening of the exterior C-ONO2 bond weakens the O-NO2 bond more than the interior C-C bonds. In CL-20 and TEX, cage strain as determined by WBI analysis in the fused five- and six-membered rings is less significant than for the cage hydrocarbon. In these known energetic materials, the N-NO2 trigger bonds are activated by the orientation of the nitro groups.",2020
Desensitization of the dinitromethyl group: molecular/crystalline factors that affect the sensitivities of energetic materials,"The dinitromethyl group has attracted considerable attention because of its high nitrogen and oxygen content, positive oxygen balance and high energy. Although most dinitromethyl-functionalized compounds suffer from sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, a series of 3-dinitromethanide-1,2,4-triazolone-based energetic salts have now been synthesized and fully characterized. Of these, the ammonium salt is insensitive to impact and friction. X-ray single crystal analysis shows that the ammonium moiety arranges through a close layer-by-layer assembly, which is helpful in decreasing sensitivity. In addition, intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, and intense - interactions also are stabilizing factors which impact the sensitivity of the ammonium salt. The enthalpies of formation and energetic properties of the series of salts were determined in order to reach the conclusion that these multiple stabilization factors are effective tools in decreasing the sensitivity of dinitromethyl-based energetic materials.",2018
3D-Cube Layer Stacking: A Promising Strategy for High-Performance Insensitive Energetic Materials,"It is desirable to consider the molecular design and crystal configuration in the research of energetic materials. We discovered an interesting layer stacking crystal configuration, which is different from previous 2D-plane layer stacking, and termed it as ""3D-cube layer stacking"". This new configuration, resulting from the unusual U-shaped molecular structures and vast H-bonding interactions, breaks through the limitations of the planar molecular structures in 2D-plane layer stacking. Compound 4, which features such characteristics, exhibits excellent energetic performance (D: 9043 m s(-1);p: 35.6 GPa) and acceptable sensitivities (IS: 16 J; FS: 180 N). These positive results, indicate that 3D-cube layer stacking may open new avenues for the design of energetic materials.",2017
Calculations of bond dissociation energies and dipole moments in energetic materials using density-functional methods,"We compare the effectiveness of six exchange/correlation functional combinations (Becke/Lee, Yang and Parr; Becke-3/Lee, Yang and Parr; Becke/Perdew-Wang 91; Becke-3/Perdew-Wang 91; Becke/Perdew 86; Becke-3/Perdew 86) for computing C-N, O-O and N-NO2 dissociation energies and dipole moments of five compounds. The studied compounds are hexabydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), dimethylnitramine, cyanogen, nitromethane and ozone. The Becke-3/Perdew 86 in conjunction with 6-31G** is found to give the best results, although for the dipole moments of RDX, there is a slightly difference that B3P86/6-31G** is less reliable than B3P86/6-31+G**.

The continuous chemical reaction threshold bond for determining the triggering of energetic materials under pressure,"This article tries to find a method to judge the trigger bond from the sensitivity of energy materials (EMs). The results show that the bandgap judgment cannot be used to determine the trigger bond. At the same time, we find that the rate and magnitude of energy changes can be used to identify the trigger bond of EMs. Finally, we discuss the so-called trigger bond. It is not necessarily the first break, but it is the most critical key to cause the initiation of EMs. We name it as the continuous chemical reaction threshold bond.",2023
Tubular flame synthesis of alumina particles: Effect of the addition of energetic materials to precursors,"Fine particle synthesis using tubular flame combustion allows efficient use of combustion energy and highly accurate control of particle morphology and composition by temperature and gas concentration. In this study, we investigated the addition of energetic materials to precursors to improve the heating efficiency and increase the specific surface area of alumina particles in tubular flames. The addition of ammonium nitrate (AN) to the precursor resulted in irregular particles with flake-like or concave surfaces. The particles were deformed by the large amount of gas generated by the decomposition and combustion of AN in the flame field. Furthermore, the addition of urea to the precursor increased heat generation and the percentage of the high-temperature alpha-alumina phase. The gas adsorption results showed that the specific surface area of fine alumina particles prepared with the addition of energetic materials increased up to 2.6 times compared to that obtained without energetic materials (118 m2,g-1).",2023

All these new compounds were characterized by (H-1, C-13)NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Non-ideal behaviour of ammonium nitrate based high-energetic materials in small diameter steel tube,"The size effect curve for non-ideal behavior is the relationship between the detonation velocity and the inverse radius of the cylindrical charge. In this paper we discuss the size effect curves obtained by a steel tube test for an ammonium nitrate (AN)-based explosive. The results for AN and mixtures of AN and activated carbon (AC) are examined. The composition of AN/AC and the charge diameter are varied from 0.1 to 20 wt% and from 5.7 to 65.9 mm, respectively, and their effect on the detonation velocity is investigated using curved-front theory. The size effect curve for pure AN has a point of inflection, and the curve can be expressed as two straight lines. Finally, the size effect curves for AN/AC mixtures are constructed and formulated for almost the entire experimental region.",2013
Probing soft materials with energetic ions and molecules: from microscopic models to the real world,"After introducing a typical example of the performance of C-60 clusters for the molecular depth-profiling analysis of (bio-)organic samples by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), this contribution reviews a few areas in which microscopic models using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a better understanding and predictions in the field of organic sample sputtering.

"Chemical bonding and intermolecular interactions in energetic materials: 1,3,4-trinitro-7,8-diazapentalene","The electron density and related properties of the red-colored energetic material 1,3,4-trinitro-7,8-diazapentalene ( space group Pca2(1)) have been determined from a low-temperature [90.0 (1) K] X-ray diffraction experiment. Intensity data were measured with a 2 K CCD Bruker diffractometer using Ag K alpha radiation. One detector setting, several phi settings, 0.15 degrees w scans and 96 s exposure time per frame gave R-int = 0.0188 for 31 952 (10 283 unique) reflections and (sin theta/lambda)(max) = 1.15 angstrom(-1). The electron density was modeled using the Hansen-Coppens [(1978), Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921] multipole model and refined to R = 0.026 for 9455 unique observed reflections. The electron density, Laplacian and electrostatic potential distributions are reported and discussed. The properties of the bond (3, -1) critical points are analyzed. All results are indicative of multiple bonds in the five-membered rings. In addition, a significant number of weak intermolecular interactions (O...H, O...O, O...N, O...C) have also been characterized by the properties of their critical points.

"High-Pressure Studies of Hydrogen-Bonded Energetic Material 3,6-Dihydrazino-","Hydrogen bonding is an important non-covalent interaction that plays a key role in most of the CHNO-based energetic materials, which has a great impact on the structural, stability, and vibrational properties. By analyzing the structural changes, IR spectra, and the Hirshfeld surfaces, we investigated the high-pressure behavior of 3,6-dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT) to provide detailed description of hydrogen bonding interactions using dispersion-corrected density functional theory. The strengthening of hydrogen bonding is observed by the pressure-induced weakening of covalent N-H bonds, which is consistent with the red shift of NH/NH2 stretching vibrational modes. The intermolecular interactions in DHT crystals lead to more compact and stable structures that can increase the density but diminish the heat of detonation, Q. The calculated detonation properties of DHT (D = 7.62 km/s, P = 25.19 GPa) are slightly smaller than those of a similar explosive 3,6-bis-nitroguanyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (D = 7.9 km/s, P = 27.36 GPa). Overall, the crystallographic and spectroscopic results along with Hirshfeld surface analysis as a function of pressure reveal the presence of strong hydrogen bonding networks in the crystal structure of DHT.",2018
"Computational Studies on Nitro, Nitramino, and Dinitramino Derivatives of 1-Aminoazadiboridine as High Energetic Material","Computational studies were performed to determine the thermodynamic and explosive characteristics of high energy materials formed by placing explosophores such as nitro (-NO2), nitramino (-NHNO2), and dinitramino (-N(NO2)(2)) groups on 1-aminoazadiboridine. G3 level calculations were made to determine the gas phase heat of formation of the designed species. In addition to the above, condensed phase heat of formation was also determined by evaluating the sublimation enthalpy. Crystal densities of title compounds were predicted with the help of a wave function analysis (WFA) program and were found to be in the range of 1.55-1.83gcm(-3). Bond dissociation energies of various possible bond rupture routes of the designed molecules were calculated at DFT-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level and attempt was made to identify the trigger linkage. Impact sensitivity was evaluated theoretically by employing a method based on statistical parameters determined from electrostatic potential data. Results show that the designed molecules are highly energetic and their corresponding detonation properties place them in the category of safe and high performance explosive materials.",2016
"An investigation into 'green' energetic materials, by the synthesis of novel main group coordination compounds","This thesis describes an investigation into the coordination chemistry of main group elements. The synthesis, properties and reactivity of several novel complexes are discussed. The complexes are of silicon, germanium and phosphorus. They are either neutral/Lewis base adducts or isolated as salts. The syntheses of starting materials and the novel compounds are described. Various spectroscopic techniques are used to characterize the compounds including infrared and Raman spectroscopy and 1 H, 13 C, 14 N, 29 Si and 73 Ge NMR spectroscopy. These techniques are also used to study the dissociation behaviour of the complexes in solution. The structures of selected compounds are determined using X-ray crystallography.

The results obtained by this study are compared and contrasted to similar existing compounds in the literature.",2014
"Computational studies on nitramino derivatives of 1-amino-1,2-azaboriridine as high energetic material","In this study, we have applied computational methods to determine the thermodynamic and explosive characteristics of nitramino derivatives of 1-amino-1,2-azaboriridine. Mono-, di- and tri-nitramino derivatives have been designed and considered for detailed study. Structure optimization and frequency calculation of the species have been performed at DFT-B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The atomization method is employed to calculate the heat of formation (HOF), using electronic energy data calculated at G3 level. Utilizing the WFA program, crystal densities of designed compounds considered during the present study were predicted using the data obtained at B3PW91/6-31G(d, p) level. Results show that the number of nitramino groups influences the heat of formation of the title compounds. The calculated bond dissociation energies suggest that the N-NO2 bond of the nitramino group is the weakest bond and may be treated as a trigger bond involved in the detonation process. The impact sensitivities (h(50)) of all the compounds were evaluated and it was found that the designed compound 1-amino-2,3,3-trinitramino-1,2-azaboriridine is highly insensitive towards impact. Theoretical estimate of the condensed phase density of nitramino derivatives was found to be in the range of 1.60-1.80 g cm(-3). Detonation velocity (D) and the detonation pressure (P) were found to be 8.0-9.0 km s(-1) and 26.2-35.2 GPa, respectively. The present investigation reveals that one of the designed compounds 1-amino-2,3,3-trinitramino-1,2-azaboriridine meets the criteria for high energy density materials.",2014
Tuning the synthesis of a dinitroaromatic towards a new trinitroaromatic stabilized energetic material,"A new isomer of diaminotrinitrobenzene, 3, has been prepared from 1,2-diaminobenzene under high dilution conditions in which the two NH(2) electron-donating groups increase the thermal stability of the 1,2,3-trinitrobenzene backbone. Its thermal decomposition only begins around 230 degreesC and deflagration occurs at 298 degreesC, which is of interest for heat-resistant explosives. The crystal structure of the known 1,2-diamino-4,5-dinitrobenzene, 4, which has been obtained in place of 3 under different dilution conditions, is also reported and reveals interesting van der Waals and intermolecular N-H...O-N hydrogen-bonding interactions.",2005
Effect of the Temperature on the Magnetic and Energetic Properties of Soft Magnetic Composite Materials,"In recent years, innovative magnetic materials have been introduced in the field of electrical machines. In the ambit of soft magnetic materials, laminated steels guarantee good robustness and high magnetic performance but, in some high-frequency applications, can be replaced by Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) materials. SMC materials allow us to reduce the eddy currents and to design innovative 3D magnetic circuits. In general, SMCs are characterized at room temperature, but as electrical machines operate at high temperature (around 100 degrees C), an investigation analysis of the temperature effect has been carried out on these materials; in particular, three SMC samples with different binder percentages and process parameters have been considered for magnetic and energetic characterization.",2021
Sensitivity of energetic materials: Evidence of thermodynamic factor on a large array of CHNOFCl compounds,"Mechanical and thermal hazards are critical for chemical compounds. Foremost, the design of novel energetic materials that are stable, insensitive, but have a detonation performance superior to in-service materials is of great interest. However, a single source of safety data for hazardous materials with explosophoric functionalities is still missing. Herein, an experimental database on thermal stability, impact, and friction sensitivity for 150 CHNOFCl compounds is presented. Mechanical sensitivity is discussed in detail: particle size and shape effects, instrument design, and experimental protocol are considered. The entire dataset was analyzed using the simple descriptors of molecular structure. Mechanical sensitivity was found to be linearly correlated with the maximal heat of explosion for certain classes of compounds (nitrobenzenes, furazans, pyrazoles, etc.). Consideration of all species shows that previously proposed sensitivity increase with an energy content rise is relevant, although it is not strict line, as was assumed, but rather a widened ""strip"". A new parameter, safety factor, is proposed to combine two types of sensitivity data. With this factor, the limiting values of mechanical sensitivity at a given energy content are provided that represent the state-of-art development of energetic materials and may be used for screening and design of novel compounds.",2021
"Polymorphic Transition in Traditional Energetic Materials: Influencing Factors and Effects on Structure, Property, and Performance","Polymorphism is universal in energetic materials, and polymorphic transformation (PT) causes variations in the structure, properties, and performance. This article reviews the polymorphs of six traditional energetic compounds (ECs), including 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), and 2,2-dinitroethylene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7), and the PT-induced variations of molecular and packing structures and energies, crystal morphology, sensitivity and detonation performance, and defects, as well as factors influencing the PT and strategies for controlling PT. In all of the polymorphs determined experimentally, there is a small difference in molecular volume, whereas a large difference can appear in molecular conformation, intermolecular distance, packing pattern, crystal density, sensitivity, and detonation performance. Moreover, in addition to temperature and pressure, crystal quality and additive can seriously affect the PT. In addition, recrystallization, coatings, and addition of additives are available to control the PT. Finally, some issues are raised, such as the determination of new polymorphs at high temperature and high pressure, clarifying the PT boundary and mechanism, considering polymorphs at extremes in understanding an EC, and paying attention to the PT of newly thriving energetic cocrystals and energetic ionic salts.",2020
Thermal expansion of energetic material TEX obtained from x-ray diffraction and first principles calculations,"X-ray powder diffraction studies on the secondary explosive TEX (C6H6N4O8) in the temperature range 25-150 degrees C are reported. TEX has a triclinic structure (a = 6.850 angstrom, b = 7.665 angstrom, c = 8.826 angstrom, alpha = 82.38 degrees, beta= 75.0 degrees, and gamma = 79.30 degrees at 25 degrees C), space group P (1) over bar. The crystal structure remains triclinic in this temperature range. From the temperature dependence of lattice parameters we find that thermal expansion is different along different directions. The volume thermal expansion coefficient 17.4 x 10(-5) K--(1) is comparable to that of a related material, CL-20. Thermal expansion along the c-direction alpha(c) is 2.2 times alpha(s) and 3 times alpha(b). Phonon frequencies of TEX crystal at different pressures are obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations using CASTEP codes. The volume thermal expansion coefficient calculated using Gruneisen formalism is 6.1 x 10(-5) K--(1). This is the first report on the experimental determination of thermal expansion of TEX, and computation by Gruneisen formalism using DFT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019
Cooperative enhancement of the nonlinear optical response in conjugated energetic materials: A TD-DFT study,"Conjugated energetic molecules (CEMs) are a class of explosives with high nitrogen content that posses both enhanced safety and energetic performance properties and are ideal for direct optical initiation. As isolated molecules, they absorb within the range of conventional lasers. Crystalline CEMs are used in practice, however, and their properties can differ due to intermolecular interaction. Herein, time-dependent density functional theory was used to investigate one-photon absorption (OPA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) of monomers and dimers obtained from experimentally determined crystal structures of CEMs. OPA scales linearly with the number of chromophore units, while TPA scales nonlinearly, where a more than 3-fold enhancement in peak intensity, per chromophore unit, is calculated. Cooperative enhancement depends on electronic delocalization spanning both chromophore units. An increase in sensitivity to nonlinear laser initiation makes these materials suitable for practical use. This is the first study predicting a cooperative enhancement of the nonlinear optical response in energetic materials composed of relatively small molecules. The proposed model quantum chemistry is validated by comparison to crystal structure geometries and the optical absorption of these materials dissolved in solution. Published by AIP Publishing.",2017
"Approaches to 1,4-Disubstituted Cubane Derivatives as Energetic Materials: Design, Theoretical Studies and Synthesis","Novel 1,4-disubstituted cubane derivatives have been designed and selected ones have been successfully synthesized and characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques, including single-crystal X-ray analysis. A detailed computational study at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory revealed that all newly designed 1,4-disubstituted cubane derivatives possess higher densities, higher density-specific impulse and superior ballistic properties when compared to conventional fuels, for example, RP-1. These compounds also exhibit acceptable kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities which were evaluated in terms of their HOMO-LUMO energy gap and bond dissociation energies, respectively, and are superior to TEX and many other compounds containing explosophoric groups. These results provide novel insights into the possible application of cubane-based energetic materials.",2022

THREE-DIMENSIONAL 'TEXTURED' COATINGS AS FIRST-WALL MATERIALS: EXPOSURE TO ENERGETIC IONS ON RHEPP-1,"The level of energy deposition on future inertial fusion energy (IFE) reactor first walls, particularly in direct-drive scenarios, makes the ultimate survivability of such wall materials a challenge. We investigate the survivability of three-dimensional (3-D) dendritic materials fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and exposed to repeated intense helium beam pulses on the RHEPP-1 facility at Sandia National Laboratories. Prior exposures of flat materials have led to what appears to be unacceptable mass loss on timescales insufficient for economical reactor operation. Two potential advantages of such dendritic materials are a) increased effective surface area, resulting in lowered fluences to most of the wall material surface, and b) improvement in materials properties for such micro-engineered metals compared to bulk processing. Several dendritic fabrications made with either tungsten and tungsten with rhenium show little or no morphology change after up to 800 pulses of 1 MeV helium at reactor-level thermal wall loading. Since the rhenium is added in a thin surface layer, its use does not appear to raise environmental concerns for fusion designs.",2011
Initial response and combustion behavior of microscale Al/PTFE energetic material by nanosecond laser ignition,"Al/PTFE reactive material has potential applications in defense and military due to its good thermody-namic properties and strong stability. To clarify its microscopic reaction process, the initial response and combustion behavior from microsecond up to several milliseconds are fully exhibited via laser-induced plasma spectroscopy and high-speed schlieren photographs while varying the ignition energy. Totally dif-ferent plasma chemistry and combustion behavior of microscale Al/PTFE (mole ratio of 4:3) from those of pure Al are recorded. The fading of AlO and CN emissions and enhancement of C 2 emission from the composite plasma with increase of laser energy prove that Al-F exothermic combination dominate the initial response since the decomposed gases of PTFE keep most Al away from air to be oxidized. The ac-celeration of laser-induced shockwave by a local high temperature reaction zone at the expanding plume front along the direction of laser beam is illustrated. As the plasma quenched and transformed to com-bustion at later stage, an ellipsoidal flame generally occurs above the surface for PTFE composite due to the upward move of Al vapor with PTFE decomposition gas while the combustion from pure Al exhibits a horizontal expansion along the surface. Self-sustained combustion of micro-Al/PTFE lasts around 1 ms is observed at extreme high energy of 1100 mJ. Inside flame plume, the transmission of decomposition matter and energy between different flame parts are clarified. Finally, a qualitative reaction model is built to successfully describe the response and combustion behavior after nanosecond laser ignition in detail. This study provides the support for the application of these insensitive reactive materials in laser ignition. (c) 2023 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2023
"Compatibility Study of 1,1-Diamino-2,2-Dinitroethene (FOX-7) with Some Energetic Materials","1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) is a novel explosive with low sensitivity and high performance. The compatibility of FOX-7 with nine common energetic materials including hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 3,4-dinitrofurazanfuroxan (DNTF), 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), hexanitrostilbene (HNS-II), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TATB), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the vacuum stability test (VST) as the thermal technique and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) as a nonthermal technique. DSC measurements showed that the binary systems of FOX-7/CL-20, FOX-7/HMX, FOX-7/NTO, and FOX-7/TNT were compatible in grade of A, the systems of FOX-7 with heat-resistant explosives including HNS-II, LLM-105, and TATB were compatible as well in grade of A-B, and the binary systems of FOX-7/DNTF and FOX-7/RDX had poor compatibility. VST results indicated that FOX-7 was compatible with nine energetic materials. Besides, the compatibility results of the thermal analysis were confirmed by the XRD technique.",2020
Controlling of flame propagation in a composite solid energetic material: From stabilization to chaotic regimes,"The flame propagation in a solid composite energetic sample comprised of a solid energetic annulus surrounding a highly conductive core is investigated using one-step Arrhenius reaction mechanism. The steady-state solutions, its linear stability analysis and the results of direct numerical simulations of non-stationary problem are presented. It was found that the flame dynamics is highly subject to variation in the presence of the conductive core leading in some cases to a chaotic flame behavior or to stabilization of the flame propagation. It was demonstrated that for given combustion properties of the energetic material the kind of flame dynamics observed in the composite sample can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the experimental parameters such as the thickness of the fuel annulus deposited or the diameter of the heat conductive core.

Energetic Materials Trends in 5-and 6-Membered Cyclic Peroxides Containing Hydroperoxy and Hydroxy Substituents,"Ten peroxide compounds based upon the 3,6-di(hydroperoxy)-1,2-dioxane, 2-hydroxy-6-hydroperoxy-1,2-dioxane, 3,5-di(hydroperoxy)-1,2-dioxolane, and 3-hydroxy-5-hydroperoxy-1,2-dioxolane skeletons have been synthesized, structurally characterized, and fully evaluated for their energetic materials properties. The solid-state structures of these compounds are dominated by hydrogen bonding interactions involving the hydroperoxy and hydroxy groups. Energetic materials testing shows that most of the compounds are highly sensitive toward impact and friction, with similar properties to highly sensitive peroxides such as triacetone triperoxide. 3,5-Diethyl-5-hydroperoxy-1,2-dioxolan-3-ol (3b) and 3,5-dimethyl-5-hydroperoxy1,2-dioxolan-3-ol (5b) have lower impact and friction sensitivities than the other compounds, with values that are appropriate for use as primary explosives.",2016

Effects of microstructure on mechanical and energy release properties of Ni-Al energetic structural materials,"Ni-Al energetic structural materials (ESMs) has been widely applied in defense field, because of its good mechanical and energy release properties. The effects of the microstructure on mechanical and energy release properties of ESMs are not well understood. In this study, by designing the particle size Ni:Al = 1 mu m:25 mu m and Ni:Al = 20 mu m:25 mu m, two kinds of samples, Ni continuous phase (Ni-cp) and Al continuous phase (Al-cp), were prepared by explosive consolidation. The microstructure characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscope. Quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were also conducted to analyze the mechanical properties. It showed that the Ni-cp ESMs had higher quasi-static compressive strength of 325 MPa and fracture strain of 21.3%, compared with the Al-cp ESMs having the strength 275 MPa and the fracture strain 17.5%. Also, the dynamic compressive strength of the Ni-cp ESMs sample is higher than that of the Al-cp ESMs sample. The reaction characteristics of the two ESMs in different atmospheres were discussed by differential scanning calorimetry. The result showed that the reaction temperature of the Ni-cp ESMs was lower. Impact-induced energy release tests on the two ESMs were performed to understand their energy release properties. The results showed that the microstructure had significant effects on the ignition velocity threshold and reaction efficiency. The Ni-cp ESMs has better reaction performance because of the high interface density.",2022
Impact Induced Microstructural and Crystal Anisotropy Effects on the Performance of HMX Based Energetic Materials,"Accurate predictions of the behavior of energetic materials necessitates incorporation of all possible variables affecting the mechanical behavior of such materials into numerical models. This work presents findings in the combined experimental and computational study of the effects of anisotropy and microstructure on the behavior of HMX-based energetic materials. Large single crystal samples of β-HMX were meticulously created by solvent evaporation for experimental purposes, and respective orientations were identified via x-ray diffraction. Indentation modulus and hardness values were obtained for different orientations of β-HMX via nanoindentation experiments. Small-scale dynamic impact experiments were performed, and a viscoplastic power law model fit, to describe the anisotropic viscoplastic properties of the crystal. The anisotropic fracture toughness and surface energy of β-HMX were calculated by studying indentationnucleated crack system formations and fitting the corresponding data to two different models, developed by Lawn and Laugier. It was found that the {011} and {110} planes had the highest and lowest fracture toughnesses, respectively. Drop hammer impact tests were performed to investigate effects of morphology on the impact-induced thermal response of HMX. Finally, the anisotropic properties obtained in this work were applied in a cohesive finite element simulation involving the impact of a sample of PBX containing HMX crystals with varying orientations. This showed temperature spikes to occur where the crystals are in closer proximity. Cohesive finite element models were generated of separate microstructure containing anisotropic or isotropic properties of HMX particle. In comparison, the isotropic model had more even distributions of stress through the material as expected, however, the anisotropic model withstood larger amounts or stress for longer than the isotropic model.",2021
Comparison of Likelihood of Hotspot Formation in Energetic Materials Due to Spherical and Planar Impact,"Energetic materials are widely used as rocket propellants and explosives in the field of aerospace and defense. Understanding the nature of impact in polymer-bonded explosives is crucial safety and transportation of energetic materials. The formation of hotpots in energetic materials leads to unexpected initiations, posing a safety hazard. An attempt was made to study the mechanical behavior of energetic materials under different shapes of impactors. In particular, the likelihood of hotspot formations was discussed in spherical and Spherical Impactors (SI). Spherical and planarshaped impactors were modeled with a cohesive finite element framework to simulate the behavior of granular energetic materials with cyclo-tetramethylene-tetranitramine(HMX) embedded in a hydroxyl-polybutadiene binder. Temperature distribution and stresses induced around crystals on expanding stress profile of SI and uniform pressure profile from a SI are compared to determine the possibility of detonation. In this work, the dependence of sample morphology on induced stresses in the microstructure is highlighted by using three different microstructures. A digitized polymer-bonded-explosive microstructure was analyzed for possible initiations with different impact velocities. The effect of the shape of grains and volume fractions on the likeliness of hotspot formation were studied using rounded and sharp-edged idealized crystals. Impactor behavior on samples was compared based on force chains, temperature profiles, and stress distributions.",2021
Combustion performance of nano Si powder with molecular perovskite energetic materials DAP-4 as oxidant,"Nano Silicon (Si) powder has become a new type of solid fuel in recent years because of its high energy density, large gas production, and low agglomeration behavior. Optimizing and improving its energy release performance is an important challenge. In this paper, DAP-4, an energetic molecular perovskite material with high energy and strong oxidation, was introduced as the oxidant to prepare DAP-4/Si composites, and its combustion properties were studied. The thermal decomposition, combustion performance, as well as their combustion product properties, were studied. The results showed the thermal decomposition properties of DAP-4/Si composites still keep stable (>370 degrees C), and the combustion properties of DAP-4/Si composites first increase with Si content and then reduced. It was confirmed that DAP-4/Si with the ratio of 6.5:3.5-6:4 had a better burning intensity than the other ratios. The combustion mechanism of DAP-4/Si composites was proposed based on the ignition and combustion characteristics of DAP-4/Si composites. This work may provide a further reference for the application of DAP-4 into solid propellant formulation.",2023
Toward Advanced High-Performance Insensitive FOX-7-like Energetic Materials via Positional Isomerization,"For an energetic molecule with a definite elemental composition, the substituent type and position are the most important factors to influence its detonation performance and mechanical sensitivities. In this work, two pairs of FOX-7-like energetic isomers based on (2 and HTz-FOX; 5 and 6) were synthesized and characterized. Through positional isomerization, advanced high-performance insensitive explosives were obtained. Compounds 2 and 5 with an amino group adjacent to the electron-withdrawing side of the ethene bridge show both higher thermal stability and lower mechanical sensitivities (2: Td = 258 degrees C, impact sensitivity (IS) = 25 J, and friction sensitivity (FS) = 300 N; 5: Td = 264 degrees C, IS = 30 J, and FS = 320 N). In addition, 2 shows ultrahigh detonation performance (Dv = 9224 m s-1 and P = 31.1 GPa). These promising physicochemical properties are comparable to those of HMX (Dv = 9193 m s-1, P = 37.8 GPa, Td = 275 degrees C, IS = 7.4 J, and FS = 120 N), which suggests that 2 may be a promising energetic material in future applications.",2022
Effect of nanostructures on the exothermic reaction and ignition of Al/CuOx based energetic materials,"Al/CuOx based micro- and nanoenergetic materials (EMs) have been made by the thermal oxidation of Cu thin films deposited onto silicon substrates followed by Al integration through thermal evaporation. The micro- and nano-EMs are then characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. By comparing the thermite reactions and ignition properties of Al with micro-CuOx and Al with nano-CuOx, we show experimentally that one-dimensional nanostructures (CuO nanowires) and nano-Al affect greatly the exothermic behaviors and ignition properties of the Al/CuOx based EMs. The higher surface energy associated with the CuO nanowires and the deposited nano-Al is believed to be a possible factor contributing to the enhanced exothermic reactions that occur below the melting point of Al and the smaller ignition delay and lower ignition energy.",2012

Impact of Positional Isomerism on Melting Point and Stability in New Energetic Melt-Castable Materials,"For an energetic material with a definite composi-tion, the substituent position is the most crucial factor to influence its physicochemical properties. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact of positional isomerism on multidimensional properties differences. Herein, we reported two new potential energetic melt-castable molecules, a pair of positional isomers (4-MMDNP and 5-MMDNP). These two explosives exhibit obviously different properties, including densities ( Delta rho = 0.03 g cm-3), melting point (Delta Tm = 47.2 degrees C), decomposition temperature (Delta Td = 27.3 degrees C), stability (IS = 20 J, FS = 160 N vs IS = 10 J, FS = 40 N), etc., even though they share similar compositions and structures. Simultaneously, by analyzing crystal packing, intermolecular interactions, and monomolecular parameters, we were able to uncover the roots of property differences. Altogether, our results provide comprehensive molecular and crystal level insight into the effect of positional isomerism, which may be useful for new molecular design.",2023
A room-temperature moisture-stabilized metal-free energetic ferroelectric material for piezoelectric generation,"Metal-free molecule-based ferroelectrics that are degradable and exhibit tunable structures, low production costs, and ""soft"" textures have prospects for sensing and piezoelectric generation applications, but the instances integrating multiple functionalities are very rare. Herein, we proved that an energetic material based on ternary perchlorate salt, (1-methyl-1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium)(NH4)(ClO4)(3) (DAP-M4), is simultaneously a rare room-temperature ferroelectric crystal with a low hygroscopicity (a weight increase of less than 0.02% under 100% relative humility), an ultrawide band gap of 5.4 eV, ""soft"" mechanical properties (Young's modulus less than 23.68 GPa), and an exploitable piezoelectricity (d(34) = 5.24 pC N-1). Moreover, its potential piezoelectric generation application was demonstrated by an easily fabricated DAP-M4/TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) composite film with an open-circuit voltage of 3.5 V and a short-circuit current of 0.5 mu A. Being a novel energetic ferroelectric material with simultaneously excellent energetic and optical-electrical properties, DAP-M4 provides an attractive possibility for assembling highly integrated functional and self-destructive devices, and inspires the design of next-generation multi-functional materials based on diverse molecular components.",2023
Paradox of small particles in the pulsed laser initiation of explosive decomposition of energetic materials,"The dependences of the critical energy density required to initiate the explosive decomposition of lead azide and the radius of the most heated nanoparticle on the pulse duration of the first harmonic of neodymium laser (1064 nm) are calculated within the framework of the micro-hotspot model of thermal explosion. The calculations are carried out with account for the dependence of the absorption efficiency factor of the laser pulse on the lead nanoparticle radius. With the maximum value of the absorption efficiency factor (1.18), the lead nanoparticle radius (in lead azide) becomes 74 nm. If the pulse duration is short (smaller than 40 ns), the radius of the most heated lead nanoparticle in the lead azide matrix varies slightly (less than 15%) and equals 63.5 nm within the range of short pulse durations. Accounting for the dependence of the absorption efficiency factor of the laser pulse on the nanoparticle radius makes it possible to resolve the paradox of small particles.",2016

The structural analysis revealed the existence of unusual multiwalled tubular channels and interweaving of single and double helical units in 1. The standard molar enthalpy of formation was found to be 1788.73 kJmol(-1), which is the highest value among previously reported MOF-based energetic materials. The calculated detonation properties showed that 1 can be used as a potential explosive.

The dihydrazinium salt of [N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-) 1, its dihydrate 2, and its dihydrazinate 3 were prepared in high yield. Synthesis in water afforded yellow needles of [N(2)H(5)](2)(+)[N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-).2H(2)O (2): monoclinic, P2/c, a = 8.958(2) A, b = 3.6596(7) A, c = 16.200(3) A, beta = 96.834(3) degrees, V = 527.3(2) A(3), Z = 2; synthesis in anhydrous hydrazine gave yellow [N(2)H(5)](2)(+)[N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-).2N(2)H(4) (3): triclinic, P1, a = 4.6208(6) A, b = 8.585(1) A, c = 9.271(1) A, alpha = 108.486(2) degrees, beta = 95.290(2) degrees, gamma = 102.991(2) degrees, V = 334.51(8) A(3), Z = 1. The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and vibrational (IR, Raman) and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy ((1)H, (13)C, (14)N, (15)N). The new compounds represent new high-nitrogen HEDMs with one of the highest nitrogen contents reported to date ([N(2)H(5)](+)(2)[N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-) 85.2%; [N(2)H(5)](+)(2)[N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-).2H(2)O 73.3%; [N(2)H(5)](+)(2)[N(4)C-N=N-CN(4)](2-).2N(2)H(4) 85.7%). The standard heat of formation of the solvate-free compound 1 was computed at the MP2(FULL)/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory to be DeltaH degrees (f) = 264 kcal mol(-1), which translates to 1147 kcal kg(-1) and is one of the highest ever reported. The compounds are stable at room temperature, almost insensitive to friction and impact, but detonate violently when the explosion is initiated, e.g., by rapid heating over the decomposition temperature or by using an initiator.",l-02
Shock wave generated by composite energetic material driven by electrical non-penetrating wire explosion plasma,"Underwater shock wave technology can realize dynamic rock fracture, which is helpful to increase oil and gas reservoir permeability. It can realize the efficient exploitation of medium and low maturity oil and gas resources. In practical application, the shock wave parameters require not only high intensity but also safety and controllability. To meet these requirements, insensitive composite energetic materials driven by electrical wire explosion plasma were proposed, which is one of the most promising methods. However, when in use, the load assembly process containing wires and energetic materials is complex. In this paper, a new type of energetic material load is proposed, using non-penetrating wire to drive composite energetic material. It can simplify the production process of the energetic load and produce acceptable shock wave parameters. The test results show that both the energy deposition of the wire and the shock wave intensity decrease under a non-penetrating wire structure. However, the shock wave intensity is still higher than that of the underwater electrical wire explosion. Based on schlieren diagnosis, it is found that the composite energetic material is gradually driven, and the energy release is not concentrated. In addition, the ""non-wire"" structure driving condition was discussed in contrast. Under this condition, the process of ionization channel establishment in composite energetic materials is random. The shock wave intensity is weak because the composite energetic material is in the process of slow detonation.",2024
"Energetic materials with fluorinated four-membered heterocyclic ring: 3,3′-difluoroazetidine (DFAZ) salts","3,3 '-Difluoroazetidinium (DFAZ) possesses a high-tensile four-membered ring and fluorine atoms, which contributes to the specific impulse, detonation pressure and detonation velocity. High-density energetic salts that contain oxygen-rich anions and cations were synthesized. All of the salts were fully characterized by IR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as well as impact and friction sensitivity. Their detonation properties were calculated according to the densities and heats of formation. The results showed that compared to ADN, they all had a relatively high density and low impact sensitivity. The specific impulse of almost all of the salts were higher than that of the propellant component, ammonium dinitramide (ADN, I-sp = 202 J). Moreover, the 3,3 '-difluoroazetidinium nitroformate salt had the highest specific impulse and was relatively more stable. It is possible to obtain energetic cations with good properties by combining four-membered high-tension rings with fluorine atoms.",2019
"Hot spots in energetic materials generated by infrared and ultrasound, detected by thermal imaging microscopy","We have observed and characterized hot spot formation and hot-spot ignition of energetic materials (EM), where hot spots were created by ultrasonic or long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) exposure, and were detected by high-speed thermal microscopy. The microscope had 15-20 mu m spatial resolution and 8.3 ms temporal resolution. LWIR was generated by a CO2 laser (tunable near 10.6 mu m or 28.3 THz) and ultrasound by a 20 kHz acoustic horn. Both methods of energy input created spatially homogeneous energy fields, allowing hot spots to develop spontaneously due to the microstructure of the sample materials. We observed formation of hot spots which grew and caused the EM to ignite. The EM studied here consisted of composite solids with 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine crystals and polymer binders. EM simulants based on sucrose crystals in binders were also examined. The mechanisms of hot spot generation were different with LWIR and ultrasound. With LWIR, hot spots were most efficiently generated within the EM crystals at LWIR wavelengths having longer absorption depths of similar to 25 mu m, suggesting that hot spot generation mechanisms involved localized absorbing defects within the crystals, LWIR focusing in the crystals or LWIR interference in the crystals. With ultrasound, hot spots were primarily generated in regions of the polymer binder immediately adjacent to crystal surfaces, rather than inside the EM crystals. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",2014
4-Aminothiophenol Functionalized Gold Nanoparticle-Based Colorimetric Sensor for the Determination of Nitramine Energetic Materials,"The heterocyclic nitramine compounds, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), are two most important military-purpose high explosives. Differentiation of RDX and HMX with colorimetric methods of determination has not yet been made because of their similar chemical structures. In this study, a sensitive colorimetric method for the determination of RDX and HMX was proposed on the basis of differential kinetics in the hydrolysis of the two compounds (yielding nitrite as a product) followed by their colorimetric determination using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and naphthylethylene diamine (NED) as coupling agent for azo-dye formation, abbreviated as ""4-ATP AuNP+NED"" colorimetric method. After alkaline hydrolysis in a 1 M Na2CO3 + 0.04 M NaOH mixture solution at room temperature, only RDX (but not HMX) was hydrolyzed to give a sufficient colorimetric response in neutralized solution, the molar absorptivity (epsilon) at 565 nm and the limit of detection (LOD) for RDX being (17.6 +/- 1.3) x 10(3) L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.55 mu g mL(-1), respectively. On the other hand, hot water bath (at 60 degrees C) hydrolysis enabled both nitramines, RDX and HMX, to give substantial colorimetric responses; i.e., epsilon and LOD for RDX were (32.8 +/- 0.5) X 10(3) L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.20 mu g mL(-1) and for HMX were (37.1 +/- 2.8) X 10(3) L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.24 mu g mL(-1), respectively. Unlike other AuNP-based nitrite sensors in the literature showing absorbance quenching within a relatively narrow concentration range, the developed sensor operated with an absorbance increase over a wide range of nitrite. Synthetic mixtures of (RDX + HMX) gave additive responses, and the proposed method was statistically validated against HPLC using nitramine mixtures.",2014
Study on the Compatibility of Tetraethylammonium Decahydrodecaborate (BHN) with some Energetic Components and Inert Materials,"The compatibility of tetraethylammonium decahydrodecaborate (BHN) with some energetic components and inert materials of solid propellants was studied by DSC method, where glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylenetetranitroamine (HMX), lead 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-onate (NTO-Pb), hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 3,4-dinitrofurzanfuroxan (DNTF), N-guanylurea-dinitramide (GUDN), aluminum powder (Al, particle size=12.18m) and magnesium powder (Mg, particle size: 4474m) were used as energetic components and polyoxytetramethylene-co-oxyethylene (PET), polyethylene glycol (PEG), addition product of hexamethylene diisocyanate and water (N-100), hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), cupric adipate (AD-Cu), cupric 2,4-dihydroxy-benzoate (-Cu), lead phthalate (phi-Pb), carbon black (C.B.), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), 1,3-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyl urea (C2), di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (DOS) and potassium perchlorate (KP), were used as inert materials. It was concluded that the binary systems of BHN with NTO-Pb, CL-20, aluminum powder, magnesium powder, PET, PEG, N-100, AD-Cu, -Cu, phi-Pb, C.B., Al2O3, C2, DOS, and KP are compatible, and systems of BHN with GAP and HMX are slightly sensitive, and with RDX, DNTF, and GUDN are incompatible. The impact and friction sensitivity data of BHN and BHN in combination with the energetic materials under present study were obtained, and there was no consequential affiliation between sensitivity and compatibility.",2013
Nuclear Quadrupole Interactions in Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance Detection of Energetic and Controlled Materials: Theoretical Study,"There has been a growing interest in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) techniques useful for the detection of explosives and drugs in solid state systems. This paper uses the first-principles one-electron Hartree-Fock theoretical method to study the nuclear quadrupole interaction parameters e (2) qQ and eta for the N-14 nuclei in the explosives RDX and beta-HMX as well as the drugs cocaine and heroin. It has been found in our earlier published investigations reviewed here that there is very good agreement for our calculated e (2) qQ and eta for N-14, for all these four systems, and experiment. We also present our unpublished theoretical results for cocaine with an HCl molecule attached. We successfully explain quantitatively the drastic decrease in e (2) qQ in going to cocaine-HCl from cocaine-free base as well as the observed substantial increase in eta and discuss the implications of these dramatic changes for NQR detection in general.",2012
An investigation on eutectic binary phase diagram of volatilizable energetic materials by high pressure DSC,"The eutectic binary phase diagrams of volatilizable energetic material 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) with 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) and 1-methyl-2,4-dinitroimidazole (MDNI) have been investigated by high pressure differential scanning calorimeter (PDSC), respectively. The liquefying and melting processes of TNAZ/RDX and TNAZ/MDNI volatilizable systems have been studied. On the basis of the data of apparent fusion heat and liquefying temperature, the phase diagrams of apparent fusion heat (H) with composition (X) and liquefying temperature (T) with composition (X) were constructed, respectively. The results showed that the gasification or volatilization of easy volatile energetic materials could be efficiently restrained by high pressure atmosphere, and the perfect and ideal phase diagrams can be constructed. The eutectic temperatures for TNAZ/RDX and TNAZ/MDNI are measured to be 95.5 and 82.3 A degrees C, respectively. The eutectic compositions of mole ratios for the two systems are obtained to be 93.55/6.45 (T-X method), 93.79/6.21 (H-X method) and 62.25/37.75 (T-X method), 63.29/33.71 (H-X method), respectively.",2010
Modern Highly Energetic Materials for the Production of Gun Powders and Rocket Propellants in Poland,"Polish technology for the production of propellants uses methods which have been known for many years. The continuously developing market requires producers to enhance the parameters of their munitions in order to keep up with demands. Therefore, it is necessary to research and constantly implement new types of gun powders and rocket propellants. In the present work, highly energetic compounds were characterized as constituents of current propellants. Their advantages and disadvantages are described. The requirements for new materials, concerning toxicity, environmental impact, and safety are presented. It is shown that by using modern energetic compounds it is possible to obtain low-vulnerability or insensitive ammunitions. Finally, the situation in the Polish market is briefly described.",2022
Structural Rearrangement of Energetic Materials under an External Electric Field: A Case Study of Nitromethane,"As a significant stimulus, the external electric field (EEF) can change the decomposition mechanism and energy release of energetic materials (EMs). Hence, understanding the response of EMs to an EEF is greatly meaningful for their safe usage. Herein, the structural arrangement, a crucial factor in the impact sensitivity and detonation performance of EMs, under the EEF ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 V/angstrom was investigated via molecular dynamics simulation. Nitromethane (NM) was taken as a case study due to the simple structure. The simulation results show that there exists a critical EEF strength between 0.2 and 0.3 V/angstrom, which can induce the transition of NM molecules from relatively disordered distribution to solidlike ordered and compacted arrangement with a large density. In this ordered structure, NM dipoles are aligned in a head-to-tail pattern parallel to the EEF direction because of the favored dipoledipole interactions and weak C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. As the EEF strength is enhanced, the potential energy and cohesive energy density of the NM system gradually decrease and increase, respectively, indicative of high thermodynamics stability of ordered arrangement. The results reported here also shed light on the potential of the EEF to induce the nucleation and crystallization to explore new polymorphs of EMs.",2018
HP-DSC study of energetic materials. Part I. Overview of pressure influence on thermal behavior,"High pressure differential scanning calorimetry (HP-DSC) has been used to study thermal decomposition of energetic materials, i.e., trinitrotoluene, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, and ammonium dinitramide. HP-DSC runs have been performed in the range of 0.1-14 MPa both in inert and oxidative environments to determine the effect of pressure on vaporization/dissociation, melting, and decomposition processes. Results reveal that the melting point linearly increase with pressure with the slope 0.12-0.15 C/MPa. Decomposition pathways and DSC effects are highly affected by pressure, as evaluated by changes in the peak temperature, reaction heat effect, and kinetic parameters. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor values were defined for separated decomposition stages of compounds, and found to vary with pressure. Vaporization/dissociation of starting material along with secondary reactions are proposed to be the main processes affected by pressure. Obtained results reveal that HP-DSC technique is useful in determining kinetic parameters and heat effect under elevated pressures, where energetic materials are usually applied.

Ability of the Fire Propagation Apparatus to characterise the heat release rate of energetic materials,"Energetic materials encompass a wide range of chemical compounds. They react very rapidly releasing large amounts of energy. One of their peculiarities is that they carry an oxidizer and do not require oxygen from the air as their primary reaction partner. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of the ability to estimate the heat release rate of a sample energetic material using two calorimetric methodologies. The methods are based on Oxygen Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Generation principles. Data have been obtained from experiments carried out with the Fire Propagation Apparatus, First. results from smoke powder combustion tests reveal significant discrepancies between the two approaches. Results from a sensitivity analysis realised in a previous work underlined that the most likely parameters to alter the heat release rate estimation are the energy constants and the concentration of oxygen. Correction procedures have been developed; one based on the estimation of the amount of oxygen supplied by the oxidizer, and a second one based on the calculation of new energy constants accounting for the chemical decomposition of the tested materials. Results are presented in this study. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2009
APPLICATION OF VAN DER WAALS DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY TO STUDY PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS,"An empirical correction to account for van der Waals interactions based on the work of Neumann and Perrin [J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 15531 (2005)] was applied to density functional theory calculations of energetic molecular crystals. The calculated equilibrium unit-cell volumes of FOX-7, beta-HMX, solid nitromethane, PETN-I, alpha-RDX, and TATB show a significant improvement in the agreement with experimental results. Hydrostatic-compression simulations of beta-HMX, PETN-I, and alpha-RDX were also performed. The isothermal equations of state calculated from the results show increased agreement with experiment in the pressure intervals studied.",2009
The simulation of the thermal behavior of energetic materials based on DSC and HFC signals,"Two small calibre and four medium calibre types of propellants were investigated non-isothermally (0.25-4K min(-1)) by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the range of RT-260C and isothermally (60-100C) by heat flow calorimetry (HFC). The data obtained from both techniques were used for the calculation and comparison of the kinetic parameters of the decomposition process. The application of HFC allowed to determine the kinetic parameters of the very early stage of the reaction (reaction progress alpha below 0.02) what, in turn, made possible the precise prediction of the reaction progress under temperature mode corresponding to real atmospheric changes according to STANAG 2895. In addition, the kinetic parameters obtained from DSC data enabled determination of self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) and comparison of the predicted ignition temperature during slow cook-off with the experimental results. The study contains also the results of the calculation of the time to maximum rate (TMRad) of the propellants under adiabatic conditions.",2008
Compressive Symbol: A New Way to Evaluate the High-Pressure Behaviors of Energetic Tetrazole Materials,"Energetic materials may transit to different phases or decompose directly under compression. Their reactivity in the explosions can be evaluated by their high-pressure induced behaviors, including polymorphism or phase transition. Here, we applied DFT methods to understand high-pressure behaviors of four typical tetrazole derivate crystals, including 5-aminotetrazole (ATZ), 1,5-aminotetrazole (DAT), 5-hydrazinotetrazole (HTZ), and 5-azidotetrazole (ADT), under the gradually increased pressure from ambient pressure to 200 GPa. In response to the extreme-high pressures, the performances are dominated by compressibility of crystals, reflected by compressive symbols on the basis of the molecular orientation in crystals. The crystal with weak compressibility (large symbol) generally dissociates, triggered (large generally triggered by cleavage of weak bonds. However, the crystal with low compressive symbol is generally corresponding to a pressure-induced structural transformation or phase transition.",2023
Development of energetic material fast cook-off testing for the new NATO standard (AOP-4240),"Fast Cook-off test (FCO), based on STANAG 4240 Ed2 test procedures 1 and 2, is using liquid hydrocarbon fuels (IMF) to simulate the scenario of fire accidents. However, recently due to increasingly concerning environmental protection, economic effectiveness, and technique enhancement, NATO adopted a new standard AOP 4240 instead of STANAG Ed2 in 2018 for international test standards, which adds procedure 3 using a gas-fueled (GF) heating source for simulation of realistic fire scenarios. By comparison of the most recent global measures applied and in compliance with AOP 4240 requirements, this paper proposes the eco-friendly and safe FCO solution combining the modular-designed burner system with fail-safe propane systems to simulate the fire scenario effectively. Additionally, utilizing the cost-effective and flexible devices separately to collect experimental data. This approach can guarantee test validity and provide more benefits than the traditional test method.",2022
"Ammonium perchlorate-based molecular perovskite energetic materials: preparation, characterization, and thermal catalysis performance with MoS","In this study, ammonium perchlorate (AP)-based molecular perovskite structural high-energetic materials (H(2)dabco)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] (DAP) were fabricated and their catalytic performance upon the addition of MoS2 nanosheets was investigated. The DAP samples were succesfully prepared via a self-assembly reaction and their morphology and structure were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thermal decomposition performance of a pure DAP sample and of a mixture of DAP with MoS2 nanosheets were analyzed via differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that DAP has a high thermal stability at its initial decomposition temperature of 319.8?C, and that its apparent decomposition heat measures 4199?J/g. This value is higher than for AP (829.7?J/g). Furthermore, the thermal decomposition peak temperature of DAP upon the addition of 1?wt% and 3?wt% MoS2 nanosheets decreases from 394.4?C to 343.3?C and 328.8?C, respectively. The investigation of the catalysis thermal performance of DAP may foster its practical application in composite propellant.",2020
Bulk Thermoresponsive Polymeric Materials for Insensitive Munitions Applications: Diels-Alder Crosslinked Networks and Energetic Polymers,"Most energetic material formulations require a polymeric binder to encapsulate the crystalline energetic component. While comprising only a small percentage of the total composition, the binder selection has a large influence on the overall performance of the device. With expectations rising for polymer-bonded explosives (PBX), including demands for reduced sensitivity, better performance, and lower environmental impact, increased attention is being directed towards binder development. Two promising solutions, particularly for insensitive munitions (IM) applications, include stimuli-responsive networks and energetic polymers as improvements over conventional static and inert binder systems. In cookoff scenarios, temperature-responsive networks can decrosslink, allowing the fill to drain out of the device prior to catastrophic decomposition. Towards this end, a bismethacryloyl Diels-Alder (DA) crosslinker was prepared and copolymerized with various n -alkyl methacrylate monomers, and the effect of the polymer glass transition temperature ( T g ) on the decrosslinking behavior was evaluated. While high T g films did not fully decrosslink by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), peaks in the tan delta traces corresponding to failure behavior were observed, and the temperatures at which these transitions take place increase as the T g increases. While the reason for the inability of the glassier films to decrosslink remains to be determined, a positive relationship between T g and decrosslinking temperature was established. Many energetic polymers rely on the synthesis and ring-opening polymerization of energetic oxetane and oxirane monomers. This work seeks to provide two alternatives for the preparation of energetic polymers. The first attempts to overcome the limitations of cyanuric triazide (CTA), a sensitive, sublimation-prone primary explosive, by tethering azidated triazine functionalities to a rubbery polymer backbone using a post-polymerization approach. The second employs common commercial polymers for energetic modification. Polymers containing alkene and nitrile groups can be converted to azides and tetrazoles, respectively, using sodium azide. Even relatively inert polymers, such as styrenic block copolymers, can be radically azidated using azidotrimethylsilane and a hypervalent iodine species. These polymers were spectroscopically characterized to confirm successful functionalization, and energetic properties were evaluated by thermal analysis. With reaction optimization and tuning the percent modification, these materials should serve as interesting alternatives to current energetic polymer binder systems.",2019
Efficient Construction of Energetic Materials via Nonmetallic Catalytic Carbon-Carbon Cleavage/Oxime-Release-Coupling Reactions,"The exploitation of C-C activation to facilitate chemical reactions is well-known in organic chemistry. Traditional strategies in homogeneous media rely upon catalyst-activated or metal-mediated C-C bonds leading to the design of new processes for applications in organic chemistry. However, activation of a C-C bond, compared with C-H bond activation, is a more challenging process and an underdeveloped area because thermodynamics does not favor insertion into a C-C bond in solution. Carbon-carbon bond cleavage through loss of an oxime moiety has not been reported. In this paper, a new observation of self-coupling via C-C bond cleavage with concomitant loss of oxime in the absence of metals (either metal-complex mediation or catalysis) results in dihydroxylammonium 5,5-bistetrazole-1,10-diolate (TKX-50) as well as N,N'-([3,3'-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole)]-5,5'-diyl)dinitramine, a potential candidate for a new generation of energetic materials.",2018
The viability and performance characterization of nano scale energetic materials on a semiconductor bridge (SCB),"The move from conventional energetic composites to nano scale energetic mixtures (nano energetics) has shown dramatic improvement in energy release rate and sensitivity to ignition. A possible application of nano energetics is on a semiconductor bridge (SCB). An SCB typically requires a tenth of the energy input as compared to a bridge wire design with the same no-fire and is capable of igniting in tens of microseconds. For very low energy applications, SCBs can be manufactured to extremely small sizes and it is necessary to find materials with particle sizes that are even smaller to function. Reactive particles of comparable size to the bridge can lead to problems with ignition reliability for small bridges. Nano-energetic composites and the use of SCBs have been significantly studied individually, however, the process of combining nano energetics with an SCB has not been investigated extensively and is the focus of this work. Goals of this study are to determine if nano energetics can be used with SCBs to further reduce the minimum energy required and improve reliability. The performance of nano-scale aluminum (nAl) and bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) with nitrocellulose (NC), Fluorel™ FC 2175 (chemically equivalent to Viton ® ) and Glycidyl Azide Polymer (GAP) as binders where quantified initially using the SenTest™ algorithm at three weight fractions (5, 7, and 9%) of binder. The threshold energy was calculated and compared to previous data using conventional materials such as zirconium potassium chlorate (ZPC), mercuric 5-Nitrotetrazol (DXN-1) and titanium sub-hydride potassium per-chlorate (TSPP). It was found that even though there where only slight differences in performance between the binders with nAl/Bi 2 O 3 at any of the three binder weight fractions, the results show that these nano energetic materials require about half of the threshold energy compared to conventional materials using an SCB with an 84×42 μm bridge. Binder limit testing was conducted to find the critical limit of binder when the output of the SCB declines. The binder was evaluated at 13, 17 and 20% and it was found that the limit amount of binder falls between 17 and 20% by weight of material. Scaling of the SCB bridge was evaluated using a 36×15 μm bridge size and tested using 5, 7 and 9% nAl/Bi 2 O 3 FC 2175 slurry, creating a functioning SCB compared to previous no-ignition results using TSPP. It was also postulated that the compaction of a secondary material onto the SCB would alter the SCB output during testing. It was found that increased energy values where required for both the 5 and 7% binder amounts and no change was seen at the 9% level.",2010
Novel Superthermite Nanocomposite Hybrid Material Based on CuO Coated Carbon Nanofibers for Advanced Energetic Systems,The surfaces of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were first pretreated with a catalyst to enable metal deposition and subsequently coated with a nanoscale layer of copper through electroless deposition. The resulting Cu-coated CNF hybrid was annealed at 250 degrees C to obtain CuO-coated CNFs that were ultrasonically suspended with aluminum nanoparticles (100 nm) in isopropyl alcohol to produce nanothermite colloid; where CuO coating can act as an effective oxidizer for Al nanoparticles. The developed nanothermite colloid was integrated and effectively dispersed in molten tri-nitro toluene (TNT). This novel colloid offers an increase in TNT shock wave strength of by 26% using a ballistic mortar test. Moreover it offers an increase total heat release by 75% using DSC. This is the first time ever to report on nanothermite particles supported on CNFs for highly energetic systems.,2019
Computational design of tetrazolone-based high-energy density energetic materials: Property prediction and decomposition mechanism,"The density functional theory methods are used to design a series of new highly energetic tetrazolone-based molecules by the combination of the linked tetrazolone framework and versatile substitutes. The molecular and electronic structures, physicochemical, and energetic properties were analyzed and predicted. The decomposition mechanisms were computationally simulated, and 3 potential decomposition channels were proposed. These newly designed tetrazolone-based compounds show high densities (up to 2.08g/cm(3)) and highly positive heats of formation (407.0-1377.9kJ/mol) due to all right content of nitrogen and oxygen. Most of them exhibit good detonation velocity (8.31-9.62km/s) and detonation pressure (32.40-43.86GPa), and some are comparative to excellent explosive CL-20. Results show that compounds 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, and 24 own superior detonation performance than widely used explosive HMX and may be promising candidates of green high-performance energetic materials.",2018
An evaluation of complementary approaches to elucidate fundamental interfacial phenomena driving adhesion of energetic materials,"Cohesive Hamaker constants of solid materials are measured via optical and dielectric properties (i.e., Lifshitz theory), inverse gas chromatography (IGC), and contact angle measurements. To date, however, a comparison across these measurement techniques for common energetic materials has not been reported. This has been due to the inability of the community to produce samples of energetic materials that are readily compatible with contact angle measurements. Here we overcome this limitation by using physical vapor deposition to produce thin films of five common energetic materials, and the contact angle measurement approach is applied to estimate the cohesive Hamaker constants and surface energy components of the materials. The cohesive Hamaker constants range from 85 zJ to 135 zJ across the different films. When these Hamaker constants are compared to prior work using Lifshitz theory and nonpolar probe IGC, the relative magnitudes can be ordered as follows: contact angle > Lifshitz > IGC. Furthermore, the dispersive surface energy components estimated here are in good agreement with those estimated by IGC. Due to these results, researchers and technologists will now have access to a comprehensive database of adhesion constants which describe the behavior of these energetic materials over a range of settings.

Design and Synthesis of Nitro Cage Heterocycles as Energetic Materials Derived from Pentacycloundecane (PCUD) Systems,"A variety of pentacycloundecane (PCUD) based cage compounds containing nitro groups were synthesized via a simple synthetic method starting with cage diones. Eight PCUDs were used for nitro functionalization. These cage diones were prepared starting with easily accessible starting materials such as 2,3-dimethylhydroquinone, 1,4-dihydroxybenzene, and cyclopentadiene. Here, we have used Diels-Alder (DA) reaction, [2+2] photocycloaddition, and Henry reaction as key steps. Transannular cyclization plays an important role to generate a nitro substituted cage heterocycles via base promoted reaction using nitromethane as a reagent. Some of these oxa-cage structures have been further supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Energetic performance of the title compounds was evaluated using DFT based calculations. These bis(nitromethyl)octahydro-1H-1,3,4,6(epiethane-[1,1,2,2]tetrayl)-pentaleno[1,6-bc]furan analogues (11 b-18 b) owned the densities in the range of 1.37-1.60 g/cm(3). All the studied compounds possess high positive enthalpy of formation (33.68-230.48 kJ/mol, except compound with dimethyl groups (16 b, -11.38 kJ/mol) and very good thermal (T-m=99-147 degrees C) and kinetic stabilities. Ammonium perchlorate based various propulsion formulations suggests that these compounds could be excellent candidates in the solid rocket propulsion.",2023
Formability and micromechanisms of DP600 dual phase steels in electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming,"This paper investigates dual-phase (DP) steel's formability and microscopic deformation mechanism under electric-pulse triggered energetic materials forming (ETEF). It provides experimental evidence and a detailed explanation for understanding the dynamic fracture mechanism and microstructure of ETEF. The present study analyzes the macroscopic fracture mechanism of ETEF specimens. Compared with quasi-static forming, the forming limits of ETEF with different strain paths (uniaxial tension, plane strain and biaxial tension) were significantly improved: the limit major strains were increased by 40.8 %, 78.2 %, and 18.2 %, respectively. Furthermore, SEM/EBSD/TEM observations revealed the relationship between the microstructure, kernel average misorientation (KAM), dislocation density, slip mechanism, and deformation twinning of DP600 steel. It was concluded that ETEF promoted the plastic flow of ferrite and martensite, reducing the void size and delaying the fracture failure of the material. High KAM increased the overall intensity of local grain deformation and reduced the strain gradient from grain interiors to grain boundaries. Under the condition of ETEF, a high fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and refined grain size were obtained, and a high fraction of LAGBs enhanced the formability of DP steel. Additionally, {012}, {013} and {104} preferred planes appeared under ETEF conditions, forming a strong < 011 > preferred orientation and activating the slip mechanism of the < 100 > fiber component. Finally, TEM confirmed that coordinated deformation of the matrix led to improved form-ability of the DP600 material under ETEF conditions, as evidenced by the activation of the multi-slip system and deformation of the martensitic twins.",2022
"Combining 1,2,4-triazole and pyrazole frameworks for new insensitive energetic materials","A new symmetric compound 3,5-bis(3-amine-4H-1,2,4-triazole)-1H-pyrazole and a series of corresponding energetic salts 5-9 were synthesized. All the new compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopy (IR, NMR, and elemental) analyses and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compound 6 was further investigated by X-ray crystal-structure analysis. Various performance tests of all the compounds, such as density, thermal behavior, mechanical sensitivity and detonation property, were tested. All the target compounds showed relatively positive calculated heat of formation (24.9 to 2396.4 kJ mol(-1)), good mechanical sensitivity (IS > 24 J, FS > 280 N) and acceptable detonation property (D > 7400 m s(-1), P > 19.5 GPa). In particular, energetic salt 9 exhibits prominent detonation property (D > 8964 m s(-1), P > 37.1 GPa) and excellent sensitivity (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N), which show its potential application prospects as a new high energy insensitive material.",2021
Fully packaged paper heater systems with remote and selective ignition capabilities for nanoscale energetic materials,"Development of low-voltage driven multifunctional thermal igniters for nanoscale energetic materials (nEMs) is important for extending the application of nEMs to various thermal engineering fields. In this study, highly flexible heater chips capable of generating a sufficient amount of heat to ignite nEMs at a low voltage are demonstrated by incorporating a patterned aluminum-doped paper (AP) with polymeric substrates. A combination of automatic paper cutting and single-step ultraviolet polymer curing techniques helps in the fabrication of various designs of flexible AP heater chips in a simple and low-cost manner. Based on the AP heater chips, three models of flexible thermal igniters are designed to develop new functions such as selective ignition and sequential ignition in a single chip and successfully operated at low voltages. Two types of compact ignition systems are fabricated by fully integrating the arrayed AP igniters, circuit modules, and portable batteries in a three-dimensional printed single package and on a flexible circuit board. The systems are successfully demonstrated to ignite nEMs wirelessly and selectively with a smartphone. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019
"Azo1,3,4-oxadiazole as a Novel Building Block to Design High-Performance Energetic Materials","In this study, the azo1,3,4-oxadiazole energetic fragment was first introduced into the energetic materials using a simple synthetic strategy, yielding two symmetrical covalent compounds 4 and 5. All new compounds (3-5) were well-characterized by IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. As supported by differenctial scanning calorimetry data, compounds 4 and 5 possess excellent decomposition temperatures as high as 248 and 278 degrees C, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, 278 degrees C ranks highest in all 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based energetic compounds. Their energetic performances were evaluated with EXPLO5. Both 4 and 5 show good detonation velocities (D) of 8409 and 8800 m s(-1) and detonation pressures (P) of 29.3 and 35.1 GPa, comparable to RDX (D: 8795 m s(-1), P: 34.9 GPa). Furthermore, on the basis of the single-crystal data, quantum-chemical calculations were employed to better understand their intrinsic structure-property relationship. All these positive results indicate the superior potential of the azo1,3,4-oxadiazole backbone for designing next generation of energetic materials.",2019
Generation of Electrohydraulic Shock Waves by Plasma-Ignited Energetic Materials: I. Fundamental Mechanisms and Processes,"Shock waves in water have many applications, such as lithotripsy, sterilization, weapons, and so on. Underwater electrical wire explosion can be utilized to produce shock waves with fast front and short duration time efficiently. In order to amplify the energy of shock waves, energetic materials (EMs) were considered. In this paper, Al, Cu, Mo, and W wires with EM covers were designed and tested. The results showed that wire explosion ignited the EMs, which in turn affected the process of wire explosion. As a result, the duration time of shock waves was elongated.",2015
Expanding the it -conjugate structures: Synthesis of high-energy and insensitive Tricyclic fused energetic material,"In order to meet the growing demand for different applications, great efforts have been made to develop new energetic materials with high energy and good safety. Fused cyclic energetic material, a special category of pi-conjugate structures containing two or more rings, typically exhibits excellent performance and is currently a key focus of research. In this paper, we have designed and synthesized a new tricyclic, fused energetic material: 5-amino-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-e]tetrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine 1-oxide (3). The reaction mechanism of the one-step reaction, including nucleophilic substitution and cyclization, has been theoretically investigated. Notably, compound 3 has a high density (1.864 g cm(-3)) at room temperature and good detonation properties (D-v: 8391 m s(-1) and P: 28.2 GPa). Compound 3 has a relatively low impact and friction sensitivity (IS > 40 J, FS > 300 N), and acceptable thermal stability (T-d: 175 degrees C), demonstrating the great potential of compound 3 as a high-energy, insensitive tricyclic fused energy-containing material.",2025
The impact of electronic effect on the dissociation mechanism of oxadiazole-based regioisomeric energetic materials,"With the rapid development of synthesis methods for energetic materials, the regioisomerism effect is gaining increasing attention in the design of multifunctional energetic compounds and in the in-depth study of the relationship between structure and performance. Understanding regioisomerism in energetic materials and its impact on material performance can provide a theoretical basis for material improvement and design. In this paper, the influence of regioisomerism on the thermal stability of oxadiazole-based energetic materials 5,5 ' -bis (trinitromethyl)-3,3 ' -bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole) (BTBO) and trinitromethyl substituted beta -bis(1,2,4-oxadiazole) (TSBO), which have a significant difference in the dissociation temperature, has been thoroughly investigated. The initial decomposition mechanism of the regioisomers is fully discussed, proving that the NO 2 -dissociation path is the main decomposition pathway, revealing that the difference in the energies of the main dissociative bonds of BTBO and TSBO is the direct cause of the different thermal stabilities. The regioisomerism on the thermal stability of BTBO and TSBO is investigated: the electronic effect increases the polarity and reduces the bond order of the main dissociative bond in BTBO, resulting in a lower dissociation temperature for BTBO.",2024
Novel fluorine-containing energetic materials: how potential are they? A computational study of detonation performance,"ContextHigh-energy density materials (HEDMs) have emerged as a research focus due to their advantageous ultra-high detonation performance and better sensitivity. The primary aim of this study revolves around crafting HEDMs that strike a delicate balance between exceptional performance and minimal sensitivity. Density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to evaluate the geometric structures, energies, densities, energy properties, and sensitivities of 39 designed derivatives. The theoretical density (& rho;) and heat of formation (HOF) were used to estimate the detonation velocity (D) and pressure (P) of the title compounds. Our study shows that the introduction of fluorine-containing substituents or fluorine-free substituents into the CHOFN backbone or the CHON backbone can significantly enhance the detonation performance of derivatives. Derivative B1 exhibits the better overall performance, including superior density, detonation performance, and sensitivity (P = 58.89 GPa, D = 8.02 km/s, & rho; = 1.93 g/cm(3), and characteristic height H-50 = 34.6 cm). Our molecular design strategy contributes to the development of more novel HEDMs with excellent detonation performance and stability. It also marks a significant step towards a material engineering era guided by theory-based rational design.MethodsGaussView 6.0 was used for construction of molecular system coordinates, and Gaussian 16 was used to obtain optimal structures, energies, and volumes of all compounds at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. It was characterized to be the local energy minimum on the potential energy surface without imaginary frequencies at the same theory level. Molecular weight, isosurface area, and overall variance were obtained using the Multiwfn 3.3. The detonation properties of the materials were analyzed using the C-J thermodynamic detonation theory. Our broad analysis facilitated an extensive assessment of these properties.",2023
Effect of interface chemistry and strain rate on particle-matrix delamination in an energetic material,"In this work, interface mechanical strength of a set of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) interfaces is characterized using dynamic microscale impact experiments at strain rates up to 100 s(-1). The experiments were conducted on the interfaces with varying amount of binding agent Tepanol with an impacter of radius 1 mu m. Measurements of strain rates and plastic-residual depths were correlated to obtain the interface level strains and stresses. A power law viscoplastic constitutive model was fitted to the stress-strain-strain rate data in order to predict rate dependent constitutive behaviors of interfaces, particle, and matrix. An in-situ mechanical Raman spectroscopy (MRS) setup was used to analyze the effect of binding agent on interface level stress variation at different temperatures. The MRS setup is also used to obtain cohesive fracture separation properties in the analyzed samples including interface delamination strength and interface fracture energy. The measured cohesive fracture parameters capture the effect of interface chemistry variation. The cohesive parameters and the viscoplastic model obtained from the experiment were implemented in a cohesive finite element scheme to simulate dynamic crack propagation as well as delamination in model energetic material samples. Results quantify influence of the rate of loading and interface binding agent variation on rate dependent fracture. Results show that the time at which the interface delamination starts increases linearly with the increase in cohesive strength and decreases exponentially with an increase in loading rate.",2018
Controlled Synthesis and Application of Nano-energetic Materials Based on the Copper Oxide/Al System,"Nanothermite composites containing metal oxide and metal fuel are attracting attention due to their outstanding combustion characteristics. The morphology of metal oxide is important for the performance of nanothermite composites. In this paper, branch-, plate-, sphere-, and hollow sphere-like CuO nano/microstructures were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal process. The CuO/Al based nanothermites were prepared via ultrasonic mixing of the as-obtained CuO products and nano-Al. The combustion behaviour of CuO/Al based nanothermites was analyzed by DSC and laser ignition. This study shows that this nanoscale mixing resulted in a large interfacial contact area and low diffusional resistance between the fuel and the oxidizer, and the reaction reflects large energy and laser ignition sensitivity.",2015
Asymmetrical Methylene-Bridge Linked Fully Iodinated Azoles as Energetic Biocidal Materials with Improved Thermal Stability,"The instability and volatility of iodine is high, however, effective iodine biocidal species can be readily stored in iodinated azoles and then be released upon decomposition or detonation. Iodine azoles with high iodine content and high thermal stability are highly desired. In this work, the strategy of methylene bridging with asymmetric structures of 3,4,5-triiodo-1-H-pyrazole (TIP), 2,4,5-triiodo-1H-imidazol (TIM), and tetraiodo-1H-pyrrole (TIPL) are proposed. Two highly stable fully iodinated methylene-bridged azole compounds 3,4,5-triiodo-1-((2,4,5-triiodo-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-pyrazole (3) and 3,4,5-triiodo-1-((tetraiodo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-pyrazole (4) were obtained with high iodine content and excellent thermal stability (iodine content: 84.27% for compound 3 and 86.48% for compound 4; T-d: 3: 285 & DEG;C, 4: 260 & DEG;C). Furthermore, their composites with high-energy oxidant ammonium perchlorate (AP) were designed. The combustion behavior and thermal decomposition properties of the formulations were tested and evaluated. This work may open a new avenue to develop advanced energetic biocidal materials with well-balanced energetic and biocidal properties and versatile functionality.",2023
Hybrid Composites Based on Al/CuO Nanothermites and Tetraamminecopper Perchlorate for High-Performance Energetic Materials,"Nanothermites have high energy densities and fast reactionspeeds,but their applications are restrained by their relatively low gasgeneration capacity owing to the lack of gaseous products. By contrast,nitrogen-rich explosives can release substantial small-molecule gasesupon intramolecular decomposition. Recently, the integration of nanothermiteswith nitrogen-rich explosives has attracted growing interest to attainimproved reactive performances. In this work, hybrid energetic compositescomposed of Al/CuO nanothermites and tetraamminecopper perchlorate(TACP) were prepared. The reaction behaviors of pure TACP and a seriesof Al/CuO/TACP composites were systematically investigated. Duringthe dynamic heating in thermogravimetry coupled with differentialscanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), the total heat release of Al/CuO/TACPcomposites was basically the linear combination of Al/CuO (2.23 kJ/g)and TACP (1.44 kJ/g) based on their mass contents. However, the additionof n-Al and n-CuO could lower the decomposition temperature of TACPby 20 & DEG;C, and the chlorides produced from TACP decompositionwere found to promote the oxidation of n-Al. Compared with sole Al/CuOand sole TACP, the hybrid composites with TACP content of 10-25%showed considerably strengthened blast performances and significantlyenhanced gas generation capacities. The maximum pressure and pressurizationrate of Al/CuO/TACP_25% (1.67 MPa, 199.3 MPa/s) far exceed those ofAl/CuO (1.01 MPa, 93.3 MPa/s). Owing to their superior reactivity,Al/CuO/TACP hybrid composites show promising potential as high-performanceenergetic materials for applications, including green primary explosivesand gas generators.",2023
Catalytic decomposition and crack resistance of composite energetic material synthesized by recrystallizing with graphene oxide,"Catalysis and crack resistance are essential for the combustion and structure performances of composite energetic materials. Currently, catalysis is dominated by toxic metals, and chemical coupling agents are always needful for fabricating the robust interface to resist cracks, without a feasible green alternative method. In this work, a recrystallization method was developed in pure water, by which graphene oxide (GO) was perfectly coated on NaNO3 particles without any coupling agent. The particle size of NaNO3/GO is much smaller than that of pure NaNO3, due to the inhibition of GO to the growth of NaNO3 crystals. The ultrathin GO coating on the NaNO3 presents effective catalytic activity on the thermal decomposition of NaNO3 and crack resistance capability in the NaNO3/GO/polyurethane composites. This green and effective approach may open up the opportunities to develop various high-performance composite energetic materials with great potential.",2019
Directional fracturing of granite cylinder via nitromethane-based energetic materials driven by electrical wire explosion,"The combination of electrical wire explosion and low sensitivity energetic materials is an efficient and practical method to generate controllable strong pressure waves, which is a potential alternative to explosives in directional fracturing applications. In this paper, a new configuration of hybrid load is proposed to generate synchronized pressure waves for directional fracturing, with the advantages of lower energy storage and smaller blast-hole diameters. The pressure wave of hybrid load explosion is measured, and the explosion synchronicity of the two loads at the microsecond level is verified by self-illumination images. Then, two-hole granite cylinders are used to verify the feasibility of directional fracturing, and the results show that the double loads explosion formed directional fractures connecting the two holes and a horizontal failure plane. The fracturing process, including fracture initiation, propagation, and connection, is recorded with a high-speed camera and is reproduced in numerical simulation. Based on the experimental and numerical results, the fracture morphology is characterized as four areas, and the fracturing mechanism is analyzed.",2023
Crack nucleation and growth induced by thermal phase transition for polymer bonded energetic composite materials,"Understanding thermophysical and thermomechanical damage behaviors of polymer-bonded energetic composite materials (PBECMs) is fundamental to the design of advanced safe munition structures. Herein, the effects of thermal expansion and phase transition in energetic crystal, thermal softening of binders, binder-crystal interface debonding, and heating rate on cracking damage in PBECMs are quantitated from the viewpoint of mechanics. An original thermomechanical crystal model integrating with anisotropic thermoelasticity, thermal expansion and phase transition is developed for energetic crystal. Damage and debonding at the interface and intracrystalline fracture are modelled by a bilinear traction-separation cohesive law. The results show that the occurrence of phase transition induces a prominent increase of volume deformation and contributes to mutual compression between crystals and mismatch shear deformation at the interface, thereby multiplying crack density. Inhomogeneous thermal stress field and crack distributions are related to anisotropic thermal expansion and phase transition behaviors of crystals. The predicted thermally cracking behaviors in PBECMs, including critical temperature to crack formation, crack nucleation position and growth mode, are consistent with experimental results.",2023
Molecular signal as a signature for detection of energetic materials in filament-induced breakdown spectroscopy,"Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) by self-channeled femtosecond pulses is characterized for detection of energetic materials. Different polymers are spin coated on silicon wafers to provide a thin organic layer with controllable thickness ranging from 500 nm to 1 mu m. Spectral analysis of atomic and molecular carbon emission shows CN molecular signal from samples that do not contain nitrogen. This can be explained by possible molecular recombination between native atomic carbon and atmospheric nitrogen. As a consequence, caution must be exercised when using spectral signatures based on CN emission for explosive detection by filament-induced LIBS.",2009
Building Chemical Property Models for Energetic Materials from Small Datasets Using a Transfer Learning Approach,"For many experimentally measured chemical properties that cannot be directly computed from first-principles, the existing physics-based models do not extrapolate well to out-of-sample molecules, and experimental datasets themselves are too small for traditional machine learning (ML) approaches. To overcome these limitations, we apply a transfer learning approach, whereby we simultaneously train a multi-target regression model on a small number of molecules with experimentally measured values and a large number of molecules with related computed properties. We demonstrate this methodology on predicting the experimentally measured impact sensitivity of energetic crystals, finding that both characteristics of the computed dataset and model architecture are important to prediction accuracy of the small experimental dataset. Our directed-message passing neural network (D-MPNN) ML model using transfer learning outperforms direct-ML and physics-based models on a diverse test set, and the new methods described here are widely applicable to modeling many other structure-property relationships.",2022
Effects of bimetallic catalysts on synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as nanoscale energetic materials,"Well aligned nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNx-NTs), as energetic materials, are synthesized on a silicon substrate by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) metals are respectively introduced to combine with iron (Fe) to act as a bimetallic co-catalyst layer. Correlations between the composition and shape of the co-catalyst and morphology, size, growth rate and nitrogen doping amount of the synthesized CNx-NTs are investigated by secondary and backscattered electron imaging in a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). Compared to pure iron catalyst. W-Fe co-catalyst can result in lower growth rate, larger diameter and wider size distribution of the CNx-NTs; while incorporation of molybdenum into the iron catalyst layer can reduce the diameter and size distribution of the nanotubes. Compared to the sole iron catalyst, Fe-W catalyst impedes nitrogen doping while Fe-Mo catalyst promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into the nanotubes. The present work indicates that CNx-NTs with modulated size, growth rate and nitrogen doping concentration are expected to be synthesized by tuning the size and composition of co-catalysts, which may find great potential in producing CNx-NTs with controlled structure and properties.

Combustion instability of the energetic materials: from microstructures of physical fields to macro-scale properties,"Over the last 60 years, a considerable amount of time and money has been spent improving our understanding of combustion instability of the energetic materials (EM). The present state of theory and experiment has not provided a sufficiently strong foundation to provide a complete basis for prediction. Hence there are only a few guidelines available to help designers avoid combustion instabilities. In the last years, researchers have observed the excitation of the spatial periodic micro-structures (SPMS) and the presence of micro torches at the burning surface of the EM with well pronounced exothermic reactions in the condensed phase and evaporation on the burning surface. Both experiments and theory confirm that the SPMS excitation is a rather universal phenomenon. The electric field micro-structures in the liquid-viscous layer gives the program for formation of the cellular pulsating micro-structures in the heated-up layer and on the burning surface of the EM. ""Wandering"" micro-torches on the burning surface causes excitation of the micro-vortex cells the periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures. In the paper the physical mechanism of excitation of the toroidal-shaped vortex micro-structures over the burning surface is considered. Excitation of the periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures above the burning surface causes increase of the heat flow from the gas phase into the burning surface and, as a result, local increase of the burning rate. Thus, the near-wall periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures form a Circulating layer (C-layer) with a high thermal conductivity, which intensifies the thermal conductivity of the turbulent core of the flow. At increase of the blowing velocity occurs partial destruction of the micro-vortex toroidal structures and reduction of the thickness of the C-layer that leads to reduction of the heat supply to the burning surface. This layer is the basic link between the electric field micro-structures in the liquid-viscous layer and macro-scale properties of the propulsion system. Active controlling by self-organizing processes of the spatial-periodic micro-structures in the EM liquid-viscous layer and on the EM burning surface opens possibilities for efficient control by the C-layer over the burning surface of the EM. In the paper the modern electro-physical technologies for control by physical-chemical processes in the EM burning wave are analyzed.",2010
Stable organic azides based on rigid tetrahedral methane and adamantane structures as high energetic materials,"A four-folded azidation of tetrakis(4-iodophenyl) methane and -adamantane leads to stable organic azides, but yet energetic-materials, measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The rigid and symmetrical structures can be useful for new polymer and nanomaterial developments in material sciences as well as bioconjugations, after 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions with terminal alkynes to 1,2,3-triazoles.",2007
Exploring pressure-dependent inelastic deformation and failure in bonded granular composites: An energetic materials perspective,"In polymer-filled granular composites, damage may develop in mechanical loading prior to material failure. Damage mechanisms such as microcracking or plastic deformation in the binder phase can substantially alter the material's mesostructure. For energetic materials, such as solid propellants and plastic bonded explosives, these mesostructural changes can have far reaching effects including degraded mechanical properties, poten-tially increased sensitivity to further insults, and changes in expected performance. Unfortunately, predicting damage is nontrivial due to the complex nature of these composites and the entangled interactions between inelastic mechanisms. In this work, we assess the current literature of experimental knowledge, focusing on the pressure-dependent shear response, and propose a simple simulation framework of bonded particles to study four limiting-case material formulations at both meso-and macro-scales. To construct the four cases, we systematically vary the relative interfacial strength between the polymer binder and granular filler phase and also vary the polymer's glass transition temperature relative to operating temperature which determines how much the binder can plastically deform. These simulations identify key trends in global mechanical response, such as the emergence of strain hardening or softening regimes with increasing pressure which qualitatively resemble experimental results. By quantifying the activation of different inelastic mechanisms, such as bonds breaking and plastically straining, we identify when each mechanism becomes relevant and provide insight into potential origins for changes in mechanical responses. The locations of broken bonds are also used to define larger, mesoscopic cracks to test various metrics of damage. We primarily focus on triaxial compression, but also test the opposite case of triaxial extension to highlight the impact of Lode angle on mechanical behavior.",2023
Facile electro-thermal igniters based on freestanding CNTs films for the ignition of energetic materials,"Facile electro-thermal igniters based on freestanding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) films are investigated for exploring the use of igniting energetic materials. Increases in electro-thermal temperature, dynamic pictures of ignition process, and temporal changes of voltage, current and resistance as well as the ignition ability of freestanding CNTs film-based igniters with different film thickness are compared with their counterparts with paper-like substrate. The results demonstrated that freestanding CNTs film-based igniters had faster rise in electro-thermal temperature and better ignition ability than their counterparts. The ignition delay of loaded energetic materials employing freestanding CNTs film based-igniters was only 40%-67% of their counterparts depending on the film thickness. Freestanding CNTs film-based igniters with larger thicknesses were more suitable for the rapid ignition of energetic materials. The shortest ignition delay for igniters of 8 x 8 mm bridge area under 20 V was less than 80 ms. The initial temperature rise rate of igniters was crucial for deciding the ignition delays of loaded energetic materials. The presence of substrates in CNTs film-based igniters impeded their temperature rise rate and thus increased the ignition delay of loaded energetic materials. Moreover, due to the property of negative resistance-temperature coefficient, freestanding CNTs film-based igniters are favourable for the realization of low voltage ignition of energetic materials.",2022
"Structural, elastic, vibrational and optical properties of energetic material octanitrocubane studied from first-principles theory","We present a thorough density functional theory based computational study of crystalline properties of cubane caged potential energetic material octanitrocubane (ONC). As expected for a layered molecular solid, van der Waals corrections are inevitable and the same has been incorporated to capture the ground state properties more accurately. Study of Born effective charge and zone centered phonon frequencies using density functional perturbation theory reveals the important role of N2, N4 type nitrogen and associated oxygen atoms in contributing to the high intensity infrared modes. From the calculated electronic band structure we can conclude that ONC is an insulator with a band gap of 5.31 eV. The optical properties of ONC are found to be nearly isotropic in low energy region in spite of strong anisotropic crystal structure.",2020
Synthesis and Characterization of a Thermally and Hydrolytically Stable Energetic Material based on N-Nitrourea,"The novel primary explosive tetranitrodiglycoluril (TNDGU) was synthesized from glycoluril dimer. It was fully characterized by using NMR (H-1, C-13), IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystals of TNDGU belong to triclinic system with space group P (1) over bar. The thermal behavior of TNDGU was studied using DSC methods. TNDGU exhibited good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 284.8 degrees C. TNDGU was also more resistant to hydrolysis compared to other nitrourea analogues. Additionally, density, enthalpy of formation, detonation velocity (VOD), and detonation pressure of TNDGU were predicted and it was found that TNDGU is a potential powerful explosive with a calculated density of 1.93 g cm(-3), a detonation velocity of 8305 m s(-1) and low sensitivity to electric discharge.",2014
" Synthesized Energetic Salts Based on the C-N Fused Tricyclic 3,9-Diamine-6,7-Dihydro-Bis(triazolo)-Tetrazepine Cation: A Family of High-Performance Energetic Materials","A new family of 3,9-diamino-6,7-dihydro-5H-bis([1,2,4]triazolo)[4,3-e:3,4-g][1,2,4,5]tetrazepine-2,10-diium salts was explored as fused tricyclic triazole based energetic materials. These salts and their fused cations were constructed by insitu synthesis with 4,4,5,5-tetraamino-3,3-bi-1,2,4-triazole as the raw material. All of the new compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, H-1, C-13, and (in some cases) N-15 NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. The structures of five salts were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Computational studies associated with heats of formation and detonation properties were performed by using Gaussian 09 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, respectively. The desired fused tricyclic energetic salts (especially for 4 and 5, d: 1.85-1.92gcm(-3); D: 8622-8942ms(-1); P: 34.61-37.38GPa) display interesting thermal behaviour and are predicted to be high-performance energetic materials.",2018
Initial decomposition reaction of di-tetrazine-tetroxide (DTTO) from quantum molecular dynamics: implications for a promising energetic material,"Di-tetrazine-tetroxide (DTTO) was predicted in 2001 to have a density (up to 2.3 g cm(-3)) and heat of detonation (up to 421.0 kcal mol(-1)) better than other explosives, making it the ""holy grail"" of energetic materials (EMs), but all attempts at synthesis have failed. We report Density Functional Theory (DFT) molecular dynamics simulations (DFT-MD) on DTTO crystal for the two most stable monomers. We predict that the most stable isomer (c1) has a density of rho = 1.96 g cm(-3) with an estimated detonation velocity (D-v) of 9.70 km s(-1) and a detonation pressure (D-p) of 43.0 GPa, making it comparable to RDX (rho = 1.82 g cm(-3), D-v = 8.75 km s(-1), D-p = 35.0 GPa), HMX (rho = 1.91 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.10 km s(-1), D-p = 39.3 GPa) and CL-20 (rho = 2.04 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.38 km s(-1), D-p = 44.1 GPa). The DFT-MD studies find that the initial reaction at lower pressure is unimolecular decomposition to form two N2O molecules (barrier 45.9 kcal mol(-1)), while at higher pressure it is intermolecular oxygen-transfer with a barrier of 40.1 kcal mol(-1). For the c2 isomer (less stable by 1.2 kcal mol(-1)) the initial reaction involves two DTTO molecules reacting to form a dimer which then releases N-2 as a direct product (barrier 48.1 kcal mol(-1)), a unique initial reaction among EMs. These results suggest that DTTO may have a higher thermal stability (barrier >7.0 kcal mol(-1) higher) than RDX, HMX, and CL-20.",2015
The Effects of Material's Transport on Various Steps of Production System on Energetic Efficiency of Biodiesel Production,"Rapeseed plantation biodiesel production systems require the transportation of goods, like raw materials, machines and tools, and products between various conversion stages of agricultural as well as industrial subsystems. Each transportation step requires the consumption of some energy. This consumption decreases the net amount of energy delivered out of the biofuel production system, and consequently decreases the energetic efficiency of the system. The majority of studies on biofuel sustainability are done by means of the LCA method with the use of a data average for some region and period of time. Such analyses do not reveal the possible causes of the conclusions determined. The present work deals with computer modelling of the influence of the energy consumed on those transport routes on the energetic efficiency of the production system. The model enables determination of the effects caused by changes introduced to technological parameters. The effects caused by variation of fuel consumption, the load capacity of transportation means, size of plantation, distribution and sizes of individual fields, distances between fields, plantation yield, and finally the distance between the plantation and the industrial facility are studied using the numerical model developed earlier. This approach is aimed towards identifying the reasons for the behavior of a system controlled by many somewhat coupled variables.",2018

According to the results of NMR, single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and DSC, this compound has a high density (1.833 g center dot cm(-3)) and positive heat of formation (681.3 kJ center dot mol(-1)). The calculated detonation velocity (D = 9045 m center dot s(-1)), pressure (P= 37.1 GPa), and sensitivity (IS = 40 J) are better than that of RDX ((D = 8795 m center dot s(-1),P= 34.9 GPa, IS = 7.4 J), which indicated that this material is a potential substitute for the traditional energetic materials.",2020
Harnessing triazole-oxadiazole-trinitromethyl moieties in the synthesis of insensitive energetic material with enhanced detonation performance,"The nitrogen-and oxygen-rich azole-based high energetic compound 3,3 '-(2-(trinitromethyl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-diyl)-bis(1,2,4-oxadiazole) (5) was synthesized from a readily accessible bis-cyano-substituted-azole in three steps with an overall good yield. The reaction sequence was even successful on the gram scale. The five-membered azole backbone with a -C(NO2)3 group contributes to boosting energetic properties of the molecule. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized using NMR, IR, HRMS, and TGA-DSC studies. X-ray diffraction analysis established the molecular topology of the desired compound. The molecule showed promising energetic performance with a good oxygen balance (-31.6%), high positive heat of formation (+679.8 kJ mol-1), and high detonation pressure (P = 29.6 GPa) and velocity (Dv = 8356 m s-1), which are close to those of PETN, superior to those of HNS, and surpass those of TNT. Hirshfeld surface analysis gives insights into the molecule's sensitivity. The nitrogen-and oxygen-rich azole-based high energetic compound 3,3 '-(2-(trinitromethyl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-diyl)-bis(1,2,4-oxadiazole) was synthesized from a readily accessible bis-cyano-substituted-azole in three steps with good yield.",2024
Linear furoxan assemblies incorporating nitrobifuroxan scaffold: En route to new high-performance energetic materials,"Energetic materials science is undergoing a global renaissance aiming to reach an ideal combination between reliable synthetic strategies, high performance and acceptable molecular stabilities. In this work, design and synthesis of novel energetic non-hydrogen furoxan assemblies has been successfully realized. Fine tunability of molecular composition in a series of furoxan-based materials was achieved by the variation of a number of heterocyclic rings and employing N-oxide regioisomerism strategy. Using this approach, advanced energetic regioisomeric azo-bridged bifuroxan assemblies 6 and 7 as well as 3,4 & PRIME;-dinitro-3 & PRIME;,4-bifuroxan 8 with the excellent overall performance were synthesized. Calculations of Hirshfeld surfaces and molecular electrostatic potentials were conducted to better understand the relationship between the molecular structure and mechanical sensitivity in the synthesized series of energetic materials. It was found, that the supramolecular aggregation of 3,4 & PRIME;-dinitro3 & PRIME;,4-bifuroxan 8 molecules in crystal is more anisotropic that is commonly believed to be more favorable pattern for the low sensitive substances. All target materials have high densities (1.88-1.95 g cm-3), acceptable thermal stabilities (up to 165 degrees C), high enthalpies of formation (1.6-2.4 kJ g-1) and positive oxygen balance to CO (up to + 25%). As a result, these compounds exhibit high detonation velocities (9.1-9.5 km s-1), excellent heats of explosion (6.6-7.2 kJ g-1) and combustion performance (Isp = 269-281 s). Therefore, these furoxan-based advanced energetic materials unveil new opportunities in search of next-generation functional organic materials for various applications.",2023
Atomic mean square displacement study of the bond breaking mechanism of energetic materials before explosive initiation,"Understanding and predicting the bond breaking mechanism of energetic materials before explosion initiation is one of the huge challenges in explosion science. By means of the mean square displacement of the atom from the equilibrium position and theoretical bond breaking tensile change of the chemical bond, we establish a new criterion to judge whether the chemical bond is broken. Further, alpha-RDX is used as the verification object to verify the accuracy of this model. We obtained an initial decomposition temperature of 434-513 K for alpha-RDX at 0 GPa, and the initial bond breaking type was N-NO2. Finally, based on this model, we discussed in detail the breaking of chemical bonds of solid nitromethane near the detonation pressure. We think that the high temperature and high pressure caused by the shock wave may break all the chemical bonds of nitromethane near the detonation pressure.",2023
STUDY OF THERMAL SENSITIVITY AND THERMAL EXPLOSION VIOLENCE OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS IN THE LLNL ODTX SYSTEM,"Some energetic materials may explode at fairly low temperatures and the violence from thermal explosion may cause a significant damage. Thus it is important to understand the response of energetic materials to thermal insults for safe handling and storage of energetic materials. The One Dimensional Time to Explosion (ODTX) system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can measure times to explosion, lowest explosion temperatures, and determine kinetic parameters of energetic materials. Samples of different configurations can be tested in the system. The ODTX testing can also generate useful data for determining thermal explosion violence of energetic materials. We also performed detonation experiments of LX-10 in aluminum anvils to determine the detonation violence and validated the Zerilli Armstrong aluminum model. Results of the detonation experiments agreed well with the model prediction.",2012
Experimental Setup for Assessing the Energetic Materials Deflagration Propagation under High Temperature and High Pressure Conditions,"The technology of ""explosion in fractures"" is one of new synthetic engineering methods used in low permeability reservoirs. The most important problem arose from the technology is to assess the deflagration propagation capability of milky explosives in rock fractures. In order to investigate detailed this problem in the laboratory, an experimental setup was designed and developed in which different conditions can be simulated. The experimental setup mainly includes two parts. One is the experimental part and the other is the measurement part. In the experimental setup, the narrow slots with different width can be simulated; meanwhile, different initial pressures and initial temperatures can be loaded on the explosives inside the narrow slots. The initial pressure range is from 0-60 MPa, and the initial temperatures range is from room temperature to 100 V. The temperature and the velocity of deflagration wave can be measured; meanwhile the corresponding pressure in the narrow slot is also measured. In the end, some typical measurement results are briefly presented and discussed.",2009
The design and synthesis of new advanced energetic materials based on pyrazole-triazole backbones,"A series of derivatives of the nitropyrazole-triazole backbone were designed through units' screening of 219 N-heterocycle compounds and were synthesized. Among them, the thermal stability of DNPAT (T-dec = 314 degrees C) is close to that of traditional heat-resistant explosive HNS (318 degrees C) while the detonation performance and sensitivity (D = 8889 m s(-1); IS = 18 J) are better than those of HNS (D = 7612 m s(-1); IS = 5 J) and traditional high-energy explosive RDX (D = 8795 m s(-1); IS = 7.4 J), which is rarely reported in heat-resistant explosives. Moreover, compounds 4 and 6 show excellent performances (IS > 15 J, D > 9090 m s(-1), P > 37.0 GPa), illustrating that compounds 4 and 6 may be used as secondary explosives. All these results enrich prospects for the development of energetic materials.",2023
"Thermal studies of novel heat-resistant 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c] pyrazole-based energetic materials","1,4-Bis(2 ',4 ',6 '-trinitrophenyl)- 3,6-dinitro[4,3-c]pyrazole (DTNBDNP) is a newly developed heat-resistant explosive exhibiting superior properties to most traditional heat-resistant energetic materials with a significantly high thermal decomposition temperature of 410 degrees C. Detailed thermal behaviors and nonisothermal decomposition kinetics of DTNBDNP and 1,4-bis(2 ',4 '-dinitrophenyl)- 3,6-dinitro[4,3-c]pyrazole (DDNBDNP) were investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and the thermal safety was evaluated by different criteria, including the self-accelerating decomposition temperature and critical temperature of thermal explosion. Their thermodynamic functions were also obtained based on the specific heat capacity data determined using a micro-DSC method. Further studies on the thermal decomposition mechanism were carried out through condensed-phase thermolysis/Fourier transform infrared (in situ FTIR) spectroscopy and the combination of differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DSC-TG-MS-FTIR) techniques. The experimental results prove that the decomposition of DTNBDNP and DDNBDNP is most likely to begin with a ring-opening reaction of the fused-heterocycle backbone. In addition, the main gaseous products, including NO, CO2, N2O, and NO2, are released from the decomposition of DTNBDNP and DDNBDNP.",2023
Strategy of improving the stability and detonation performance for energetic material by introducing the boron atoms,"A novel stable energetic compound (E)-1,2-diamino-1,2-dinitrodiboron (DANB) was theoretically designed based on the structure of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7). Atomization method in combination with Hess' law was used to predict the heat of formation. The detonation velocity (D) and detonation pressure (P) of DANB were approximatively estimated by using Kamlet-Jacobs equations. As a result, DANB has huge heat of formation (2013.5kJ/mol) and specific enthalpy of combustion (-26.4kJ/g). Furthermore, DANB possesses high crystal density (1.85g/cm(3)) and heat of detonation (5476.0cal/g), which lead to surprising detonation performance (D=10.72km/s, P=51.9GPa) that is greater than those of FOX-7 (D=8.63km/s, P=34.0GPa) and CL-20 (D=9.62km/s, P=44.1GPa). More importantly, DANB is very stable because its bond dissociation energy of the weakest bond (BDE=357.8kJ/mol) is larger than those of the most common explosives, such as FOX-7 (BDE=200.4kJ/mol), CL-20(BDE=209.2kJ/mol), HMX(BDE=165.7kJ/mol), and RDX (BDE=161.4kJ/mol). Therefore, our results show that DANB is a promising candidate for stable and powerful energetic material.",2017
Modulation of the Reactivity of a WO,"Although pyrotechnic performance is fundamental, the strong mechanical and electrostatic intrinsic sensitivities of nanothermite energetic composites represent an obstacle to their development. The addition of a ternary component to the classical binary energetic composite appears to be a promising idea to overcome the problem. A carbon black additive (V3G) was used on a WO3/Al nanothermite. The effect of the pristine and modified carbon particles on the mechanical and electrical sensitivities of the composites was measured together with the pyrotechnic properties. The results show a complete desensitization to friction with a ball-milled carbon when the combustion velocity is slightly reduced.",2015
Preparation and Properties of an AP/RDX/SiO2 Nanocomposite Energetic Material by the Sol-Gel Method,"A nanocomposite energetic material was prepared using sol-gel processing. It was incorporated into the nano or submicrometer-sized pores of the gel skeleton with a content up to 95?%. AP, RDX, and silica were chosen as the energetic crystal and gel skeleton, respectively. The structure and its properties were characterized by SEM, BET methods, XRD, TG/DSC, and impact sensitivity measurements. The structure of the AP/RDX/SiO2 cryogel is of micrometer scale powder with numerous pores of nanometer scale and the mean crystal size of AP and RDX is approx. 200 nm. The specific surface area of the AP/RDX/SiO2 cryogel is 36.6 m2?g-1. TG/DSC analyses indicate that SiO2 cryogel can boost the decomposition of AP and enhance the interaction between AP and RDX. By comparison of the decomposition heats of AP/RDX/SiO2 at different mass ratios, the optimal mass ratio was estimated to be 6.5/10/1 with a maximum decomposition heat of 2160.8 J?g-1. According to impact sensitivity tests, the sensitivity of the AP/RDX/SiO2 cryogel is lower than that of the pure energetic ingredients and their mixture.",2012
Enhancing Conjugation Effect to Develop Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Materials with Higher Energy and Stability,"This work reports a strategy by enhancing conjugation effect and synthesizes a symmetrical and planar compound, 1,2-bis (4,5-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)diazene ( NL24 ). The incorporation of azo and 1,2,3-triazole moieties manifests a synergistic effect, amplifying the conjugation effect of the azo bridge and thereby elevating the stability of  NL24  (T-d: 263 degrees C, IS: 7 J). Notably,  NL24 , possessing a structural configuration comprising four tetrazoles harboring a total of 24 nitrogen atoms, exhibits excellent detonation performances (Delta H-f: 6.06 kJ g(-1), V-D: 9002 m s(-1)). This strategy achieves the balance of energy and stability of polycyclic tetrazoles and provides a direction for high-performance energetic materials.",2024
Detonation properties and sensitivities of a series of -NHNH-/-N = N- bridged tetrazole-based energetic materials,"To obtain novel high-energy density compounds with superior detonation properties and sensitivity to those of RDX, a series of furazan/tetrazole/tetrazine-tetrazole-N = N-tetrazole-furazan/tetrazole/tetrazine and furazan/tetrazole/tetrazine-tetrazole-NHNH-tetrazole-furazan/tetrazole/tetrazine-based energetic materials were designed. Their structures were optimised by Gaussian software with density functional theory at B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level. Based on the optimised structures, their frontier orbital energies, heats of formation and detonation properties were calculated. The results indicate that the compound with tetrazole-tetrazole-N = N-tetrazole-tetrazole parent structure and -N3 energetic group has the highest value of heat of formation while the compound with tetrazine-tetrazole-NHNH-tetrazole-tetrazine parent structure and -C(NO2)(3) energetic group possess the highest values of detonation velocity and detonation pressure. Most of the designed compounds have higher values of h50 than those of RDX (28 cm) and HMX (32 cm), and series E had higher average values of impact sensitivity. Finally, taking detonation properties and impact sensitivity into consideration, six compounds (A2, A8, C8, D2, F7 and F8) were selected as potential candidate materials for high-energy density materials, and their electronic and physicochemical properties were investigated.

Unraveling the direct effect of hydrogen bonding on density and thermostability of energetic materials through isomerism,"Introduction of additional donors or acceptors for strengthening hydrogen-bonding (HB) interactions is one of the most commonly utilized methods to improve the density and thermostability of organic functional materials, including energetic materials. However, this method can lead to changes in the molecular composition, obscuring the direct effects of HB. To address this issue, we propose an effective strategy, based on isomerism, for determining the direct effects of HB interactions. We designed and synthesized two isomers, 2,4,6,8-tetranitro-1,5-diamine-naphthalene (3a) and 1,3,6,8-tetranitro-2,7-diamine-naphthalene (3b). X-ray diffraction analysis, quantum calculations, and experimental investigations revealed that 3a, which has stronger a intermolecular HB, exhibits closer molecular packing and, thus, a higher density (1.905 g cm(-3)) than 3b (1.840 g cm(-3)). By contrast, 3b, which has a stronger intramolecular HB, exhibits a higher degree of aromaticity and, thus, a higher ther-mostability (decomposition temperature (T-d) = 330 degrees C) than 3a (Td = 256 degrees C). Thus, after eliminating inter-ference from compositional changes, it is clear that stronger intermolecular HB interactions are conducive to an increase in density, whereas stronger intramolecular HB interactions are conducive to a thermostability increase. In addition, the densities and thermostabilities of 3a and 3b are high, and the preparation method is simple, involving only two steps. Both compounds are highly insensitive (IS > 40 J and FS > 360 N), and the detonation performance is comparable to that of HNS and PYX. These results strongly suggest that 3a and 3b could be applied as insensitive heat-resistant energetic materials.",2022
Enforced Planar FOX-7-like Molecules: A Strategy for Thermally Stable and Insensitive π-Conjugated Energetic Materials,"Exploring new energetic derivatives of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) is still a key aspect in the field of energetic materials. However, so far most of the attention has been focused on modification of FOX-7 via different reaction strategies. Now we report the design of three new FOX-7-like compounds (3-5) where one nitro group in FOX-7 is replaced by a nitrogen-rich heterocyclic ring. Each of them is characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Electronic structures are studied through computational methods in comparison with FOX-7. In addition, the chemical reactivity of 3 was also investigated. Its hydroxylammonium (7), hydrazinium (8), and ammonium (9) salts were prepared, and the nitrate product (10) was also isolated. Compound 10 has a C-N bond length of 1.577 A that is one of the longest values found for the C-NO2 bond. It was found that the incorporation of a tetrazole or triazole ring into the backbone of a conjugated nitroenamine does lead to a planar structure, which not only enhances the thermal stability but also improves the sensitivity of the product.",2020
"Benchmarking composite methods for thermodynamic properties of nitro, nitrite, and nitrate species relevant to energetic materials","The thermochemistry of C/H/O/N compounds plays a fundamental role in understanding the reactivity and safety of energetic materials. Herein, a number of composite methods are used to compute bond dissociation energies and enthalpies of formation of C/H/O/N species with enough chemical diversity. The performance of the used five composite methods is systematically analyzed. The structural effect on the bond dissociation energies and enthalpy of formation of the studied species are analyzed. The present work not only provides valuable information for the selection of composite methods for C/H/O/N systems, but also highlights the foundation towards the synthesis of energetic materials.",2023
New insights on energetic properties of graphene oxide (GO) materials and their safety and environmental risks,"Graphene oxide (GO) has been recognized as a thermally unstable and energetic material, but surprisingly its environmental and safety risks were not fully explored, defined, and regulated. In this study, systematic explosivity and flammability characterizations of commercial GO materials were conducted to evaluate the influence of key parameters such as physical forms (paste, powders, films, and aerogels), temperature, heating rate, mass, and heating environment, as well as their potential safety and environmental impacts. Results based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that GO in paste and powder forms have lower temperature thresholds (>180-192 degrees C) to initiate micro-explosions compared to GO film and aerogels (> 205 degrees C and 213 degrees C) regardless of the environment (inert, air, or oxygen). The observed explosive behavior can be explained by thermal runaway reactions as a result of thermal deoxygenation and decomposition of oxygen functional groups. Flammability rating and limiting oxygen index (LOI) results confirmed that GOfilms are flammable materials that can spontaneously propagate flame in a lowoxygen environment (similar to 11 %). These results provided new insights about potential safety and environmental risks of GO materials, which somehow were not considered, suggesting urgent actions to improve current safety protocols for labeling, handling, transporting, and storage practices from manufacturers to the end-users.",2022
Modifying polynitro benzene and pyrazine skeletons with flexible nitratoethyl substituents towards new energetic melt-castable materials,"The development of new energetic melt-castable materials that can replace trinitrotoluene (TNT) is an important focus in energetic material research. Here, we developed a promising strategy for incorporating energetic flexible substituent groups onto a high-melting-point molecular skeleton to develop new energetic melt-castable materials. Using this method, five nitratoethyl-functionalized polynitro benzenes and pyrazines were synthesized. Among the prepared compounds, 1-(2-nitrato-ethylamino)-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (MSR-1) and 1-bis(2-nitratoethyl)amine-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (MSR-2) exhibited the potential as energetic melt-castable materials due to the desirable wide temperature range over which the materials were liquid, ranging from the melting point (T-m: 90.5 & DEG;C and 104.8 & DEG;C, respectively) to the high decomposition temperatures (T-d: 204.7 & DEG;C and 208.8 & DEG;C, respectively). Moreover, their densities (1.68 g cm(-3), 1.71 g cm(-3), respectively), detonation performances (7654 m s(-1), 7802 m s(-1), respectively) and impact sensitivities (20 J) were superior to those of TNT (1.65 g cm(-3), 7303 m s(-1), 15 J, respectively). A quantitative and accurate method of binding energy in cluster (BEC) is proposed to account for the melting-point differences in the prepared energetic compounds. The average binding energy between the close-contacting dimers in the molecular clusters showed strongly positive correlation with the molecular melting point.",2022
Energetic investigation of solar assisted heat pump underfloor heating systems with and without phase change materials,"The application of phase change materials (PCMs) in the building envelope can improve the thermal performance and the indoor thermal comfort conditions because they allow the proper storage or release of energy. In this work, three different solar assisted heat pump underfloor heating systems with and without the use of phase change material are designed, simulated and evaluated energetically for a building of 100 m(2) floor area. Different kinds of solar collectors (flat plate, photovoltaic, thermal photovoltaic) are coupled to a storage tank which feeds a heat pump for space heating purposes. The PCM is used on the underfloor heating system in order to increase the storage capacity and to avoid the operation of the heat pump during the peak electricity demand period. Furthermore, this work presents and compares the coefficient of performance, the electricity consumption, the solar coverage and the indoor temperature distribution of a building in Athens (Greece), with and without a PCM layer on the floor. More specifically, the PCM is placed on the underfloor heating system and different cases are examined by changing the collecting area, the collector type and the thickness of the insulation layer in the floor. The results prove that the use of the PCM layer on the underfloor heating system reduces the heating load by about 40%. The electricity consumption can be reduced between 42% and 67% using the solar-driven systems. It is also found that the system with the thermal PV consumes the lowest grid electricity. Moreover, the lowest simple payback period is found to be 9.61 years for the system with flat plate collectors without PCM. The simulation is conducted with TRNSYS for all the winter period.",2018
Shock response of single crystal and nanocrystalline pentaerythritol tetranitrate: Implications to hotspot formation in energetic materials,"We investigate shock response of single crystal and nanocrystalline pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) with a coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations, as regards mechanical hotspot formation in the absence or presence of grain boundaries (GBs). Single crystals with different orientations, and columnar nanocrystalline PETN with regular hexagonal, irregular hexagonal, and random GB patterns, are subjected to shock loading at different shock strengths. In single crystals, shock-induced plasticity is consistent with resolved shear stress calculations and the steric hindrance model, and this deformation leads to local heating. For regular-shaped hexagonal columnar nanocrystalline PETN, different misorientation angles lead to activation of different/same slip systems, different deformation in individual grains and as a whole, different GB friction, different temperature distributions, and then, different hotspot characteristics. Compared to their regular-shaped hexagonal counterpart, nanocrystalline PETN with irregular hexagonal GB pattern and that with random GBs, show deformation and hotspot features specific to their GBs. Driven by stress concentration, hotspot formation is directly related to GB friction and GB-initiated crystal plasticity, and the exact deformation is dictated by grain orientations and resolved shear stresses. GB friction alone can induce hotspots, but the hotspot temperature can be enhanced if it is coupled with GB-initiated crystal plasticity, and the slip of GB atoms has components out of the GB plane. The magnitude of shearing can correlate well with temperature, but the slip direction of GB atoms relative to GBs may play a critical role. Wave propagation through varying microstructure may also induce differences in stress states (e. g., stress concentrations) and loading rates, and thus, local temperature rise. GB-related friction and plasticity induce local heating or mechanical hotspots, which could be precursors to chemical hotspot formation related to initiation in energetic materials, in the absence of other, likely more effective, means for hotspot formation such as void collapse.

"Energetic Materials Based on 5,5-Diamino-4,4-dinitramino-3,3-bi-1,2,4-triazole","A simple and straightforward synthesis of 5,5-diamino-4,4-dinitramino-3,3-bi-1,2,4-triazole by the selective nitration of 4,4,5,5-tetraamino-3,3-bi-1,2,4-triazole is presented. The interaction of the amino and nitramino groups improves the energetic properties of this functionalized bitriazole.

The new compounds were investigated and characterized by spectroscopy (H-1 and (CNMR)-C-13, IR, Raman), elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray analysis, and impact and friction sensitivities (IS, FS). X-ray analyses were performed and deliver insight into structural characteristics with which the stability of the compounds can be explained. The standard enthalpies of formation were calculated for all compounds at the CBS-4M level of theory, revealing highly positive heats of formation. The energetic performance of the new molecules was predicted with the EXPLO5 V6.02 computer. A small-scale shock reactivity test (SSRT) and a toxicity test gave a first impression of the performance and toxicity of selective compounds.",2016
"Advanced tetracyclic heat-resistant energetic materials based on bis(4-nitropyrazole) bridged 1,2,4-triazole","In recent years, with the development of deep coal mines and petroleum resources and the expansion of the aerospace industry, the pursuit of heat-resistant energetic materials with high thermal stability and high energy has been increasing. Bis(4-nitropyrazole) was employed as an energy bridge to link 1,2,4-triazole, thereby constructing a sophisticated tetracyclic framework in this study. A tetracyclic heat-resistant explosive 5,5 '-(4,4 '-dinitro-2H,2 ' H-[3,3 '-bipyrazole]-5,5 '-diyl)bis(4H-1,2,4-triazole-3,4-diamine) (3) and its derivatives 6-8 with excellent comprehensive performance have been successfully prepared. Particularly noteworthy is that compound 3 has a detonation velocity of 8604 m s(-1), which exceeds that of the conventional heat-resistant explosive HNS with a velocity of 7164 m s(-1). Furthermore, compound 3 has higher thermal stability (T-d = 340 degrees C) than HNS (T-d = 318 degrees C). In addition, the tetracyclic compound 3 also exhibited extraordinarily low sensitivity (IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N). These unique characteristics make it a potential candidate for novel heat-resistant and insensitive energetic materials.",2024
Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen-Rich Azo-Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High-Performance Energetic Materials,"A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo-bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high-energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13, N-14) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4-oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen-oxygen contents (68.8-76.9 %) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62-1.88 g cm(-3)), very high enthalpies of formation (846-1720 kJ mol(-1)), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66-9.09 km s(-1) and detonation pressures 25.0-37.7 GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4-triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.",2021

AP/HMX co-crystal demonstrated an increase in HMX decomposition enthalpy by + 57.5%. HMX demonstrated activation energy of 343.2 and 354.4 kJ/mol using Kissinger and KAS models, respectively. AP/HMX co-crystal demonstrated a decrease in HMX activation energy by -75% and -76%, correspondingly. AP could act as an active point with the release of reactive gases that could boost HMX decomposition. HMX experienced a catalytic effect with the disappearance of AP endothermic phase transition.",2023
"An unexpected method to synthesise 1,2,4-oxadiazolone derivatives: a class of insensitive energetic materials","A new and effective method for the preparation of 3-(4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one is presented. In order to develop high energy density materials, compounds 3, 4 and 6 were synthesized by the simple nitration, oxidation and oxidation coupling reaction of compound 2. In addition, six energetic salts based on 3 and 4 were synthesized, respectively. Compounds 2-12 were characterized by IR spectroscopy, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The structures of compounds 2, 4 and 7 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, the energetic properties of compounds 3-12 including density (1.60-1.88 g cm(-3)), thermal stability (161.83-315.75 degrees C), except compound 3 which decomposed at 127.25 degrees C, and sensitivity were also investigated. The energetic performance (P: 22.25-35.81 GPa; D: 7749-8892 m s(-1)) from the experimental densities and calculated heats of formation suggests that many of them have potential applications as energetic materials.",2018
Theoretical study of the phonon-phonon scattering mechanism and the thermal conductive coefficients for energetic material,"The elastic constants and force constants of an energetic material named as 1,3,5-triamino- 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) are calculated by first-principles method under the GGA+vdW functional. Based on them, a physical picture to describe the phonon-phonon scattering mechanism is obtained, and a method to evaluate the thermal conductive tensor is developed. The resulting thermal conductivities are in agreement with the available experiments. We find that 20 vibrational modes play important roles in determining the heat exchange process of TATB. The vibrational direction, symmetry, displacement field and the detailed information of the key vibrational modes are obtained.",2017
Ni-Al Nanoscale Energetic Materials: Phenomena Involved During the Manufacturing of Bulk Samples by Cold Spray,"It has been shown that the cold-gas dynamic spraying process, or simply cold spray, is a suitable technique to manufacture nanoscale energetic materials with high reactivity and low porosity. The current study focuses on the Ni-Al system, for which the reactivity has been increased by an initial mechanical activation achieved by the ball-milling technique, leading to lamellar nanostructured composite particles. The consolidation of this nanoscale energetic material using the cold-gas dynamic spray technique permits to retain the feedstock powder nanoscale structure in the coatings, which in turn retain the high reactivity features of the powder. However, it has been noticed that the stagnation temperature during the spray can lead to partial reaction of the highly reactive feedstock powder, which directly influences the reactivity of the coatings. In this study, different stages of the spray process were investigated: (i) the in-flight behavior of the nanoscale energetic material (powder) at different stagnation temperatures (from 300 to 800 A degrees C); (ii) the substrate-temperature evolution as the function of gas temperature; and (iii) the impact of the powder on the substrate, related to particle's velocity and its influence on the nanostructure of the particles.",2014
Study of the relationship between pressure and sensitivity of energetic materials based on first-principles calculation,"Context In order to study the relationship between the sensitivity and pressure of energetic materials, six kinds of energetic materials were selected as the research object. The crystal structure, electronic, and phonon properties under hydrostatic pressure of 0 similar to 45 GPa were calculated by first principles. The calculation results show that the lattice parameters and band gap values of these six energetic materials decrease with the increase of pressure. The peak of the density of states decreases and moves to the low energy direction, and the electrons become more active. Meanwhile, the effect of pressure on the sensitivity of the energetic materials is analyzed based on the multi-phonon up-pumping theory. The number of doorway modes and integral of projected phonon density of states under high pressure is calculated. The results show that both of them increase with the increase of pressure. And the smaller the value of the band gap, the larger the number of doorway modes and integral of projected phonon density of states, and the more sensitive the energetic material is. Methods All calculations are performed using the Materials Studio software based on density functional theory. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to calculate the exchange correlation function, and the Grimme dispersion correction method is used to deal with the weak intermolecular interaction. The structure of the compound was optimized by BFGS algorithm. The linear response is used to calculate the phonon properties of energetic materials. The plane wave cutoff energy was set to 830 eV. The K-point grids of TATB, FOX-7, TNX, RDX, TNT, and HMX were chosen as 2 x 2 x 2, 2 x 2 x 1, 2 x 1 x 1, 1 x 1 x 1, 1 x 2 x 1, and 2 x 1 x 2.",2024

Progress in Additive Manufacturing of Energetic Materials: Creating the Reactive Microstructures with High Potential of Applications,"The modern ""energetic-on-a-chip"" trend envisages reducing size and cost while increasing safety and maintaining the performance of energetic articles. However, the fabrication of reactive structures at micro- and nanoscales remains a challenge due to the spatial limitations of traditional tools and technologies. These mature techniques, such as melt casting or slurry curing, represent the formative approach to design as distinct from the emerging additive manufacturing (3D printing). The present review discusses various methods of additive manufacturing based on their governing principles, robustness, sample throughput, feasible compositions and available geometries. For chemical composition, nanothermites are among the most promising systems due to their high ignition fidelity and energetic performance. Applications of reactive microstructures are highlighted, including initiators, thrusters, gun propellants, caseless ammunition, joining and biocidal agents. A better understanding of the combustion and detonation phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale along with the advancement of deposition technologies will bring further developments in this field, particularly for the design of micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) and propellant grains with improved performance.",2019
Prediction of the Strength of Energetic Materials Using the Condensed and Gas Phase Heats of Formation,"The strength of energetic materials is one of the principal parameters to express their performance. Two new methods were introduced for the prediction of the strength of CaHbNcOd energetic materials through the Trauzl test. They are based on elemental composition and the condensed or gas phase heats of formation of energetic compounds. The model is based on the gas phase heat of formation, uses the group additivity method and requires only the molecular structure of the desired energetic compound. These methods provide more reliable predictions as compared to the best available theoretical methods. Some of the benefits of these new models are their accuracy, precision, simplicity, and low price.",2015
Physically evocative meso-informed sub-grid source term for energy localization in shocked heterogeneous energetic materials,"Reactive burn models for heterogeneous energetic materials (EMs) must account for chemistry as well as microstructure to predict shock-to-detonation transition (SDT). Upon shock loading, the collapse of individual voids leads to ignition of hotspots, which then grow and interact to consume the surrounding material. The sub-grid dynamics of shock-void interactions and hotspot development are transmitted to macro-scale SDT calculations in the form of a global reactive ""burn model."" This paper presents a physically evocative model, called meso-informed sub-grid source terms for energy localization (MISSEL), to close the macro-scale governing equations for calculating SDT. The model parameters are explicitly related to four measurable physical quantities: two depending on the microstructure (the porosity phi and average pore size D (void)), one depending on shock-microstructure interaction (the fraction of critical voids xi(cr)), and the other depending on the chemistry (the burn front velocity V-hs). These quantities are individually quantifiable using a small number of rather inexpensive meso-scale simulations. As constructed, the model overcomes the following problems that hinder the development of meso-informed burn models: (1) the opacity of more sophisticated surrogate/machine-learning approaches for bridging meso- and macro-scales, (2) the rather large number of high-resolution mesoscale simulations necessary to train machine-learning algorithms, and (3) the need for calibration of many free parameters that appear in phenomenological burn models. The model is tested against experimental data on James curves for a specific class of pressed 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane materials. The simple, evocative, and fast-to-construct MISSEL model suggests a route to develop frameworks for physics-informed, simulation-derived meso-informed burn models.",2023
Graphitic coated Al nanoparticles manufactured as superior energetic materials via laser ablation synthesis in organic solvents,"The large heat release predicted in the early investigations of energetic aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) used in solid-state propulsion and pyrotechnics has been offset by hindered diffusion-limited detonation rates due to excess oxide shell formations and surface area loss from aggregations. We address these challenges by manufacturing graphitic shell coated Al NPs (< 20 nm sizes) via laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) to preserve high surface areas and interfacial properties of Al NPs. Specifically, we use a high-energy laser to ablate Al pellets confined in either acetone or toluene to coat the laser-ablated Al NPs with graphitic shells generated from the thermal pyrolysis of the organic solvents. Energetic activities of the C/Al NPs were tested via the laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) technique. We demonstrate that synthesis parameters such as organic solvents, laser flux and ablation times can be tuned to provide superior control of NP sizes/ag-gregation with the aid of the C shell formations and, in turn, their energetic behavior. This study unveils the synthesis-structure-property relations in LASiS-based manufacturing of energetic nanocapsules within graphitic shells that are safe to handle and can undergo kinetically controlled spontaneous energy release under desired conditions.",2019
Hydrogen bonding distribution and its effect on sensitivity of planar tricyclic polyazole energetic materials,"A series of planar tricyclic polyazole, energetic salts and energetic co-crystal were effectively synthesized via simple process from commercial materials. These structures of 5,5 & PRIME;-(2-nitro-1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(1H-tet-razole) (neutral compound 3), Ammonium 5,5 & PRIME;-(2-nitro-1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(1H-tetrazole) (4), Hydrox-ylammonium 5,5 & PRIME;-(2-nitro-1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(1H-tetrazole) (5) and Hydroxylamine . 2[5,5 & PRIME;-(2-nitro-1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(1H-tetrazole)] (co-crystal 7) which are combined with two neutral molecules 3 and one hyroxylamine were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Compared with the compounds 3 and 5, energetic co-crystal 7 exhibit better thermal stabilities with an increase of 31?degrees C or 62 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, compound 3 (IS: > 60 J; FS > 360 N), 4 (IS: > 60 J; FS > 360 N) and 5 (IS = 39 J; FS > 360 N) are nearly insensitive toward mechanical stimuli, but co-crystal 7 (IS < 1 J) possesses extremely high impact sensitivities. Crystal and Hirschfeld analyses have demonstrated that the difference of hydrogen bonding distribution lead to the extremely difference of sensitivity between neutral compound 3 and co-crystal 7, which will help to accel-erate the creating of new nitrogen-rich energetic materials for different applications.",2022
Molecular Dynamics Insight into the Evolution of Al Nanoparticles in the Thermal Decomposition of Energetic Materials,"It has become increasingly important to add Al nanoparticles (ANPs) into energetic materials (EMs) to overcome the issue of Al particles aggregation and promote the efficiency of heat release. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism for the role of ANPs in EMs still remains limited. By means of reactive molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF potential, the present work focuses upon the evolution of ANPs in a hot EM of 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triaminobenzene (TATB), which features very high insensitivity and O-lack. As a whole, adding ANPs unexceptionally increases heat release, and the morphological evolution of ANPs significantly depends on their sizes and contents, as the smaller size and the smaller content facilitate microexplosion. Moreover, a cracking of the core-shell structured Al@Al2O3 is observed in the hot TATB, as in oxygen. Besides Al-O bonds, Al-C and Al-N bonds are formed owing to the O-poor character of TATB. In addition, fusion of four ANPs in a model is observed as the reaction proceeds. A hollow alumina sphere is formed when adding an Al@Al(2)O(3 )particle to hot TATB, and it is found that there is an inward O transport and more O atoms concentrated around the center of an ANP with a relatively large size and high content. This work is expected to deepen insight into the complex reaction mechanism of ANPs-containing EMs.",2020
"The Pyridazine Scaffold as a Building Block for Energetic Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Properties","In the present studies, the synthesis of new energetic materials based on the pyridazine scaffold and their characterization is the main subject. For this purpose, desired 3,5-dimethoxy-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (7) was synthesized in the first instance. The persubstituted pyridazine precursor laid the groundwork for further preparative modification. The targeted functionalization through the regioselective introduction of various smaller amine nucleophiles such as methylamine or 2-aminoethanol gave several new energetic materials. Among them are 3,5-bis(methylamino)-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (8), 3,5-bis(methylnitramino)-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (9), 3,5-bis(dimethylamino)-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (10), and 3,5-bis((2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (11). With the aim of increasing the detonation performance, compound 8 was additionally nitrated and 3,5-bis(methylnitramino)-4,6-dinitropyridazine-1-oxide (9) was obtained. These new energetic materials were characterized and identified by multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13, N-14, N-15) and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. In addition, their sensitivities toward impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were thoroughly examined. Furthermore, obtained single-crystals of the substances were characterized by low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",2019

All the new compounds were fully characterized by IR, NMR [H-1, C-13 {H-1}], elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compounds 5, 6 and 8 were further characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Heats of formation and detonation performances were determined using Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, which show that 5 is a promising green primary explosive and 7 as a secondary explosive has a detonation velocity superior to 1,3,5-trinitro-triazacyclohexane (RDX).",2019
"Laminar, cellular, transverse, and multiheaded pulsating detonations in condensed phase energetic materials from molecular dynamics simulations","The development of condensed-phase detonation instabilities is simulated using moving window molecular dynamics and a generic AB model of a high explosive. It is found that an initially planar detonation front with one-dimensional flow can become unstable through development of transverse perturbations resulting in highly inhomogeneous and complex two- and three-dimensional distributions of pressure and other variables within the detonation front. Chemical reactions are initiated in localized transverse shock fronts and Mach stems with a pressure and temperature higher than those predicted by classic Zel'dovich, von Neumann, and Doering detonation theory. The two-dimensional cellular and transverse and three-dimensional pulsating detonation structures are found by varying the physico-chemical properties of AB energetic material, sample geometry, and boundary conditions. The different regimes of condensed-phase detonation that can develop from instabilities within a planar detonation front exhibit structures, although at a much smaller scale, that are similar to those observed in gases and diluted liquids.",2014
On the Implementation of a Limited Frequency Band Integrator and Application to Energetic Material Ignition Prediction,"This paper describes an algorithm for the implementation a fractional order integrator. This algorithm is based on a fractional integrator transfer function approximation by a recursive distribution of poles and zeros. This algorithm is then used to predict the ignition of energetic materials. For these materials, the ignition under low velocity impact can be predicted through the fractional integration of a local function of pressure and of shear strain rate inside the material. It is shown that the proposed algorithm allows obtaining accurate results with a low computational complexity.",2010
A reliable method for prediction of enthalpy of fusion in energetic materials using their molecular structures,"A new method is introduced to predict the enthalpy of fusion of energetic materials, which can undergo very rapid and highly exothermic reactions. It can be applied for different classes of energetic compounds including polynitro arenes, polynitro heteroarenes, acyclic and cyclic nitramines, nitrate esters, nitro-aliphatics, cyclic and acyclic peroxides as well as nitrogen rich compounds. This model is based on linear combination of elemental composition as additive part and two correcting functions as non-additive contributions, which depend on intermolecular interactions. It can be easily applied for energetic compounds containing complex molecular structure. For 194 different energetic compounds (corresponding to 233 measured values), the predicted results of this simple model, on the basis of additive contribution and correcting functions, give more reliable results as compared to two of the best available predictive methods.

The predicted results were compared with several of the best available methods, which confirmed the higher reliability of the new computer code for some new and well-known energetic compounds with complex molecular structures. This code can be used for designing of energetic compounds with desirable phase change properties.",2015
An energetic criterion for a micro-crack of finite length initiated in orthotropic bi-material notches,"The singular stress field at the tip of a bi-material orthotropic notch may cause the initiation of micro-cracks into one of its material part. Assuming the plane elasticity of the anisotropic media, the Lekhnitskii-Eshelby-Stroh formalism is used to express the characteristics of the singular stress field at the notch tip, the auxiliary solution necessary for the calculation of the contour-independent integrals and consequently generalized stress intensity factors. The matched asymptotic expansion analysis is used to evaluate the fracture energy release rate which allows one to assess the potential direction of a crack and establish the fracture criterion based on the theory of the finite fracture mechanics.

Constructing ,"Balancing detonation performance and sensitivity has always been a challenge in the field of energetic materials. Herein, we present the synthesis of 2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-2H,2 ' H-5,5 '-bistetrazole (4) followed by the introduction of C-NO2, resulting in the formation of 2-(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-2H,2 ' H-5,5 '-bistetrazole (5) characterized by low sensitivity, high energy content, and good thermal stability.

The energetic properties of these compounds were studied, and all new compounds had detonation velocities (7384-9111 m s(-1)) higher than trinitrotoluene (TNT). Particularly noteworthy is compound 5b (D-v = 9111 m s(-1), impact sensitivity (IS) = 13 J, friction sensitivity (FS) = 144 N), which exhibits superior detonation velocity and reduced sensitivity compared to Research Department eXplosive (RDX), presenting a promising avenue for the development of novel energetic materials.",2024
Exploring the Inkjet Printing of Functional Materials and their Use in Energetic Systems and Sensing Applications,"With an eye towards applications such as the selective sensing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or micro-scale thrust generation, inkjet printing was explored as a means to selectively deposit functional materials. The work detailed herein explores a series of fundamental steps to gain expertise related to the piezoelectric inkjet printing of functional materials. The successful printing of nanothermite was demonstrated with two unique printing techniques. Furthermore, the integration of this material with an ignition mechanism was shown to create a fully printed igniter-energetic system. These advancements support future work related to the printing of other energetic materials necessary to create tunable reactive systems. This knowledge was then translated into the development of resonant mass sensing devices that are selectively functionalized using inkjet printing. This approach to functionalization allowed for the precise deposition of receptive chemistries on devices resulting in selective, highly-sensitive devices that successfully detected biomarkers secreted after traumatic brain injuries and harmful VOCs. This work implemented oscillator-based sensors to achieve a low-cost, low-power sensor platform with redundant elements. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of these devices were explored using least squares and linear regression modeling.",2019
Automated discovery of influential chemically termolecular reactions in energetic material combustion: A case study for RDX,"Recent studies have indicated that chemically termolecular reactions, mediated by ephemeral collision complexes, have significant impact on the global kinetics of certain combustion systems. This discovery has since prompted the question of which systems are significantly influenced by chemically termolecular reactions and therefore require their consideration in gas-phase phenomenological models. Although a select number of systems have already been investigated, such as flame speed and ignition delay predictions in common hydrocarbon combustion scenarios, the influence of chemically termolecular reactions on the kinetics of energetic materials has not yet been explored. As an initial investigation into energetic materials, we performed a case study for RDX, for which abundant computational and experimental data are available. To aid in assessing the impact of chemically termolecular reactions, for which almost no data are available, this study leverages an automated procedure to identify and estimate rate constants for potential chemically termolecular reactions based exclusively on data available for related reactions. Four detailed kinetics models for RDX have been independently screened for potential chemically termolecular reactions. Model predictions including these chemically termolecular reactions reveal they have significant potential impact on profiles of major species, radicals, and temperature, including the temperature gradient at the burner surface affecting burn rates. The analysis pinpoints similar to 20-40 chemically termolecular reactions, out of the thousands of possibilities, estimated to have the largest impact. These reactions, including many mediated by ephemeral NNH ** and HNO ** complexes, are therefore worthwhile candidates for more accurate quantification via master equation calculations. More generally, just as the importance of including chemically termolecular reactions in hydrocarbon combustion models is becoming recognized, the present results show compelling evidence for the need for their inclusion in energetic material models as well.

A Computer Model to Study the Response of Energetic Materials to a Range of Dynamic Loads,"Over the past decade we developed a model to enable computer simulation of the mechanical and subsequent energetic response of explosives and propellants to mechanical insults such as impacts, perforations, drops, and falls. The model is embedded in computer simulation programs that solve the non-linear, large deformation equations of compressible solid and fluid flow in space and time. It is implemented as a user-defined model, which returns the updated stress tensor and composition that result from the simulation supplied strain tensor change. Although it is multi-phase, in that gas and solid species are present, it is single-velocity, in that the gas does not flow through the porous solid. More than 70 time-dependent variables are made available for additional analyses and plotting. The model encompasses a broad range of possible responses: mechanical damage with no energetic response, and a continuous spectrum of degrees of violence including delayed and prompt detonation. This paper describes the basic workings of the model.",2018

Some Nitrogen Rich Energetic Material Synthesis by Nucleophilic Substitution Reaction from Polynitro Aromatic Compounds,"Y Three new nitrogen-rich energetic compounds, N-(5-chloro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydrazine (1), N-(5-chloro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)guanidine (2) and N-(5-chloro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-4-aminopyrazole (3) prepared by the nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1,3-dichloro-4,6-dinitrobenzene with hydrazine, guanidinium carbonate and 4-aminopyrazole.

Characteristics of the Initiation of Chain and Thermal Explosions of Energetic Materials by Pulsed Laser Radiation,"A comparative experimental and theoretical study of the initiation of silver azide (SA) single crystals and pressed pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)-metal nanoparticles by a neodymium laser pulse is performed. The main differences in the explosive decomposition of the samples are associated with the absence of the induction period and the presence of subthreshold effects in the initiation of PETN-based composites. By contrast, the initiation of SA single crystals always features an induction period, but no subthreshold effects. It is shown that the observed differences in the explosive decomposition are due to the fact that SA single crystals decompose by the chain explosion mechanism, whereas pressed PETN-metal nanoparticles samples, by the thermal explosion mechanism in the micro-hotspot mode. The kinetic parameters of the initiation of the decomposition reaction calculated within the framework of the existing model are consistent with the available experimental data. An experimental criterion for distinguishing between the chain and thermal (in micro-hotspot) mechanisms of the initiation of an explosion under the action of a laser radiation pulse is formulated, according to which the absence of the induction period and a pronounced manifestation of subthreshold effects are indicative of a thermal explosion, whereas the presence of the induction period and the absence of subthreshold effects are characteristic of a chain explosion.",2016
Determination of nitroaromatic and nitramine type energetic materials in synthetic and real mixtures by cyclic voltammetry,"Nitro-explosives contain reducible aromatic -NO2 groups or cyclic >N-NO2 bonds that may undergo reductive cleavage. This work reports the development of a cyclic voltammetric (CV) assay for nitro-aromatics (trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT)) and nitramines (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX)) using a glassy carbon electrode. This determination was first used for these energetic materials by resolving current responses of reduction potentials primarily due to one constituent but partly contributed by other constituents. Calibration curves of current intensity versus concentration were linear in the range of 30-120 mg L-1 for RDX with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10.2 mg L-1, 40-120 mg L-1 for HMX (LOD=11.7 mg L-1), 40-120 mg L-1 for TNT (LOD=11.2 mg L-1), and 40-140 mg L-1 for DNT (LOD=10.8 mg L-1). Results showed that the CV method could provide a sensitive approach for the simultaneous determination of RDX and TNT in synthetic and real mixtures. Deconvolution of current contributions of mixtures at peak potentials of constituents was performed by multiple linear regression. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of military explosives comp A5 and octol, and method validation was performed both against HPLC on a comp B (TNT+RDX) sample and against GC-MS on real post-blast residual samples containing both explosives.

Can the sensitivity of energetic materials be tuned by using hydrogen bonds? Another look at the role of hydrogen bonding in the design of high energetic compounds,"Strongly positive electrostatic potential in the central areas of molecules of energetic materials is one of the most important factors that determines the sensitivity of these molecules towards detonation. Quantum chemical and density functional theory calculations were used to reveal the influence of hydrogen bonding on the values of electrostatic potential above the central areas of molecules of three conventional explosives: 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. Both the case when energetic molecules act as hydrogen atom donors and when they act as hydrogen atom acceptors were considered. Results of the calculations performed using the M06/cc-PVDZ level of theory showed that there are significant differences in the influence of hydrogen bonding on the electrostatic potential of energetic molecules acting as hydrogen atom donors and hydrogen atom acceptors. In the case when energetic molecules act as hydrogen acceptors, an increase of 10% in the strength of positive electrostatic potential was identified. In the case when energetic molecules act as hydrogen atom donors, a significant decrease (20-25%) in the strength of the positive potential on the molecular surface was calculated. These differences give an opportunity for fine-tuning the impact sensitivities of energetic compounds and provide new guidelines for the design of explosives with desirable characteristics.",2021
Thermostable Insensitive Energetic Materials Based on a Triazolopyridine Fused Framework with Alternating Nitro and Amine Groups,"In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of novel triazolopyridine fused-ring compounds with alternating nitro and amine groups. Three compounds showed remarkable thermal stability at 256, 310, and 294 degrees C, respectively, and a low mechanical sensitivity [impact sensitivity (IS) = 40 J, friction sensitivity (FS) = 324 N; IS = 35 J, FS = 240 N; and IS > 40 J, FS = 324 N, respectively]. Significantly, two of these compounds exhibited a better detonation performance [detonation ve-locity (D) = 8200 and 8335 m s(-1), Detonation pressure (P) = 25.6 and 27.2 GPa, respectively] than the widely used heat-resistant explosive hexanitrostilbene (HNS; D = 7612 m s(-1), P = 24.3 GPa). Additionally, a nitramine derivative displayed a detonation performance (D = 8569 m s(-1), P = 31.3 GPa) similar to that of the high-energy explosive RDX. The superior properties of the materials were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis and by several theoretical calculations (ESP, LOL-pi, Hirshfeld surfaces, RDG, and NCI analyses). These results indicated that the three compounds might be potential candidates for use as heat-re-sistant energetic materials.",
Assembling tetrazole-rings on a fused ring framework: toward energetic materials with enhanced performance,"A series of nitrogen-rich fused ring energetic compounds assembled with different numbers of tetrazole rings were achieved by the classic Dimroth rearrangement (DR) reaction. The DFT calculations of the reaction were carried out for the detailed mechanism. All newly prepared energetic compounds were fully characterized, and the key physicochemical properties showed high nitrogen content (60.20-72.04%), high heats of formation (755-1085 kJ mol(-1)), and good stabilities. This work gives the classic Dimroth rearrangement new vitality to access energetic materials and highlights the influence of HEDMs properties by the different numbers of tetrazole rings.",2023
Efficient Synthesis of a Superior Heat-Resistant Energetic Material Based on Fused Pyrazolotriazine Ring,"Fused-ring energetic materials are considered to be promising energetic materials. However, their practical applications are usually hindered due to the tedious synthetic routes. In this work, 4-amino-3,8-dinitropyrazolo-[5,1-c] [1,2,4]triazin-7-ol (4) was easily prepared within three straightforward steps starting from commercially available ethyl cyanoglyoxylate 2-oxime (1). Compound 4 is a promising heat-resistant explosive, with remarkable thermal stability (decomposition temperature 332 degrees C) and thermal sensitivity (burst point 380 degrees C at 5 s). In addition, it demonstrates high density (1.88 g cm(-3)), good detonation velocity (8538 m s(-1)) and low impact and friction sensitivities (IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N). Optimized conditions for the synthesis of 4 have also been investigated, and a scale of 10 g could be prepared over one- batch reaction using the modified synthetic path with a high overall yield (46%). The advanced performance and scalable production of 4 make it a bright prospect for industrial production.",2021
Effect of W on the Impact-Induced Energy Release Behavior of Al-Ni Energetic Structural Materials,"Energetic structural materials (ESMs) are an important class of military materials due to their good structural and energy-releasing characteristics. To improve the damage effect of metal-metal ESMs with good mechanical properties, W was added to the 48Al-52Ni composites, and the effect of W on the impact-induced energy release behaviors was investigated. The results showed that the hot-press process and the addition of W did not change the microstructure and surface state of the constituent particles, leading to a stable onset temperature of the Al-Ni intermetallic reaction in (48Al-52Ni)(100-x)W-x composites. Meanwhile, the decrease in the contact area between Al and Ni in the composites with increased W content resulted in the decrease in reaction heat. During the impact process, the intermetallic reaction of W caused by the Al-Ni intermetallic reaction, as well as the oxidation reaction of Al and Ni caused by the brittle fracture along the weak interface, caused the released energy of (48Al-52Ni)(40)W-60 to reach 2.04 kJ/g.",2021
Microstructure Evolution and Compressive Properties of Multilayered Al/Ni Energetic Structural Materials under Different Strain Rates,"Multilayered Al/Ni energetic structural materials integrating exothermic properties and mechanical properties were prepared by the method of electrodeposition and hot pressing in this research. Then, the uniaxial quasi-static compression and split Hopkinson pressure bar experiments were conducted at strain rates from 10(-4) to 6.5 x 10(3) s(-1) at room temperature. The effects of compression strain rate on the microstructure evolution and the compressive properties of multilayered Al/Ni energetic structural materials were systematically investigated. With increasing quasi-static compression strain rate, the compression strength increased slightly for two kinds of Al/Ni multilayers prepared under different hot pressing time. With the hot pressing process extending to 4 h, the dynamic compression strength of multilayered Al/Ni composites monotonically increased from 494.7 to 564.2 MPa with increasing strain rate. It was shown that Al/Ni energetic structural materials exhibited evident strain hardening and strain rate strengthening. However, when the compression strain rate reached 6500 s(-1), the Al/Ni composite prepared with the hot pressing time of 1 h showed prominent thermal softening. Notwithstanding, it was found that the compression strength of Al/Ni composite prepared at 4 h was evidently higher than that at 1 h, since the second phase reinforcement counteracted the thermal softening. In addition, the critical failure strain presented obviously increasing tendency with the increased compression strain rates.",2020
1-Nitro-2-trinitromethyl substituted imidazoles: a new family of high performance energetic materials,"A new series of 1-nitro-2-trinitromethyl substituted imidazoles were designed and synthesized. All the compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies, elemental analysis (EA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray structure determination of compounds 11-15, 17 and 19 showed that their densities range from 1.59 g cm(-3) to 1.86 g cm(-3) and gave insights into their structural characteristics showing the presence of extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions. Most of these new materials exhibit positive heats of formation (HOF = 145.7-344.8 kJ mol(-1)), acceptable oxygen balances and sensitivity values (IS = 10.4-32.5 J, FS = 85-240 N). Detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) were calculated with EXPLO5 V6.01 based on the calculated HOF and densities indicating that some of these trinitromethyl materials (D = 8688-8764 m s(-1), P = 34.4-35.1 GPa) are comparable to 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX, D = 8795 m s(-1), P = 34.9 GPa). Among the new derivatives, 17 (r = 1.82 g cm(-3), Delta H-f = 145.7 kJ mol(-1), D = 8764 m s(-1), P = 35.1 GPa, IS = 14.5 J, OB = 5.0%) shows potential as a high performance energetic material.",2016
Adsorption behavior of explosive molecules on g-C,"Inspired by the latest achievements of two-dimensional (2D) materials as gas sensors, we have performed abinitio calculations to simulate the interactions between the explosive molecules (RDX, TEX, FOX-7 and TATB) and g-C3N4 surfaces in order to exploit the potential applicability of g-C3N4 as explosive sensor. The adsorption energies and measured distances of g-C3N4/explosive configurations indicate that the TATB molecule interacts strongly with g-C3N4 and produces more number of extra peaks within the Fermi level region. The calculated sensitivity (S) test also demonstrates the superior sensitivity of g-C3N4 towards TATB molecule. Keeping other semiconducting materials like graphene and boron nitride in perspective, our calculations show higher binding energies when explosive molecules are adsorbed on g-C3N4 with appropriate charge transfer, representing better sensitivity for the latter. An increased work function is obtained when planar TATB and FOX-7 molecules are placed on the g-C(3)N(4 )surface. Further, the sensitivity of g-C3N4 for these explosive molecules is interpreted in terms of electronic and optical properties, where the density of states and absorption spectra show marked variations when explosive molecules are adsorbed on g-C3N4 surface. The significant overlap between the interacting atoms of adsorbate and adsorbent in PDOS spectra represents the formation of chemical bonds at the interface region. Our calculations demonstrate the adsorption and reactivity processes that occur at the interface region, being useful to develop and design devices with extreme sensitivity for explosive detection.",2021
"Synthesis and Characterization of Commercial Grade Energetic Materials using Decanted 2,4,6 Tri-nitrotoluene (TNT)","2, 4, 6 Tri-nitrotoluene commonly known as TNT is one of the safest and most widely used energetic material for both military as well as commercial purposes. During Second World War, a huge quantity of TNT was used for filling of various conventional munitions used against adversaries. Resultantly, large numbers of unserviceable munitions were left unused and were either disposed of through conventional disposal techniques such as open burn open detonation, sea dumping, incineration, biological degradation or buried underground without proper disposal. A number of accidents have been reported during disposal of these unserviceable and unwanted munitions. To avoid such a detrimental situation, global efforts were made in the past for re-use of unwanted energetic materials but still a lot more effort is needed in this regard. The present work is aimed at the safe conversion of decanted TNT into commercial grade energetic material which can be utilized for mining, quarrying, underwater blast activities. For this purpose, various materials/ingredients have been used with decanted TNT for the synthesis of newly formed melt cast commercial grade energetic material. This particular sample has further been characterized through Thermo gravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques for the identification of various aspects. Results show that the newly synthesized sample has a clear, compact and smooth morphology with almost negligible numbers of cracks and pores unlike decanted TNT in unserviceable state. This process of synthesis and reutilization is not only safe and economical but also environment friendly.",2017
RECOVERY OF PAPER FIBERS FROM TETRAPAK® PACKAGING: MATERIAL AND ENERGETIC VALORIZATION OF THE REMAINING FRACTION,"In this study, a methodology was developed for the treatment/valorization of all the constituent fractions of TetraPak (R), proposing pyrolysis technology for the recycling of plastic and aluminum fraction, resulting in the recovery process of the paper fibers. In percentage these three elements are distributed approximately as follows: 70% of cardboard (kraft paper), 25% of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and 5% of aluminum foil [1, 2, 3, 4].. It was developed an integrated and innovative methodology that starts with the recovery of the paper fibers, which must reintegrate the production cycle of the packaging company. Followed by the valorization of the remaining fraction, this fraction consists in plastic and aluminum, and is valorized through a pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis process is an irreversible chemical modification of compounds by the action of heat and in the absence of oxygen. This technology are used for energy recovery, which causes thermal degradation of the compounds in anoxic environment, and is therefore considered an environmentally friendly technology and it is considered one of the alternative routes for treatment of waste TetraPak (R) packaging [4]. The pyrolysis tests were carried out in laboratory reactor at different temperatures (between 300 and 500 degrees C). At the end of this process the aluminum was recovered and it was produced a synthesis gas with added value. This produced gas was constituted by CO, H-2, CO2 e CH4 with maximum values recorded of 5000, 3200 e 7.5 ppm e 40%, respectively. The laboratory test were confirmed by the analysis of the thermal behavior by DTA/TGA and it was confirmed that the temperature of 500 degrees C is the most indicated for energetic valorization of the aluminum, paper and plastic fraction.",2015
"Determination of thermal diffusivity, conductivity, and energy release from the internal temperature profiles of energetic materials","A novel data processing technique has been developed to obtain thermal diffusivity, conductivity, and reaction heat release for energetic materials from Sandia Instrumented Thermal Ignition (SITI) experiments heated with a linear ramp temperature boundary condition. The method is based on the equivalence of the temperature responses of: (a) ramped temperature boundary condition with no internal heat generation and (b) uniform heat generation (that is, with a negative value) with constant temperature boundary conditions; which is true regardless of the spatial domain. For the specific case analyzed herein (the SITI apparatus), the midplane temperature profile is well represented by a quadratic expression in the radial coordinate for both ramped boundary temperature and uniform heat generation responses. Internal temperature data from temperature ramped SITI experiments with various pyrotechnics, propellants, and explosives were analyzed. Quadratic fits to the temperature profile data were made and the associated fitting coefficients were converted to yield thermal diffusivity directly. Thermal conductivity was then determined from thermal diffusivity, given knowledge of the material's specific heat capacity and density. Finally, because of the equivalence of the cases (a) and (b) above, their individual contributions to a combined temperature profile can be easily separated, thereby yielding internal heat generation as well. This technique allows for measurements of properties for pressed and powdered materials over a range of densities and temperatures. The technique is demonstrated using pyrotechnic materials (KClO4 and Ti/KClO4), a composite solid propellant (herein referred to as ""Propellant A"", a class 1.3 AP-HTPB-aluminum propellant) and an explosive (PBX 9502).

Linking molecular level chemistry to macroscopic combustion behavior for nano-energetic materials with halogen containing oxides,"Coupling molecular scale reaction kinetics with macroscopic combustion behavior is critical to understanding the influences of intermediate chemistry on energy propagation, yet bridging this multi-scale gap is challenging. This study integrates ab initio quantum chemical calculations and condensed phase density functional theory to elucidate factors contributing to experimentally measured high flame speeds (i.e., >900 m/s) associated with halogen based energetic composites, such as aluminum (Al) and iodine pentoxide (I2O5). Experiments show a direct correlation between apparent activation energy and flame speed suggesting that flame speed is directly influenced by chemical kinetics. Toward this end, the first principle simulations resolve key exothermic surface and intermediate chemistries contributing toward the kinetics that promote high flame speeds. Linking molecular level exothermicity to macroscopic experimental investigations provides insight into the unique role of the alumina oxide shell passivating aluminum particles. In the case of Al reacting with I2O5, the alumina shell promotes exothermic surface chemistries that reduce activation energy and increase flame speed. This finding is in contrast to Al reaction with metal oxides that show the alumina shell does not participate exothermically in the reaction. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",2013
Multiphysic modelling of a microactuator based on the decomposition of an energetic material:: application to microfluidics,"We present the conception of a micro pressure source for microfluidics applications. It consists in 3 main parts: (i) a heating resistance built on a dielectric membrane, (ii) an energetic material which decomposes generating a high volume of biocompatible gas, (iii) an elastomer membrane with high elastic properties. PDMS is chosen as the membrane material for its elastic properties. A bimetallic energetic material composed of Mn and Co is chosen because of the high amount of biocompatible gas liberated from its decomposition [1]. When the actuation is required, the energetic material is heated beyond the ignition temperature to generate a high concentration of gas; the gain in pressure produces the deformation of the elastic membrane. Individual models have been developed for each physical phenomenon: (i) the heating of the resistance by an electro-thermal model, (ii) the gas generation from the decomposition of the energetic material based on an ideal gas model and a mass transfert model and coupled with the elastic membrane deformation with a mechanical deformation model. This paper presents each individual model under COMSOL Multiphysics that has been correlated with experimental results. Then, the implementation of all models into one global model allow us to predict the actuator performance as a function of input electrical signal.",2007
Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Assisted Construction of Planar Tricyclic Structures for Insensitive and Highly Thermostable Energetic Materials,"Safety is fundamental for the practical development and application of energetic materials. Three tricyclic energetic compounds, namely, 1,3-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine (ATDT), 5 '-nitro-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2 ' H-[1,3 '-bi(1,2,4-triazol)]-5-amine (ATNT), and 1-(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine (ATDNP), were effectively synthesized through a simple two-step synthetic route. The introduction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds resulted in excellent molecular planarity for the three new compounds. Additionally, they exhibit regular crystal packing, leading to numerous intermolecular hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions. Benefiting from planar tricyclic structural features, ATDT, ATNT, and ATDNP are insensitive (IS > 60 J, FS = 360 N) when exposed to external stimuli. Furthermore, ATNT (T-d = 361.1 degrees C) and ATDNP (T-d = 317.0 degrees C) exhibit high decomposition temperatures and satisfying detonation performance. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding that produced this planar tricyclic molecular structure serves as a model for the creation of innovative multiple heterocycle energetic materials with excellent stability.",2024
Underwater pressure waves generated by electrical exploding wire ignited energetic materials: Parametric study and formulation optimization,"The combination of electrical wire explosion and low sensitivity energetic materials (EMs) is an efficient and practical method to generate controllable strong pressure waves (PWs), which is receiving extensive attentions in dynamic fracturing related applications. In this paper, the performance of a mud-like EM formulated with aluminum thermite and nitromethane is analyzed experimentally and statistically. Aluminum microparticles (Al MPs) of five different size distributions are tested and the-300 mesh Al MPs is identified as the preferred ad-ditive. In order to establish the mathematical relationship between the EM formulation and the PW parameters, the measured pressure profile is reconstructed based on the ignition mechanism to enable parameter extraction, and a statistical model is then developed with back-propagation neural network and data augmentation. Based on the model, the influence of EM components on the pressure pulse parameters is summarized and optimal formulations are proposed.",2023
The combustion behavior of boron particles by using molecular perovskite energetic materials as high-energy oxidants,"Nonmetal fuel boron (B) had received much attention in the advanced solid propellants. However, the efficient ignition and combustion of B particles still held a huge challenge. In this work, as a typical molecular perovskite energetic material, (H 2 dabco)[NH 4 (ClO 4 ) 3 ] (DAP-4) was introduced as oxidant to design and prepare B-based fuel-oxidant materials, and the ignition and combustion behavior of boron particles by using DAP-4 as high-energy oxidant were studied. The results suggested DAP-4 with high energy property and strong oxidation ability has great potential as high-energy oxidant to be used in B-rich solid propellant systems. By adjusting the B/O ratios of DAP-4/B, the energy-releasing reaction properties of B particles were studied during the thermal decomposition, ignition, and combustion processes. The ignition and combustion reaction mechanism of B with DAP-4 as high-energy oxidant was discussed. Therefore, this work provides a proof-of-principle concept for the design and fabrication of molecular perovskite energetic materials-based B-rich high-energy solid propellants.

Molecular design of prismane-based potential energetic materials with high detonation performance and low impact sensitivity,"To develop new energetic materials, the eleven nitroester substitution derivatives of prismane were investigated at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of density functional theory (DFT). The gas phase heats of formation were calculated by isodesmic reactions and the solid-state heats of formation were obtained by the Politzer approach using the heats of sublimation for the designed compounds. The detonation velocities and pressures of all molecules were calculated by Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on molecular density and heat of detonation. The results show that the nitroester group in prismane is helpful for enhancing molecular detonation properties and power index. Among all molecules, 1,2,3,4-tetrnitroesterprismane has excellent detonation properties (detonation pressure = 40.05 GPa, detonation velocity = 9.28 km/s) and large power index value. The molecular stabilities were evaluated by calculating bond dissociation energies and characteristic heights (H-50). The results indicate that the bond dissociation energies of all molecules are above 80 kJ/mol, and all molecules have a larger H-50 value than hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20, 12 cm). The obtained structure-property relationships may provide basic information for the molecular design of novel high-energy materials. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Prediction of chemical bond breaking in insensitive high-energy energetic materials at high temperature and pressure,"The bond breaking of energetic materials under the action of temperature and pressure has always been a key step in understanding the explosive mechanism of energetic materials. In this work, we use the mean square shift of atoms and the theoretical bond breaking position of chemical bonds to give the bond breaking temperature of each chemical bond of insensitive high-energy energetic materials, 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (a-FOX-7) and 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), at 0 and 30 GPa. The calculation results show that the bond breaking sequence of a-FOX-7 and TATB in the selected pressure range is N-H, N-O, C-NO2, and C-NH2. At the same time, the difference in the sensitivity between a-FOX-7 and TATB was discussed through the analysis of partial chemical bond breaking temperature.",2023
Underwater Shock Wave Generated by Exploding Wire Ignited Energetic Materials and Its Applications in Reservoir Stimulation,"The combination of energetic material (EM) and electrical wire explosion (EWE) is an efficient and economical method to generate strong shock waves (SWs). The idea resembles the exploding bridge-wire (EBW) detonator, but in this case, the EWE operates with much higher electrical energy storage, and the EMs of much lower sensitivity can be directly ignited, which provides a practical compromise among limited energy storage, strong SWs, and safe usage of explosives. The hybrid load based on EWE ignited EMs has been successfully applied for reservoir stimulation in exploitation of both conventional and unconventional oil/gas resources. In this brief review, we summarize the EWE characteristics, SW characteristics, ignition mechanism, and engineering applications of this hybrid load, and give suggestions for future research directions.",2022
Inversely deducing the initiation mechanism of energetic materials under pressure from possible defect states in nitromethane,"In the present research on the sensitivity and initiation mechanism of energetic materials, most attention is focused on the high temperature and molecular vacancy defect states. The nitromethane supercells with various atomic vacancies are investigated under different pressures from 0 to 50 GPa. We find that the oxygen atom is the easiest to deliver from the supercell. The results indicate that the formation of vacancies leads the conductivity for the imperfect crystals. From a series of phenomena in this simplest energetic material with atomic vacancy defects, we deduce a detonation mechanism, which may be suitable for other energetic materials.",2020
Effect of the curvature of the burning surface of condensed energetic materials on the burning rate,"Combustion of homogeneous condensed energetic materials (CEMs) with a curved burning surface is considered within the framework of the phenomenological theory of unsteady combustion. A dependence of the burning rate on the burning surface curvature is found. It is demonstrated that there exists a limiting surface curvature value above which self-sustained combustion is impossible. This limiting curvature depends on thermophysical and ballistic characteristics of CEMs. The existence of the limiting curvature of the burning surface offers an explanation of the critical conditions of combustion of homogeneous CEMs. Based on this hypothesis, the critical diameters of combustion of several homogeneous CEMs are calculated. The calculated results are in good agreement with available experimental data.",2011
Development and Testing of Energetic Materials: The Concept of High Densities Based on the Trinitroethyl Functionality,"The development of new energetic materials is an emerging area of materials chemistry facilitated by a worldwide need to replace materials used at present, due to environmental considerations and safety requirements, while at the same time securing high performance. The development of such materials is complex, owing to the fact that several different and apparently mutually exclusive material properties have to be met in order for a new material to become widely accepted. In turn, understanding the basic principles of structure property relationships is highly desirable, as such an understanding would allow for a more rational design process to yield the desired properties. This article covers the trinltroethyl functionality and its potential for the design of next generation energetic materials, and describes relevant aspects of energetic materials chemistry including theoretical calculations capable of reliably predicting material properties. The synthesis, characterization, energetic properties, and structure property relationships of several new promising compounds displaying excellent material properties are reported with respect to different kinds of application and compared to standard explosives currently used. Based on a review of trinltroethyl-containing compounds available in the literature, as well as this new contribution, it is observed that high density can parerally be obtained in a more targeted manner in energetic materials taking advantage of noncovalent bonding interaction, a prerequisits for the design of next generation energetic materials.",2009
Intramolecular Assembly of Nitrobiazoles and an Ether Bridge: Toward Energetic Materials with Enhanced Energy and Safety,"Recently, the construction of novel fused-ring frameworks has become one of the most significant innovative approaches to access high-energy and thermostable energetic molecules. In this work, an ether bridge was utilized as a building block to construct energetic fused-ring skeletons for the first time. Two new [5,7,5]-tricyclic N-heterocycle-based backbones, ditriazole-1,3,6-oxadiaze-pine and pyrazole-triazole-1,3,6-oxadiazepine, were synthesized via a straightfor-ward one-step synthetic route and the energetic performances of their derivatives were further evaluated. Containing an additional oxygen atom, high-density pyrazole-triazole backbone, and high crystal packing coefficient, the asymmetric molecule 2,10,11-trinitro-5H,7H-pyrazolo[1,5-c][1,2,4]triazolo[5,1-e][1,3,6]-oxadiazepine (NOB-3) features a high crystal density of 1.825 g cm-3, much superior to those of the symmetrical analogues 2,10-dinitro-5H,7H-bis([1,2,4]-triazolo)[1,5-c:5 ',1 '-e][1,3,6]oxadiazepine (NOB-4, d = 1.758 g cm-3) and D (d = 1.634 g cm-3). Meanwhile, the compounds NOB-3 and NOB-4 exhibit better thermal stability than the parent molecule DNBT (Td = 251 degrees C), and their decomposition temperatures reach up to 303 and 294 degrees C, respectively. The remarkable overall performance of NOB-3 and NOB-4 strongly suggests them as appropriate candidates for heat-resistant explosives. Our study may give new insights into the close correlation of the structural properties of energetic fused-ring frameworks, and the universality of the asymmetric heterocycles combination strategy for designing advanced high-energy density materials (HEDMs) was emphasized again.",2022
Length Transferring the available fused cyclic scaffolds for high-throughput combinatorial design of highly energetic materials via database mining,"Recently, the fused cyclic compounds have been the object of an increased interest in the field of energetic materials (EMs) due to the trade-off between energy and safety. Compared with the fused cyclic EMs consisting of the azoles or azines, the oxazole-based fused EMs which possibly possess higher energy-density are very lacking. Here, we proposed an efficient approach to design the highly energetic oxazole-based fused materials. The domain-related knowledge promoted an advanced database search for the aromatic oxazole-based scaffolds from the buyable subset of the ZINC20 database, ensuring scaffolds are available for purchase. Then, 171 target scaffolds were transferred into the EM field and cooperated with combinatorial design to construct a chemical space containing over 10(7) potential energetic molecules. The high-throughput screening was performed in four aspects, namely, density, difficulty of synthesis, detonation performance, and sensitivity, to accelerate the search for candidates. Meanwhile, the statistical analysis through the hierarchical filtrations clarified the potential of 2r-3s and 2r-4s scaffold types for creating highly energetic molecules. Finally, several candidates stood out owing to nearly 10000 m/s detonation velocity and acceptable predicted sensitivity, elucidating the effectiveness of our approach. We anticipate this investigation could not only be a vital point for subsequent fused cyclic EM research, but also offered a new avenue for material design in other fields.",2022
Accurate machine learning models based on small dataset of energetic materials through spatial matrix featurization methods,"A large database is desired for machine learning (ML) technology to make accurate predictions of materials physicochemical properties based on their molecular structure. When a large database is not available, the development of proper featurization method based on physicochemical nature of target proprieties can improve the predictive power of ML models with a smaller database. In this work, we show that two new featurization methods, volume occupation spatial matrix and heat contribution spatial matrix, can improve the accuracy in predicting energetic materials' crystal density (rho(crystal)) and solid phase enthalpy of formation (H-f;solid) using a database containing 451 energetic molecules. Their mean absolute errors are reduced from 0.048 g/cm(3) and 24.67 kcal/mol to 0.035 g/cm(3) and 9.66 kcal/mol, respectively. By leave-one-out-cross-validation, the newly developed ML models can be used to determine the performance of most kinds of energetic materials except cubanes. Our ML models are applied to predict rho(crystal) and H-f,H- solid of CHON-based molecules of the 150 million sized PubChem database, and screened out 56 candidates with competitive detonation performance and reasonable chemical structures. With further improvement in future, spatial matrices have the potential of becoming multifunctional ML simulation tools that could provide even better predictions in wider fields of materials science.

Turn-off Fluorescent Sensing of Energetic Materials using Protonic Acid doped Polyaniline: A Spectrochemical Mechanistic Approach,"The trace detection of energetic materials (EMs) is a challenge due to the very low vapor pressure possessed by these compounds. Polyaniline (PAni) possesses variable oxidation and reduction states, which makes it strike different from other conducting polymers in understanding the mechanism of fluorophore-analyte interaction leads to the designing of selectivity and sensitivity of analytes; also, fluorophore as a sensing device. The present work is aimed at trace detection of some very prominent EMs; nitroarenes viz., 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), trinitrotoluene (TNT); nitramines viz., hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) and nitro ester viz., pentaerithroltetraniterate (PETN) employing para-toluenesulfonic acid as a dopant for PAni nanofibers (P-PAni). The P-PAni helps overcome the dual difficulties of PAni, i.e., solubility and removal of pi stacking when dimethylformamide (DMF) is used as a solvent. P-PAni showed good quenching response and selectivity towards EMs, with the LOD being the best for CL-20 (0.717 mu M center dot L-1). The sensing studies further collaborated with the Cyclic Voltammetry, FTIR and Raman Spectroscopy studies gave a detailed understanding of the bipolaron-polaron transition mechanism accompanying the electron transfer process in the fluorescence quenching study.",2021
Melting Point Prediction of Energetic Materials via Continuous Heating Simulation on Solid-to-Liquid Phase Transition,"Melting point is a significant property of energetic materials especially for melting cast explosives. Theoretical prediction of melting point is greatly meaningful for design and screening of low-melting-point candidates for casting medium. Herein, the melting behavior of nitromethane (NM) at different heating velocities ranging from 1 to 0.02 K/ps was investigated via molecular dynamics simulation of solid-to-liquid phase transition as a case study. Simulation results indicate that stable solid-to-liquid phase transition can occur when the heating velocity is less than or equal to 0.1 K/ps. The melting point of NM was predicted to be around 254 K, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 245 K. In the melting process, the structural transition from ordered arrangement to disordered distribution of NM molecules was observed as a result of the weakening of intermolecular interactions, leading to the decrease of C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. The results reported here shed light on the important influence of heating velocity on accurate estimation of melting point in continuous heating simulations.",2019
Energetic efficiency of laser thermonuclear targets with ablator shells made of beryllium materials: A comparative analysis,"The energetic characteristics of the compression and burning of targets with beryllium and beryllium deuteride shells are compared. The characteristics considered include the hydrodynamic efficiency, the efficiency of energy transmission to the thermonuclear fuel, and the gain factor found from numerical simulation using the 'Diana' one-dimensional mathematical code. The calculations are carried out for direct-drive cryogenic laser targets with the ablator shells made of beryllium or beryllium deuteride with parameters corresponding to the third harmonic of energy of the neodymium-laser radiation with a pulse energy of 1-3 MJ. It is proved that the gain of beryllium hydride targets can be brought to the level of beryllium targets due to variations in the geometrical parameters of BeD2 targets. It is shown that the fission of BeD2 or BeDT ablators in reactor-scale targets could significantly contribute to the final thermonuclear yield.",2007
Synthesis of Danicalipin a Precursors and Cycloaddition Chemistry Towards the Production of Strained and Energetic Materials,"Chapter 1 introduces chlorosulfolipids of freshwater algae. The proposed biosynthesis and biological activities are explored. The focus is primarily shifted to danicalipin A. We discuss its unusual structure and highlight the differences between danicalipin A and the other chlorosulfolipids. The six total syntheses of danicalipin A are summarized. Chapter 2 builds upon the information in chapter 1 and highlights the precursors of danicalipin A. Deschlorodanicalipin A and monochlorodanicalipin A comprise a large portion of Ochromonas danica , but their roles have not been fully elucidated. Chapter 2 focuses on the reason that danicalipin A and its precursor have been largely understudied and the development of total syntheses of both precursors to enable further biological and biophysical experiments. Chapter 3 represents a shift in focus from lipid total syntheses to the synthesis of strained rings, namely fused cylobutane rings. Two unprecedented natural products containing this motif, aplydactone and ladderane phospholipid, are further explored and current synthetic methods for synthesizing fused cylobutane rings are discussed. Cubane is also explored at length despite not being a natural product due to growing interest of this skeleton for a variety of purposes. This chapter focuses specifically on cubane’s use in the energetic materials space. Chapter 4 describes the syntheses of novel energetic materials that utilize one of two forms of energy release. A novel isoxazole based nitroxyethyl nitramine (NENA) is formed on multi-gram scale and tested by our collaborators for their energetic properties. We discuss the purpose of NENAs, the most used members, and why innovation is needed. Fluoroladderene structures are also proposed for energetic materials, in an effort to make use of a less common form of energy release, strain energy. Chapter 5 builds on the discussions of developing strain motifs by proposing a new method for accessing cyclobutadiene. We discuss the setbacks involved with the leading cyclobutadiene equivalent, cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl and present examples for the utility of our alternative, including derivatizations and the first reported total synthesis of dipiperamide G.",2022

"Tunable Dimroth rearrangement of versatile 1,2,3-triazoles towards high-performance energetic materials","A highly efficient strategy of two different types of nitrogen-rich heterocyclic energetic compounds, featuring a single NH-bridge (-NH-) and a fused ring, was demonstrated by virtue of Dimroth rearrangement reactions using 4-amino-5-nitro-1,2,3-triazole as the precursor. Various nitrogen-rich compounds and their salts were prepared via this transformation and fully characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR, elemental analysis, and single crystal X-ray structuring. Their key properties, such as decomposition temperatures, densities, detonation velocities and pressures, and impact sensitivities, were obtained from theoretical calculations or experimental measurements. With different task-specific explosophores, the representative energetic compounds 6b and 18 exhibit great potential as high performance insensitive energetic materials and organic primary explosives, respectively.

A promising cation of 4-aminofurazan-3-carboxylic acid amidrazone in desensitizing energetic materials,"For the development of energetic materials, insensitive compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their improved safety and lower cost than those of sensitive energetic compounds during production, transportation, and application. In this study, insensitive 4-aminofurazan-3-carboxylic acid amidrazone was used as a cation to obtain four derivatives which were determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. It is interesting to note that all four derivatives are insensitive to impact and friction, while the velocities of detonation for derivatives are superior to that of insensitive TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene). Multi-factors analysis shows that the cation of 4-aminofurazan-3-carboxylic acid amidrazone is a promising furazan-based cation in desensitizing energetic compounds.",2020
Gram-Scale Synthesis of Graphene Quantum Dots from Single Carbon Atoms Growth via Energetic Material Deflagration,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with quantum confinement and size effect are proposed to be applicable in photovoltaic, nanodevices, and so on, due to extraordinary electronic and optical properties. Here we report a facile approach to synthesize gram-scale GQDs from active carbon atoms, which are obtained via the deflagration reaction of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Si, growing from high- to low-temperature zones when traveling through the deflagration flame in a short time with releasing gas as the carrier medium. The prepared GQDs were aggregated into carbon nanospheres; thus, Hummer's method was utilized to exfoliate the GQD aggregations into individual GQDs. We show that the length of GQDs is similar to 10 nm and the exfoliated GQDs solution presents an obvious fluorescence effect with a strong emission peak at 570 at 460 nm excitation. And these GQDs are demonstrated to be excellent probes for cellular imaging. Furthermore, we propose a growth mechanism based on computer simulation, which is well verified by experimental reproduction. Our study opens up a promising route for high-yield and high-quality GQDs, as well as other various quantum dots.",2015
Analysis of Conditions for Determining the Thermophysical Characteristics of Energetic Materials by the Laser Pulse Method,"An analysis of conditions for determining the thermophysical characteristics of energetic materials by the laser pulse method is performed. Based on the results of numerical solution of the heat conduction problems for a sample of a material irradiated with a short heating laser pulse corresponding to actual experimental conditions, the time dependences on the sample surface temperature are determined. The heat pulse duration required to determine the thermophysical properties of materials and the ignition delay time are compared. It is shown that the determination of the thermophysical characteristics of a typical energetic material by the laser pulse method is possible at pulse durations of no longer than 0.24 s.",2016
Preparation and properties of NC/RDX/AP nano-composite energetic materials by the sol-gel method,"A new nano-composite energetic material, in which submicrometer ammonium perchlorate (AP) particles and nanoparticles of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) were uniformly dispersed in the cross-linked nitrocellulose (NC), was prepared by the sol-gel method. The structure of the material was confirmed by means of SEM, XRD and N-2 adsorption isotherm techniques, and the results showed that the NC/RDX/AP nano-composite energetic material is monolithic with numerous pores of nanometer scale and the mean grain size of RDX is < 100 nm. The properties of the material were studied by TG/DSC and oxygen bomb calorimetry. TG/DSC analyses indicated that firstly RDX decomposed along with NC matrix and the DSC exothermic peak temperature of NC matrix and RDX is 10 A degrees C lower than that of the physical mixture and secondly the exothermic peak temperature of AP component shifts from the lower temperature of NC matrix and RDX decomposition to the higher temperature of AP decomposition as the AP mass ratio increases. The heat-of-explosion tests showed that the NC/RDX/AP nano-composite energetic materials produced more energy during explosion and the sensitivity of them is lower than that of the physical mixture according to the impact sensitivity test. A new nano-composite energetic material, in which submicrometer ammonium perchlorate (AP) particles and nanoparticles of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) were uniformly dispersed in the cross-linked nitrocellulose (NC), was prepared by the sol-gel method.

Synthesis of one-molecule-thick single-crystalline nanosheets of energetic material for high-sensitive force sensor,"Energetic material is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy, which is extremely sensitive to external stimuli like force. In this work, one-molecule-thick single-crystalline nanosheets of energetic material were synthesized. Very small force applied on the nanosheet proves to lead to the rotation of the tilted nitro groups, and subsequently change of current of the nanosheet. We apply this principle to design high-sensitive force sensor. A theoretical model of force-current dependence was established based on the nanosheets' molecular packing structure model that was well supported with the high resolution XPS, AFM analysis results. An ultra-low-force with range of several picoNewton to several nanoNewton can be measured by determination of corresponding current value.",2012

Preparation and combustion performance of molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4-based composite with Titanium powder,"Micron-sized titanium particles have potential applications as energetic metal high-enthalpy fuel materials. The molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4 (H2dabco)[NH4(ClO4)3] is a potential high-energy oxidizer in solid rocket propellants. To explore the combustion mechanism and energy output of DAP-4-based Ti composites, the combustion characteristics of DAP-4/Ti and F/DAP-4/Ti were studied by electrode ignition device. The results show that the burning rate of DAP-4 can be adjusted by controlling the mass ratio of DAP-4/Ti. After adding Ti into DAP-4, the heat release, self-sustaining combustion time and flame front propagation velocity are greatly increased to 9,113 J g-1, 265 ms and 0.225 mm ms-1, respectively, better than those of DAP-4. With Ti added, the decomposition peak temperature of F/DAP-4/Ti dropped from 381.5 to 360.4 celcius. The experimental results contribute to a better understanding of the chemical reaction mechanism and energy release characteristics of DAP-4-based propellants containing Ti.",
"Rheological kinetics of ferrocenylsilane functionalized polyurethanes based on 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate for advanced energetic materials","4,4 '-Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI) is a symmetric aromatic isocyanate commonly used as a curing agent in the production of polyurethanes (PUs). The chemorheology and kinetics of its reaction with a metallocenic-prepolymer derivative from hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is studied in bulk and under isothermal conditions at 50-80 degrees C by means of rheological measurements. The viscosity of the initial part of the PU formation, the pregel stage governed by viscous behavior, is modeled through the Arrhenius rheokinetic model. This thermoplastic elastomer undergoes gelation, a transition that is analyzed in depth together with predictions according to percolation theory. The gel point (t(gel)) is determined from the intersection in tan delta versus curing time for different shear frequencies. From the viscoelastic properties, like the elastic storage modulus (G'), the conversion degree is determined, and the entire polymerization process is modeled through the Kamal-Sourour and Sato kinetic expressions. Significant variation in the reaction orders and the activation energies might reveal a change in the process mechanism, depending on the temperature. This work demonstrates that an indirect method makes it possible to gain relevant knowledge about the chemistry of these thermoplastic PUs during curing, which is essential for their manufacturing. This study merits attention for the development of a new generation of high-performance binders with great potential in aerospace propulsion.",2022
Comprehensive End-To-End Design of Novel High Energy Density Materials: III. Fused Heterocyclic Energetic Compounds,"In contrast to synthesis and experimental characterization that are usually expensive and time-consuming, a coupled combination of ab initio and group additive theoretical methods represents a powerful alternative to computationally design and characterize new materials with targeted properties. Heterocyclic energetic materials are considered attractive candidates to replace conventional high explosives, such as PETN, RDX, HMX, and TNT. Heterocycles enable an intriguing opportunity for combinatorial design of new classes of energetic materials with targeted performance and sensitivity properties and offer ways for an accurate analysis of structure-property correlations of the materials. By using a computational strategy that links methods of quantum chemistry and semiempirical statistical analysis, we designed, modeled, and characterized a series of novel linear and fused explosive compounds. Proposed materials with best combinations of performance and sensitivity parameters can be now considered as potential candidates for synthesis and experimental characterization.",2019

The material has favorable sensitivity properties; energetic properties point toward its potential as both a melt-castable secondary explosive and as a propellant plasticizer.",2017
On the stability of the self-sustained combustion of energetic materials with intense subsurface heat release,"In modeling the combustion of quasi-homogeneous energetic materials (EMs), much effort is spent on a more accurate description of the processes in the gas phase, an approach implying that the gas phases determine the whole picture of the combustion process. At the same time, the ever growing body of evidence suggests that the processes in the condensed phase play a leading role in the combustion of a number of common EMs at pressures of 40 to 100 atm. In this case, the subsurface reaction zone is unstable. The concepts of this previously unknown type of instability make it possible to plausibly explain the effect of transversal combustion waves, which were experimentally observed for EMs with gaseous product release, including combustion in the Zel'dovich-Novozhilov stability region. Arguments in favor of such waves being of phase character are presented. These conclusions are valid for the Zel'dovich-Novozhilov instability as well. A problem of modeling the combustion of EMs with instability in the subsurface reaction zone was formulated.",2008
Thermolysis and combustion performance of molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4 doped with Al-SnO,"DAP-4(C6H18N3Cl3O12) is a novel molecular perovskite energetic materials compound that is characterized by high energy, high thermal stability and high oxidation stability. The properties of DAP-4 were enhanced by preparing mixtures of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30%SnO2/Al/DAP-4 using the solvent evaporation method. The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The thermal decomposition characteristics of the samples were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry and thermal reconnection techniques. The combustion performance test device was used to comparatively analyze the burning pressure, flame temperature, and heat of combustion of the samples. The optimal preparation ratio was determined, and the thermal decomposition mechanism of the SnO2/Al/DAP-4 mixture was deduced. The findings suggest that: The SnO2 and Al powders can be uniformly mixed with DAP-4, leading to the creation of a SnO2/Al/DAP-4 composite that displays outstanding dispersion properties. At the optimal preparation ratio of 20%SnO2/Al, the activation energy required for the thermal decomposition of SnO2/Al/DAP-4 is the lowest, at 106 kJ mol(-1). This leads to a significant decrease in the peak temperature of the exothermic decomposition of DAP-4. During the combustion process, the addition of 20%SnO2/Al significantly increased the combustion intensity of DAP-4. This resulted in an increase in the combustion pressure up to 1.1 MPa and a rise in the flame temperature up to 3136 degree celsius, releasing more combustion heat compared to the feedstock and other proportions of the SnO2/Al/DAP-4 mixtures.",2024
Temporal scale-bridging of chemistry in a multiscale model: Application to reactivity of an energetic material,"A heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) to evolve chemistry across disparate temporal scales is presented. The method directly couples a particle-based, microscale coarse-grain chemistry model to a macroscale continuum finite element model of deformation. The macroscale model obtains both the material equation-of-state and instantaneous chemical reaction rates through evaluation of the microscale model subject to distinct boundary conditions. The approach is demonstrated through several simulations of the energetic material 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) subject to slow heating, including a simulation inspired by the scaled thermal explosion (STEX) experiment.Published by Elsevier Inc.",2023
Modeling of Gasification of a Solid Porous Energetic Material in a Low-Temperature Aircraft Gas Generator,"This paper presents an improved mathematical model for gasification of a solid porous fuel when hot gases are filtered through it. Gasification modes were studied at a constant pressure drop between the gasifier inlet and outlet and at a constant gas velocity at the gasifier inlet using polymethyl methacrylate as an example. In the case of a constant pressure drop, fuel gasification takes longer and the gas temperature at the outlet increases more slowly than in the case of a constant gas velocity at the inlet under comparable conditions.",2022
Synthesis of Ideal Energetic Materials with High Density and Performance Based on 5-Aminotetrazole,"In this study, a series of energetic compounds featuring intramolecular hydrogen bonds were demonstrated by the substituted reaction with 5-aminotetrazole.

"Nitrogen-Rich Tetrazolo[1,5-","Two metal-free explosives, tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-containing molecules [6-azido-8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-7-amine (3at) and 8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-6,7-diamine (6)], were obtained via straightforward two-step synthetic routes from commercially available reagents. Compound 3at displays an excellent detonation performance (D-v = 8746 m s(-1) and P = 31.5 GPa) that is superior to commercial primary explosives such as lead azide and diazodinitrophenol (DDNP). Compound 6 has superior thermal stability, remarkable insensitivity, and good detonation performance, strongly suggesting it as an acceptable secondary explosive. The initiating ability of compound 3at has been tested by detonating 500 mg of RDX with a surprisingly low minimum primary charge of 40 mg. The extraordinary initiating power surpasses conventional primary explosives, such as commercial DDNP (70 mg) and reported 6-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazine-2-oxide (ICM-103) (60 mg). The outstanding detonation power of 3at contributes to its future prospects as a promising green primary explosive. In addition, the environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 3at effectively shortens the time from laboratory-scale research to practical applications.",2020
"Molecular and Crystal Features of Thermostable Energetic Materials: Guidelines for Architecture of ""Bridged"" Compounds","Extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculation and data analysis on molecular and crystal level features of 60 reported energetic materials (EMs) allowed us to define key descriptors that are characteristics of these compounds' thermostability. We see these descriptors as reminiscent of ""Lipinski's rule of 5"", which revolutionized the design of new orally active pharmaceutical molecules. The proposed descriptors for thermostable EMs are of a type of molecular design, location and type of the weakest bond in the energetic molecule, as well as specific ranges of oxygen balance, crystal packing coefficient, Hirshfeld surface hydrogen bonding, and crystal lattice energy. On this basis, we designed three new thermostable EMs containing bridged, 3,5-dinitropyrazole moieties, HL3, HL7, and HL9, which were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in small-scale field detonation experiments. The best overall performing compound HL7 exhibited an onset decomposition temperature of 341 degrees C and has a density of 1.865 g cm(-3), and the calculated velocity of detonation and maximum detonation pressure were 8517 m s(-1) and 30.6 GPa, respectively. Considering HL7's impressive safety parameters [impact sensitivity (IS) = 22 J; friction sensitivity (FS) = 352; and electrostatic discharge sensitivity (ESD) = 1.05 J] and the results of small-scale field detonation experiments, the proposed guidelines should further promote the rational design of novel thermostable EMs, suitable for deep well drilling, space exploration, and other high-value defense and civil applications.",2020
A study of Al,"In this paper, we investigate the interaction between Al-n (n = 5, 6) cluster and small molecules. Our study shows that the Al cluster promotes the dissociation of the nitro group, while the adsorbed R can lead to the changes in Al core structures. In addition, the fact that Al atom tends to attach to O atom is also observed, if the adsorbed molecules contain O atom. What's more, the introduction of O atom might eventually break the Al-Al bond with the formation of the Al-O-Al bond, and drive the system to a lower energy state. According to the calculated heats of formation, all of the interactions are exothermic processes, except for the interaction between CH2O and Al-5. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014
Unimolecular decomposition of tetrazine-N-oxide based high nitrogen content energetic materials from excited electronic states,"Unimolecular excited electronic state decomposition of novel high nitrogen content energetic molecules, such as 3,3(')-azobis(6-amino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine)-mixed N-oxides (DAATO(3.5)), 3-amino-6-chloro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-2,4-dioxide (ACTO), and 3,6-diamino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-1,4-dioxde (DATO), is investigated. Although these molecules are based on N-oxides of a tetrazine aromatic heterocyclic ring, their decomposition behavior distinctly differs from that of bare tetrazine, in which N-2 and HCN are produced as decomposition products through a concerted dissociation mechanism. NO is observed to be an initial decomposition product from all tetrazine-N-oxide based molecules from their low lying excited electronic states. The NO product from DAATO(3.5) and ACTO is rotationally cold (20 K) and vibrationally hot (1200 K), while the NO product from DATO is rotationally hot (50 K) and vibrationally cold [only the (0-0) vibronic transition of NO is observed]. DAATO(3.5) and ACTO primarily differ from DATO with regard to molecular structure, by the relative position of oxygen atom attachment to the tetrazine ring. Therefore, the relative position of oxygen in tetrazine-N-oxides is proposed to play an important role in their energetic behavior. N2O is ruled out as an intermediate precursor of the NO product observed from all three molecules. Theoretical calculations at CASMP2/CASSCF level of theory predict a ring contraction mechanism for generation of the initial NO product from these molecules. The ring contraction occurs through an (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersection.",2009
Design and Development of a Novel Launch System with Energetic Materials for Unstable Free-Flight Testing,"Characterizing the behavior of highly unstable bodies in flight presents a variety of engineering challenges. Free-flight testing with scale models provides an efficient and economical solution to this problem. This test method requires a means of launching the test model, undamaged, at the desired velocity. The objective of this research was to develop a launch system which incorporates the use of energetic materials for free-flight testing of a model flight vehicle of predetermined mass and dimensions. A high-low pressure gun system was selected for the launcher design, as this system is capable of launching relatively high masses in the velocity range of interest while retaining the necessary reliability and repeatability for useful free-flight testing. This research effort covers the entire process of the design, development, and construction of a novel launch system that makes use of energetic materials for the launch propellant. The energetic material used in this research was double-base smokeless propellant. An analysis of the selected propellant was conducted to determine the relevant physical and chemical properties. These were used in the development of an internal ballistics model created in MATLAB. The purposes of this model were to inform the launcher design process and make predictive velocity estimates for future work. Propellant cartridges specific to this research and procedures for their production were developed and tested. High-speed cameras were utilized for the acquisition of velocity data and also proved useful in observing the dynamics of the launch event during iterations of the launcher design process. The launch system’s potential for use with other data acquisition methods were also investigated. These included infrared motion capture cameras and an in-chamber pressure transducer. The series of test launches conducted with the completed launcher achieved the required velocity for the given mass of the flight model and resulted in a mean velocity within 0.16 m/s of the target velocity with a standard deviation of 1.77 m/s. Further refinement of the internal ballistics model with data from other acquisition systems could provide increased predictive capability, leading to a more efficient response to changes in the mass and required velocity of the flight vehicle model.",2022
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with gold nanorods for the simultaneous quantification of nitramine energetic materials,"In this study, we propose a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based method for the quantification of nitrite (NO2-) derived from the alkaline hydrolysis of explosive materials, octahydro-1,3,5,7- tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). For this purpose, samples were hydrolyzed and neutralized before SERS measurement. The SERS determination of nitrite was performed on the surface of 4-aminothiol-modified gold nanorods doped with silver nanoparticles. Due to the differential hydrolysis behaviour of HMX and RDX at different alkalinities and temperatures, these two nitramines could be separately determined with SERS. Calibration curves were obtained for HMX and RDX by plotting the maximum intensity band at 1286 cm (1) (arising from diazotization of nitrite) versus the concentration of standard solutions. This correlation was found to be linear within the concentration range of 0.25-10 mg L--1,L- and the limit of detection of the method was 0.39 mg L-1 and 0.61 mg L-1 for RDX and HMX, respectively. Both sensitivity and linearity were better than in similar SERS assays. The proposed SERS method was validated against UV-vis colorimetric method, and the effectiveness of the method to quantify HMX and RDX in real soil samples was investigated. This is the first study on the simultaneous quantification of HMX and RDX in synthetic solutions and real samples by SERS. It may also serve to quantify HMX, emerging as a major impurity in commercial grade RDX samples.",2017
"A novel stable high-nitrogen energetic material: 4,4′-azobis(1,2,4-triazole)","A novel high-nitrogen compound with an N, N'-azo linkage, 4,4'-azobis(1,2,4-triazole), has been synthesized and well characterized. The solid-state structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. The experimentally determined density and enthalpy of formation matched with theoretically computed values based on the B3LYP method. The DSC result suggests that 4,4'-azobis(1,2,4-triazole) decomposes at a relatively high temperature (313.36 degrees C). By comparison with 3,3'-azobis(1,2,4-triazole), containing a C, C'-azo linkage, the N, N'-azo linkage was found to provide compounds with a relatively high density and high energy.",2011
"When Energetic Materials, PDMS-Based Elastomers, and Microelectronic Processes Work Together: Fabrication of a Disposable Microactuator","The present article describes the elaboration of a microactuator based on the decomposition of an energetic material. The fabrication of such a pyrotechnic actuator relies on novel smart materials and a simplified process developed through chemistry. The heterometallic Werner complex [Co(NH3)(6)](2)[Mn(NO3)(4)](3) was chosen as an energetic material releasing only biocompatible gases when ignited. It was deposited on a resistance at the bottom of a micrometer scale chamber comprising directly photocurable polydimethylsiloxane walls and a thin elastic membrane as a roof. The membrane also comprised polysiloxanes. One of the key steps consisted of the grafting of siloxane-bearing acrylate moieties onto a standard silicon wafer, similar to those incorporated on the polysiloxane. The grafting was successfully characterized by XPS. Moreover, the walls of the cavity were elaborated by direct photolithography. After deposition of the energetic material, the cavity was sealed thanks to membrane grafting and the process was optimized to afford strong wafer/wall and wall/membrane interfaces in order to withstand the high mechanical stress imposed on the device in use.",2009
Numerical analysis method for the RC and geological structures subjected to extreme loading by energetic materials,"This paper proposes and demonstrates a numerical simulation method suitable to analyze the local damage and dynamic response of the structures composed of the reinforced concrete (RC) and/or the geological materials subjected to extremely severe loading by the energetic material like high explosives (HE). After the description of the numerical simulation method, the former part of this work attests that the present method has an enough accuracy to simulate the dynamic behavior of the RC structures subjected to the impulsive loading, through comparison of numerical analysis results with those of reference experiments. In the latter part of this work, a three-dimensional numerical simulation is performed by using the same analysis code as applied in the former part, but for much more complicated physical system. Through the discussion on the numerical simulation results the effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated from the viewpoint of the explosion safety and the structural integrity evaluation.

Synthesis of Heat-Resistant and Low-Sensitivity Energetic Materials Based on Hydrazine Bridge Linkage,"In this work, a combination of vicinal amino-nitro groups and the hydrazine bridge was developed to synthesize two insensitive and heat-resistant energetic compounds 2,2 '-hydrazo-bis(2-amino-3,5-dinitropyridine) (2) and 2,2 '-hydrazo-bis(4-amino-3,5-dinitropyridine) (4) through a simple method. The structures of compound 2 and 4 were adequately characterized by NMR (H-1 and C-13), elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and infrared spectroscopy. Notably, compound 2 possesses thermal stability (T-d = 350 degrees C) higher than that of 2-bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) ethene (HNS) (T-d = 318 degrees C) and comparable to that of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) (T-d = 350 degrees C). Moreover, compound 2 possess a higher energy level (2: D = 8759 m s(-1), P: 34.1 GPa) than HNS (7612 m s(-1), P: 24.3 GPa) and TATB (8114 m s(-1), P: 31.4 GPa). These consequences indicate that compound 2 has potential applications as an insensitive and heat-resistant explosive.",2023
A thermal compensated model for predicting the internal combustion of energetic materials in a combustion chamber,"Influences of heat losses on the performances of thermal systems driven by internal combustions are unavoidable. Methods to compensate the heat losses are very important for improving the fidelity of numerical predictions. In this paper, a thermal compensated model was put forward for predicting the combustion of energetic materials in a gun propulsion system. Different from the existing models, the heat exchanges between the combustion products and the inner walls of the chamber were considered in the energy conversion equation. The modified two-phase fluid flow model governing the combustion was solved by using a Godunov type of numerical scheme. The exchanged heat was obtained by predicting the transient heat transfer in the barrel based on a finite element method. Based on the modified model and the coupled computational framework, the combustion of energetic materials in a launching process was studied and the influences of the heat losses on the combustion were discussed. The results indicate that the modified model can effectively compensate the heat losses for thermal systems. The work provides an accurate method to compensate heat losses for evaluating the system performances.",2019

Energetic Cs,"In this paper, the authors studied the interaction of 14.5 keV accelerated Cs+ ion interaction with commonly used materials in the microelectronic industry. The motivation of this work was to examine the suitability of cesium as a future ion candidate for focused ion beam (FIB) nanomachining applications, from the beam-surface interaction aspect. Since nanometer scale Cs FIBs are uncommon, the authors have used a relatively broad Cs+ beam for this work. Two irradiation configurations were used: 60 degrees and normal incidence with respect to the sample surface. Two sample types were irradiated, a pristine Si wafer piece and layered sample of tungsten over SiO2 on top of a Si substrate. Post Cs+ irradiation, the samples were capped and carefully prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy inspection. TEM studies of the subsurface damage to the Si shows a regular amorphization process, without odd microstructural changes even for high applied dose. The amorphization depth in Si was found to be smaller than 25 nm and the Cs staining level to be about 10% by atomic densities. A very small amount of Cs was measured within the tungsten and the SiO2 layers, attributed to high diffusion rate of Cs in these materials. The authors believe that a Cs+ ion based source may be used for future nanomachining applications from the beam-surface interaction aspect. However, the high diffusion rates of Cs in the materials tested presents a concern regarding gate oxide contamination and subsequent complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor device degradation.

Energetic electron signatures of Saturn's smaller moons: Evidence of an arc of material at Methone,"We present several energetic charged particle microsignatures of two Lagrange moons, Telesto and Helene, measured by the MIMI/LEMMS instrument. These small moons absorb charged particles but their effects are usually obscured by Tethys and Dione, the two larger saturnian satellites that occupy the same orbits. The scales and structures of these microsignatures are consistent with standard models for electron absorption from asteroid-sized moons in Saturn's radiation belts. In the context of these observations, we also examine the possibility that the 3 km Satellite Methone is responsible for two electron microsignatures detected by Cassini close to this moon's orbit. We infer that a previously undetected arc of material exists at Methone's orbit (R/2006 S5), we speculate how such a structure could form and what its physical characteristics and location could be. The origin of this arc could be linked to a possible presence of a faint ring produced by micrometeoroid impacts on Methone's surface, to E-ring dust clump formation at that distance or to temporary dust clouds produced by enceladian activity that spiral inwards under the effect of non-gravitational forces.

"High-pressure vibrational spectroscopy of energetic materials: Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine","Vibrational spectroscopy has been used to investigate the room-temperature high-pressure phases of the energetic material hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). The pressure-induced alterations in the spectral profiles were studied in a compression sequence to 30.2 GPa using Raman spectroscopy and to 26.6 GPa using far-infrared spectroscopy. At pressures near 4.0 GPa, several changes become immediately apparent in the Raman spectrum, such as large frequency shifts, mode splittings, and intensity changes, which are associated with a phase transition from alpha-RDX to gamma-RDX. Our study extends the kinetic stability of gamma-RDX to pressures near 18.0 GPa. Evidence for a new phase was found at pressures between 17.8 and 18.8 GPa and is based on the appearance of new vibrational bands and associated changes in intensity patterns. The new phase has vibrational characteristics that are similar to those of beta-RDX, suggesting the two polymorphs share a related crystal structure.",2007
Model of UV-curing thickness for new thiol-ene resin for additive manufacturing of energetic materials,"A new type of photocurable resin, which can be used for additive manufacturing of energetic materials, was prepared by modified polyether and multifunctional mercaptan. For the curing progress of this resin in a single layer of digital light processing (DLP), we incorporate micro-dynamical mechanism of free-radical photo polymerizations into the thickness-time equation to show how the curing thickness varies with initiator concentration ([I]) and incident light intensity (I0). We show that the temporal variation of curing thickness depends on two key parameters: the characteristic penetration depth ha = 1/(81[I]+alpha 0), where 81 is the molar extinction coefficients of initiator and alpha 0 is the absorption coefficient of oligomer, and critical time T-c = -ln(1-phi c)/ (kI(0)(0.5)[I](0.5)), where phi c is the gel point of monomer and k is rate constant. Here, we consider the effects of [I] and I0 to the characteristic penetration depth ha and the critical time Tc in the early stage of radical polymerization, which means that the concentration of initiator and monomer could be deemed as constants. As predicted by the model, Tc is a linear function of 1/ I-0(0.5) and 1/[I]0.5. Validation experiments show that the curing thickness predicted by the model is in good agreement with the experimental data. These results can be used for the accurate prediction of parameter setting of 3D printing and the component proportion of resin.",2022
Phase transformation of heat-resistant energetic material BDNAPM studied by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction,"Bis(3,5-dinitro-4-aminopyrazolyl) methane (BDNAPM) is a new insensitive secondary explosive with a high thermal decomposition temperature. The higher thermal stability and insensitivity towards impact and friction make BDNAPM potentially useful in mining and fracking industry. The sensitivity of explosives is correlated to the phonon modes of the material. Pressure and temperature induced phase transformation study of BDNAPM is important for applications because different phases show different detonation properties and sensitivity towards external stimuli. We have calculated the vibrational frequencies of BDNAPM molecule using Gaussian software, phonon frequencies of the crystal using density functional perturbation theory, and assigned the modes. We report the pressure dependent phase transformations in BDNAPM using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Appearance of new modes, especially in the external mode region indicates a structural phase transformation at 3.3 GPa. Also, many internal and external modes show discontinuity above 2.8 GPa. The changes in the bands like splitting, discontinuity and red-shift occur mainly for bands corresponding to the N-H, C-H and N-O movements, indicating change in the hydrogen bonding that could lead to a reorientation of the molecule and a structural phase transformation beginning at 3.3 GPa. Pressure dependent X-ray diffraction results corroborate the Raman spectroscopic results. The crystal lattice exhibits anisotropic compression under pressure. We were able to fit the ambient orthorhombic structure to the XRD patterns up to 2.6 GPa and then the structure transformed into a monoclinic phase (space group P2(1)/n) with a 13% volume reduction. Bulk modulus is obtained by fitting third-order Birch Murnaghan equation of state to the PV data for the ambient and high-pressure phase.",2022
Computational design and screening of promising energetic materials: The coplanar family of novel heterocycle-based explosives,"A series of coplanar compounds based on triazine ring and triazole ring are proposed for the design of new energetic materials. The molecular structure, electronic structure, stability and detonation properties of these 40 compounds have been calculated by the density functional theory method. With the participation of hydroxyl, amino and nitro groups, these nitrogen-rich fused ring compounds have the characteristics of aromaticity and hydrogen bonding. At the same time, the standard molar heat capacity, standard molar entropy and standard molar enthalpy change trends of some representative compounds in the temperature range of 200-800 K were calculated. The detonation performance, stability and density of these coplanar compounds were compared. There are 25 compounds with high density (rho = 1.80-1.94 g center dot cm(-3)), of which A3-2 exhibits excellent detonation performance (rho = 1.93 g center dot cm(-3), D = 8.86 km center dot s(-1), P = 36.27 GPa), it is a potential candidate for high energy density materials. These research results provide a theoretical basis for the future design and screening of new energetic materials.",2021
The role of adhesion and binder stiffness in the impact sensitivity of cast composite energetic materials,"The drop weight impact or drop hammer test has been a staple of energetic material small-scale sensitivity testing for over 100 years, but the link between material properties and sensitivity has proven difficult to evaluate, especially for composite materials. In this study, the work of adhesion and elastic modulus of the binder were varied to assess their impact on the sensitivity of a family of plastic bonded explosive composite energetic materials. Drop weight impact tests performed using the German Bundesanstalt fur Materialprufung impact test demonstrated significant decreases in sensitivity as the elastic modulus and the work of adhesion decrease. It was determined that the elastic modulus of the binder was the most significant contributor to the corresponding changes in sensitivity.",2020
On the detection and classification of material defects in crystalline solids after energetic particle impact simulations,"We present a fingerprint-like method to analyze material defects after energetic particle irradiation by computing a rotation invariant descriptor vector for each atom of a given sample. For ordered solids this new method is easy to use, does not require extreme computational resources, and is largely independent of the sample material and sample temperature. As illustration we applied the method to molecular dynamics simulations of deuterated and pristine tungsten lattices at 300 K using a primary knock-on atom (PKA) of 1 keV with different velocity directions to emulate a neutron bombardment process. The number of W atoms, which are affected after the collision cascade, have been quantified with the presented approach. At first atoms at regular lattice positions as well as common defect types like interstitials and vacancies have been identified using precomputed descriptor vectors. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to identify previously overlooked defect types and to derive the corresponding local atomic structure. A comparison of the irradiation effects for deuterated and pristine tungsten samples revealed that deuterated samples exhibit consistently more defects than pristine ones. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Financial and energetic evaluation of solar-assisted heat pump underfloor heating systems with phase change materials,"The objective of this work is the investigation of various underfloor solar heat pump heating systems with and without phase change materials (PCMs) in the floor layer. More specifically, a building of 100 m(2) floor area in Athens (Greece) is simulated and evaluated during the winter. The analysis is conducted with TRNSYS software and the results are presented in energy and financial terms. Solar collectors such as flat-plate, photovoltaic and thermal-photovoltaic are coupled to a tank which feeds a heat pump for space-heating purposes. In order to increase the storage capacity, a PCM-layer is placed on the underfloor heating system and different cases are examined by changing the thickness of the insulation in the floor and the area of the collectors. Moreover, this study presents the capital, variable and total cost, the electricity consumption, the coefficient of performance, the solar cover and the indoor temperature of the building for all the systems. The results prove that the use of the PCM-layer on the underfloor heating system reduces the heating load about 40% and the variable costs up to 20% because the electricity consumption can be reduced between 42% and 67%. Moreover, a multi-objective procedure was performed in order to evaluate all the scenarios and it is found that the thermal-photovoltaics seem to be the most appropriate cases due to the extremely low grid electricity consumption. The simple payback period of the system with flat plate collectors without PCM has been found 10.2 years and with PCM 18.3 years.",2019
The role of short-ranged energetic correlations in the mobility field dependence of disordered organic materials,"We studied the mobility of charge carriers in a model for disordered organic solids where the energies of the localized states are Gaussianly distributed with short-ranged correlations. We obtained an expression for the mobility as a function of electric field, temperature, energetic variance, and correlation radius. The temperature dependence obtained with short-ranged energetic correlations is different from that obtained with power-law decaying energetic correlations and suggests a possible way to distinguish the two types of correlations from the measured mobility. This work also presents a practical way of computing the mobility, applicable to any transport model based on a linear master equation, directly from the matrix of the hopping rates.

Hydrates of 5-Amino-1,"5-Anlino-1H-tetrazolium halogenide salts (Cl, Br, I) can be Used to synthesize energetic materials by metathesis reactions. Hydrate halide salts of 5-amino-1 H-tetrazole (5-AtHX, X = Cl, Br, 1) were synthesized and characterized by crystal structure determination. A detailed description of their structure is given in this manuscript and the bonding parameters are compared to the calculated Values (MP2 and B3LYP). In addition, the compounds were characterized by using elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13, N-15) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Lastly, attempts to synthesize the fluoride and the energetically interesting azide salts are discussed.",2008
Two Energetic Framework Materials Based on DNM-TNBI as Host Molecule: Effectively Coordinated by Different Cations,"With the demand of develop outstanding-performance energetic materials, 1-(dinitromethyl)-4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-1H,1'H-2,2'-biimidazole (DNM-TNBI) emerged as a great contender (D: 9102 m & sdot; s-1; P: 37.6 GPa). However, the relatively poor thermal stability (Td: 142 degrees C) limits its practical application. In this study, DNM-TNBI as a host molecule to synthesize two new energetic open-framework materials by effectively coordinated with different cations. Their supramolecular structures were investigated and indicated that [DNM-TNBI2-][2NH4+] and [DNM-TNBI2-][2K+] can be classified as a new energetic hydrogen-bonded ammonium framework (EHAF) and an energetic metal organic framework (EMOF). Meanwhile, their thermal stabilities are higher than that of DNM-TNBI and have satisfactory detonation performance ([DNM-TNBI2-][2NH4+], D: 8050 m & sdot; s-1, P: 26.4 GPa; [DNM-TNBI2-][2K+], D: 8301 m & sdot; s-1, P: 30.8 GPa). We successfully started from DNM-TNBI and synthesized two different energetic framework materials by assembled with two different cations, [DNM-TNBI2-][2NH4+] and [DNM-TNBI2-][2K+]. Both of them show better thermal stabilities than DNM-TNBI. At the same time, they have good detonation performance. These encouraging results give an enlightenment to achieve a good balance between energy and stability towards energetic materials.+ image",2024
PARC: Physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural networks to assimilate meso scale reactive mechanics of energetic materials,"The thermo-mechanical response of shock-initiated energetic materials (EMs) is highly influenced by their mi-crostructures, presenting an opportunity to engineer EM microstructures in a ""materials-by-design"" framework. However, the current design practice is limited, as a large ensemble of simulations is required to construct the complex EM structure-property-performance linkages. We present the physics-aware recurrent convolutional (PARC) neural network, a deep learning algorithm capable of learning the mesoscale thermo-mechanics of EM from a modest number of high-resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS). Validation results demonstrat-ed that PARC could predict the themo-mechanical response of shocked EMs with comparable accuracy to DNS but with notably less computation time. The physics-awareness of PARC enhances its modeling capabilities and generalizability, especially when challenged in unseen prediction scenarios. We also demonstrate that visualiz-ing the artificial neurons at PARC can shed light on important aspects of EM thermos-mechanics and provide an additional lens for conceptualizing EM.",2023
"Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Energetic Materials by Design: State of the Art, Challenges, and Future Directions","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a enabling tool for solving complex materials design problems. This paper aims to review recent advances in AI-driven materials-by-design and their applications to energetic materials (EM). Trained with data from numerical simulations and/or physical experiments, AI models can assimilate trends and patterns within the design parameter space, identify optimal material designs (micro-morphologies, combinations of materials in composites, etc.), and point to designs with superior/targeted property and performance metrics. We review approaches focusing on such capabilities with respect to the three main stages of materials-by-design, namely representation learning of microstructure morphology (i. e., shape descriptors), structure-property-performance (S-P-P) linkage estimation, and optimization/design exploration. We leave out ""process"" as much work remains to be done to establish the connectivity between process and structure. We provide a perspective view of these methods in terms of their potential, practicality, and efficacy towards the realization of materials-by-design. Specifically, methods in the literature are evaluated in terms of their capacity to learn from a small/limited number of data, computational complexity, generalizability/scalability to other material species and operating conditions, interpretability of the model predictions, and the burden of supervision/data annotation. Finally, we suggest a few promising future research directions for EM materials-by-design, such as meta-learning, active learning, Bayesian learning, and semi-/weakly-supervised learning, to bridge the gap between machine learning research and EM research.",2023
"Triazene-bridged energetic materials based on nitrotriazole: synthesis, characterization, and laser-ignited combustion performance","Compared to the widely concerned azo bridges (-N=N-), triazene bridges (-N=N-NH-) with longer nitrogen chains are also favorable linking units leading to novel energetic materials. In this work, a new family of nitrogen-rich nitrotriazolate-based energetic compounds with a triazene bridge were syn-thesized and well characterized. The experimental results indicated that most of these new compounds have good thermal stabilities and low sensitivities. Among these, ammonium 5,5""-dinitro-3,3""-triazene-1,2,4-triazolate (3) and potassium 5-nitro-3,3""-triazene-1,2,4-triazolate (7) decomposed at a relatively high temperature (240.6 degrees C for 3 and 286.9 degrees C for 7). The impact sensitivities of the obtained compounds ranged from 15 J to 45 J. They also have relatively high positive heats of formation between 667.5 to 817.3 kJ mol(-1). The calculated detonation pressures (P) were located between 23.7 and 34.8 GPa, and the calculated detonation velocities (D) were between 8011 and 9044 m s(-1). Interestingly, ammonium 5-nitro-3,3""-triazene-1,2,4-triazolate (8) and hydroxylammonium 5-nitro-3,3""-triazene-1,2,4-triazole (10) possessed excellent laser-ignited combustion performance.",2023
Study of thermal sensitivity and thermal explosion violence of energetic materials in the LLNL ODTX system,"Incidents caused by fire and combat operations can heat energetic materials that may lead to thermal explosion and result in structural damage and casualty. Some explosives may thermally explode at fairly low temperatures (<100 degrees C) and the violence from thermal explosion may cause significant damage. Thus it is important to understand the response of energetic materials to thermal insults. The One Dimensional Time to Explosion (ODTX) system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has been used for decades to measure times to explosion, threshold thermal explosion temperature, and determine kinetic parameters of energetic materials. Samples of different configurations (pressed part, powder, paste, and liquid) can be tested in the system. The ODTX testing can also provide useful data for assessing the thermal explosion violence of energetic materials. Recent ODTX experimental data are reported in the paper.",2014
Laser initiation processes in thermite energetic materials using laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry,"The reactive processes that occur during the laser initiation of aluminum/iron(III) oxide metastable intermolecular composites (MIC) have been studied by laser-induced desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The ions observed in the plume from the aluminum show fragments from the ablation of the oxide coating and from the metal core. Ablation of the iron oxide component consists primarily of pure iron species such as [Fe](+) and [Fe(2)](+) and small oxides such as [FeO](+) and [Fe(2)O](+) ions. In smaller quantities, metal oxide clusters that are either oxygen deficient, [Fe(FeO)(x)](+), or oxygen equivalent, [(FeO)(x)](+), are observed. When the thermite composite is initiated, mixed metal species are observed in the plume, which correspond to the aluminum substitution analogues of the iron oxide clusters, specifically, [FeAl(2)O(3)](+), [AlFe(2)O(3)](+), and [AlFe(2)O(3)](+). Notably, the amounts of these mixed metal products that form are inversely proportional to the size of the aluminum particles. This suggests that the decrease in ignition time observed in MIC materials is due to the more facile liberation of reactive metallic aluminum when the particle size is small.",2007
Oxy-bridged bis(1,"Energetic salts based on 4,4'-oxybis[3,3'-(1H-5-tetrazol)]furazan were readily synthesized and fully characterized by NMR (H-1, C-13), IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Bis(guanidinium) (6), bis(aminoguanidinium) (7), bis(diaminoguanidinium) (8) salts and carbonic dihydrazidinium(HBTFOF)(2) (13) were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All the salts exhibit excellent thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures over the range 212-289 degrees C. The densities of the energetic salts ranged between 1.64 and 1.86 g cm(-3). The detonation pressures and velocities were calculated to be between 19.7 and 30.8 GPa and 7266-8624 m s(-1), respectively. Impact sensitivities were found to be in the range 5-36 J. The relationship between salt structure and thermal stability was studied by NBO analysis for compounds 6, 7, and 8.",2012
Optical and Thermodynamic Modeling of the Interaction Between Long-range High-power Laser and Energetic Materials,"This study is essential for advancing our knowledge about the interaction between long-range highpower lasers and energetic materials, with a particular emphasis on understanding the response of a 155mm shell under various surface irradiations, taking into account external factors such as atmospheric disturbances. The analysis addresses known limitations in understanding the use of non-realistic targets and the negligence of ambient conditions. The model employs the three-dimensional level -set method, computer -aided design (CAD) -based target design, and a message -passing interface (MPI) parallelization scheme that enables rapid calculations of the complex chemical reactions of the irradiated high explosives. Important outcomes from interaction modeling include the accurate prediction of the initiation time of ignition, transient pressure, and temperature responses with the location of the initial hot spot within the shell, and the relative magnitude of noise with and without the presence of physical ambient disturbances. The initiation time of combustion was increased by approximately a factor of two with atmospheric disturbance considered, while slower heating of the target resulted in an average temperature rise of approximately 650 K and average pressure increase of approximately 1 GPa compared to the no ambient disturbance condition. The results provide an understanding of the interaction between the high -power laser and energetic target at a long distance in an atmospheric condition.",2024
A Novel Understanding of the Thermal Reaction Behavior and Mechanism of Ni/Al Energetic Structural Materials,"Ni/Al energetic structural materials have attracted much attention due to their high energy release, but understanding their thermal reaction behavior and mechanism in order to guide their practical application is still a challenge. We reported a novel understanding of the thermal reaction behavior and mechanism of Ni/Al energetic structural materials in the inert atmosphere. The reaction kinetic model of Ni/Al energetic structural materials with Ni:Al molar ratios was obtained. The effect of the Ni:Al molar ratios on their thermal reactions was discussed based on the products of a Ni/Al thermal reaction. Moreover, depending on the melting point of Al, the thermal reaction stages were divided into two stages: the hard contact stage and soft contact stage. The liquid Al was adsorbed on the surface of Ni with high contact areas, leading in an aggravated thermal reaction of Ni/Al.",2022
A Duo and a Trio of Triazoles as Very Thermostable and Insensitive Energetic Materials,"The triazole moiety with a high heat of formation and a high nitrogen content has been investigated for decades in combination with other nitrogen-rich heterocyclic rings in the field of energetic materials. A novel strategy for the construction of both thermally stable and mechanically insensitive energetic materials using a multi-aminotriazole system is now described. Using this methodology, two series of energetic materials were created on the basis of a duo of triazoles, 5-amino-3-(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (TT), and a trio of triazoles, 4,5-di(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole (TTT). Their nitrogen-rich salts were also synthesized. Compound TT exhibits an excellent onset decomposition temperature (T-d = 341 degrees C), which is superior to that of the conventional heat-resistant explosive hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (T-d = 318 degrees C). The nitrogen-rich salt 4,S-di(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazolium 3,4,5-trinitropyrazol-1-ide (TTT-1) exhibits both remark- able detonation properties and low sensitivities (D-v = 8715 m S-1; P = 32.6 GPa; IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N), which are superior to those of the traditional explosive LLM-105 (D-v = 8639 m S-1; P = 31.7 GPa; IS = 20 J; FS = 360 N). Therefore, this methodology of building a multi-aminotriazole system could effectively assist in the design of thermally stable and mechanically insensitive energetic materials in future exploration.",2020
Synthesis of New Energetic Materials Based on Furazan Rings and Nitro-,"Energetic compounds1-6, consisting of one or two furazan rings linked by azo or azoxy bridges and one or two nitro-NNO-azoxy substituents, were synthesized by nitration of the correspondingtert-butyl-NNO-azoxy precursors with NO2BF4. Novel methods for the synthesis of 3,4-bis(tert-butyl-NNO-azoxy)furazan (7) and bis-4,4 '-(tert-butyl-NNO-azoxy)-3,3 '-azoxyfurazan (21) were elaborated. The nitro-NNO-azoxy compounds obtained display high calculated detonation performance (v(D)=8.07-9.40 km s(-1)andP(C-J)=27.4-43.4 GPa) that is superior to the corresponding nitrofurazans (DNF, DNAzF, DNAF). The replacement of nitrofurazans with the corresponding (nitro-NNO-azoxy)furazans increases the specific impulse of the model solid composite propellant formulations by 2-10 s, which is due to high calculated heats of formation (600-892 kcal kg(-1)) and positive oxygen balance (0-20 %) of the latter compounds.",2020
"Unsymmetrical Functionalization of Bis-1,2,4-triazoles Skeleton: Exploring for Promising Energetic Materials","Unsymmetrical functionalization of bis- 1,2,4-triazoles was attempted, and a series of nitrogen/oxygen-rich energetic materials were designed and synthesized in this study. Compared with previously reported symmetrical bis-1,2,4-triazole derivatives (iv and v), both unsymmetrically functionalized bis-1,2,4-triazole derivatives (3 and 7) in this work possess improved safety properties (impact sensitivities: 22 J (3) and 11 J (7); friction sensitivities: >360 N (3) and 250 N (7)). Meanwhile, the detonation performance of 3 was apparently improved compared with the C-nitrated compound iv. These features indicate that unsymmetrical functionalization would be a favorable strategy to construct energetic materials with both high energy and safety. Moreover, N-trinitromethyl-functionalized compound 5 possesses high density (1.92 g cm(-3)), positive oxygen balance (+25.1%), and desirable detonation performance similar to HMX, with higher specific impulse (I-sp = 265.1 s) than ADN, suggesting its superiority as a highly energetic oxidizer.",2020
Suspect Screening and Identification of Energetic Materials Using Liquid Chromatography Coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry,"Forensic Scientists need to be able to detect, and confidently identify, any explosive substance encountered during forensic casework. This means flexible analytical methods that provide comprehensive detection of explosives, their precursors, transformation products and related compounds are required. Existing analytical methods typically only target the most commonly encountered explosive substances and often cover relatively small sets of structurally related compounds. Liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is emerging as a viable technique in many fields for screening, identification and quantification of larger numbers of compounds. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the suitability of LC-HRMS for screening and identification of large numbers of known, unknown and suspect energetic materials. An LC-HRMS method was developed and the chromatographic separation and ionisation conditions were optimised for a set of eighteen initial target analytes including nitroaromatics, nitramines, nitrate esters and peroxides. The method performance was then assessed for a larger number of target analytes to investigate the potential for suspect screening and non-target analysis of additional energetic materials without further optimisation. The effect of different identification criteria, such as mass accuracy thresholds, number and type of ions and retention time windows, on selectivity and sensitivity was also examined, to support the selection of evidence-based identification requirements for LC-HRMS analysis of energetic materials. Finally, retention time prediction was investigated for the potential to aid preliminary identification of suspect or non-target energetic materials by prioritising acquisition of reference materials or excluding isomers. Overall, generalisability of a developed LC-HRMS method to a larger set of energetic materials, including MEKP, nitrated sugars and organic gunshot residues, was demonstrated for the first time. This supported the use of full-scan LC-HRMS, for suspect screening and non-target analysis of energetic materials. However, even with high resolution and mass accuracy it was not always possible to unequivocally identify energetic materials using LC-HRMS, due to the presence of hundreds or even thousands of isomers in some cases. In-source fragment ions and the use of ion ratios, increased selectivity but at a cost of sensitivity. The LC-HRMS method was successfully applied to the detection of explosives in contact traces and on passive vapour samplers. The retention time prediction models and prediction intervals presented in this thesis showed promise for adding value to suspect or non-target screening of energetic materials. Following a critical evaluation of the use of LC-HRMS, alone and in combination with other techniques, good chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometry are recommended for confirmatory analysis, along with a consideration of the number of isomers for individual compounds. Due to compromises in selectivity or sensitivity, identification criteria will likely differ for screening versus confirmatory analysis.",2019
The Chemical Compatibility and Adhesion of Energetic Materials with Several Polymers and Binders: An Experimental Study,"The chemical compatibility and the adhesion of energetic materials and additive materials exert a strong influence on the sensitivity, safety and performance of a polymer-bonded explosive (PBX). In this study, the chemical compatibility of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) with several polymers were evaluated using the vacuum stability test (VST) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); while the adhesion between RDX or PETN and each binder based on these polymers was determined through interfacial characteristics using contact angle measurement. The experimental results demonstrate that RDX and PETN are compatible with polystyrene (PS), nitrocellulose (NC) and fluoroelastomer (FKM) according to the STANAG 4147. Therefore the two polymers can be used as adhesives in PBX composition. Moreover, based on interfacial characteristics such as interfacial tension and work of adhesion, the adhesion between RDX and each binder was predicted to be better than that of PETN.",2018
"Electrochemically initiated degradation of a new energetic material 2,2-didnitroethene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7)","The recently synthesized energetic material 2,2-dinitroethene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7) is interesting not only as an explosive, but also as a molecule with multiple redox centers, where strong electron donors (amino groups) and acceptors (nitro groups) are close to each other. The present fundamental electrochemical study revealed that in aqueous solutions the reduction pathway during the exhaustive electrolysis does not follow the expected pattern but after the first electron transfer a chain of spontaneous intramolecular (eventually intermolecular) redox processes takes place leading not to reduction products, but to a total degradation of the title compound. Since evolution of gaseous products has been detected during the electrolysis, the electrochemically initiated decomposition of the FOX-7 seems to be analogous to the explosion process slowed down by the very low concentration and cooled by the solution.",2011
One-Pot Synthesis of Interpenetrating Inorganic/Organic Networks of CuO/Resorcinol-Formaldehyde Aerogels: Nanostructured Energetic Materials,"For many applications ranging from catalysis to sensors to energetic materials, it is desirable to produce intimate mixtures of nanoparticles. For instance, to improve the reaction rates of energetic materials, the oxidizing agent and the fuel need to be mixed as intimately as possible, ideally at the nanoscopic level. In this context, the acidity of a hydrated CuCl, solution reacting toward a network of CuO nanoparticles (a good oxidant) is used to induce one-pot cogelation of a nanostructured network of a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin (RF, the fuel). The resulting wet gets are dried to aerogels, and upon pyrolysis under Ar, the interpenetrating CuO/RF network undergoes a smelting reaction toward metallic Cu. Upon ignition in the open air, pure RF aerogels do not burn, while CuO/RF composites, even with substoichiometric CuO, sustain combustion, burning completely leaving only a solid residue of CuO whose role then has been that of a redox mediator through the smelting reaction.",2009
Theoretical study of potential energetic material CL-20/DNAN eutectic explosive based on molecular dynamics method,"ContextThe exploration of CL-20 eutectic has been a subject of fervent interest within the realm of high-energy material modification. Through the utilization of density functional and molecular dynamics methods, an investigation into the characteristics of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20)/2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) within the molar ratio range of 9:1-1:9 was conducted. This inquiry encompassed the scrutiny of molecular interaction pathway, attachment force, initiating molecular distance, unified energy concentration, and physical characteristics. Furthermore, EXPLO-5 was harnessed to prognosticate the explosion features and byproducts of unadulterated CL-20, DNAN, and CL-20/DNAN frameworks. The findings delineate a substantial differentiation in the electrostatic charge distribution on the surface between CL-20 and DNAN particles, signifying the preeminence of intermolecular interactions between disparate entities over those within similar entities, thus intimating the plausibility of eutectic constitution. Remarkably, the identification of maximal attachment force at a molar ratio of 4:6 suggests the heightened likelihood of eutectic formation, propelled primarily by electrostatic and van der Waals forces. The resultant eutectic explosive evinces intermediate reactivity and exemplary mechanical attributes. Moreover, the detonation achievement of the eutectic with a molar proportion of 4:6 straddles that of CL-20 and DNAN, representing a new type of insensitive high-energy material.MethodsThe testing method employs the Materials Studio software and utilizes the molecular dynamics (MD) method to predict the properties of CL-20/DNAN co-crystals with different ratios and crystal faces. The MD simulation time step is set to 1 fs, and the total MD simulation time is 2 ns. An isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble is used for the 2-ns MD simulation. The COMPASS force field is employed, with the temperature set to 295 K. The prediction of detonation characteristics and products is conducted using the EXPLO-5 software.",2024
Safety verification of femtosecond laser cutting of tungsten alloys during the dismantling of decommissioned energetic materials,"How to safely separate explosives, propellants, detonators and other energetic materials from the large number of decommissioned munitions scheduled to be retired has always been challenging. In this work, we proposed a femtosecond laser to cut metal shells of discarded ammunition and verify the safety of laser irradiation of energetic materials. First, triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), octogen (HMX) and the metal shell of 95 tungsten were irradiated by the single-point laser to explore the ablation properties of the materials. Then, the effect of femtosecond laser cutting speed on the surface groove morphology of energetic materials and 95 tungsten was discussed. The laser-induced damage threshold and peak power density of the TATB, HMX and 95 W were determined. Besides, we adopted the pump-probe ultrafast imaging technique to reveal the ultrafast dynamic responses of metal shells and explosives irradiated by femtosecond lasers. Further, based on the high-speed imaging system, ultrafast dynamic images of the interface between the metal shell and the explosive ablated by femtosecond lasers were obtained, which provided an intuitive insight into the phase characteristics of the ablation region and the scale and intensity of the shock wave caused by the ejection.",2023
Determination of kinetic parameters of exothermic condensed phase reaction using the energetic material ignition delay data,"The kinetic parameters of condensed phase global reaction are required to calculate temporal and energetic characteristics of the ignition and combustion of energetic materials (EMs). The heating rate of EM in these processes exceeds 1000 K/s and therefore the kinetic data obtained via using classical thermal analysis methods with heating rate of 1-50 K/min may not provide the processes adequate description. A solution to the problem was suggested more than 50 years ago by Merzhanov who noticed a possibility to determine required kinetic parameters from the EM experimental ignition delays. However, mathematical background and justification for this approach has not been performed. It is commonly assumed that the approach yields the true kinetics at high heating rates of EMs. The present work aims to verify the validity of Merzhanov's approach. Numerical calculations were performed using transient mathematical models of the EM ignition and the results of virtual ignition experiments were processed using Merzhanov's ignition criterion. The deliverables were the values of kinetic parameters that substantially differ from those used as input data in numerical calculations. The paper concludes about necessity of elaborating mathematically substantiated techniques for determining kinetic parameters of global exothermic condensed-phase reaction via using the EM ignition delays.

Metal-Free Hexagonal Perovskite High-Energetic Materials with NH,"Designing and synthesizing more advanced high-energetic materials for practical use via a simple synthetic route are two of the most important issues for the development of energetic materials. Through an elaborate design and rationally selected molecular components, two new metal-free hexagonal perovskite compounds, which are named as DAP-6 and DAP-7 with a general formula of (H(2)dabco)B(ClO4)(3) (H(2)dabco(2+) = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium), were fabricated via an easily scaled-up synthetic route using NH3OH+ and NH2NH3+ as B-site cations, respectively. Compared with their NH4+ analog ((H(2)dabco)(NH4)(ClO4)(3); DAP-4), which has a cubic perovskite structure, DAP-6 and DAP-7 have higher crystal densities and enthalpies of formation, thus exhibiting higher calculated detonation performances. Specifically, DAP-7 has an ultrahigh thermal stability (decomposition temperatures (T-d) = 375.3 degrees C), a high detonation velocity (D = 8.883 km.s(-1)), and a high detonation pressure (P = 35.8 GPa); therefore, it exhibits potential as a heat-resistant explosive. Similarly, DAP-6 has a high thermal stability (T-d = 245.9 degrees C) and excellent detonation performance (D = 9.123 km.s(-1), P = 38.1 GPa). Nevertheless, it also possesses a remarkably high detonation heat (Q = 6.35 kJ.g(-1)) and specific impulse (Isp = 265.3 s), which is superior to that of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20; Q = 6.23 kJ.g(-1), Isp = 264.8 s). Thus, DAP-6 can serve as a promising high-performance energetic material for practical use. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Influence of Silicon on the Detonation Performance of Energetic Materials from First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"The development of new generation energetic materials (EMs) with improved detonation performance is of considerable importance for applications in civilian and military fields, but there is no clear understanding about how the specific atom type and molecular structure control detonating properties. To gain an atomistic-level understanding of the influence of Si element on the detonation properties of EMs, we carried out the RxMD(cQM) procedure, combining ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics molecular dynamics, to predict the thermodynamics parameters of the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state as measurements of detonation performance. We find that the detonation temperature for tetrakis(nitratomethyl)silane (Si-PETN) is higher than that for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) because of high energy release while forming Si products. However, lower detonation pressure and detonation velocity for the Si-PETN system than those for PETN system were found because Si atoms attract nearby oxygen atoms from other molecules or fragments resulting in cluster products and leading to less gas product formation. Our results indicate that silicon-based energetic materials remain active in oxygen deficient conditions. This study uncovers how the specific atoms influence the detonation properties of EMs from the atomic perspective, providing useful information for designing EMs with improved properties.",2018
A novel method to synthesize stable nitrogen-rich polynitrobenzenes with -stacking for high-energy-density energetic materials,"Two nitrogen-rich energetic compounds with -stacking, 1,1-dichloro-2,2,3,3,6,6-hexanitro-5,5-dihydroxyazobenzene (1) and 8-(2,4,6-triazido-3,5-dinitrophenyl)-8H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5:5,6]benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c]bis([1,2,5]oxadiazole) 1,4-dioxide (2), were prepared by a novel synthesis method, and their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The decomposition temperature of 1 is 336 degrees C and 2 exhibits excellent heat of formation of 1160.5 kJ mol(-1) (2.21 kJ g(-1)). The condensation reaction of the coupling of a N?N bond and an azido from 1 to 2 was proved to be an efficient method to synthesize benzotriazole. This synthetic strategy for benzotriazole may arouse considerable interest in the area of organic synthesis.",2018
Thermal stability and formation barrier of a high-energetic material N,"We report the density functional theory total energy calculations of thermal stability and formation barrier of polymer nitrogen confined in carbon nanotubes (CNT). The analysis suggests that N-8 polymer nitrogen encapsulated in (5,5) carbon nanotube [N-8@CNT(5,5)] is thermally (meta)stable at a finite temperature up to energy scale of at least 5000 K, similar to nitrogen molecule gas phase confined in CNT [N-2@CNT(5,5)]. The energetic difference between these two phases of N does not significantly change with temperature. A barrier of 1.07 eV was found for the formation of N-8@CNT(5,5) from N-2@CNT(5,5), while the dissociation barrier was found to be 0.2 eV. Snapshots of the reaction pathway show that the transition state is composed by a N-2 and a N-6 inside a CNT(5,5).",2009
"Theoretical insight into different energetic groups on the performance of energetic materials 2,5,7,9-tetranitro-2,5,7,9-tetraazabicyclo[4,3,0]nonane-8-one","ContextEnergetic materials are a class of materials containing explosive groups or containing oxidants and combustibles. The optimization of energetic materials has a significant impact on the development of industry and national defense. For high-energy density compounds (HEDC) that have not been synthesized or are dangerous to experimental operation, it is of guiding significance to predict its energy level, physicochemical properties, and safety through molecular design and theoretical calculation. Cyclic urea nitramine series compounds are a type of energetic compounds with high density and excellent detonation performance. In this study, 2,5,7,9-tetranitro-2,5,7,9-tetraazabicyclo[4,3,0]nonane-8-one (K-56) was used as the parent structure, and 36 energetic derivatives were designed. The effects of introducing single and multiple substituents on the electronic structure, energy gap, heat of formation, detonation performance, thermal stability, thermodynamic parameters, and surface electrostatic potential of K-56 and its derivatives were discussed in detail. The results exhibit the following: (1) the single substitution of -C(NO2)(3) (A6) can reduce the detonation velocity of K-56 by 11.9 % and the detonation pressure by 19.8 %, while the double substitution of -C(NO2)(3) (B6) can increase the density of K-56 by 11.6 %, the detonation velocity by 10.9 %, and the detonation pressure by 31 %. (2) The heat of formation of K-56 (-110.0 kJ mol(-1)) increased by 324.18 % and 628.81 %, respectively, proving that -N-3 is an extremely effective group to improve HOF. (3) The thermal stability of the derivatives generated by the monosubstitution of the target group on the six-membered ring is better than that of the parent compound.MethodsGaussian16 and Multiwfn 3.8 packages are the software for calculation. In this study, the parent structure K-56 and its derivatives were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level to obtain the zero point energy and thermal correction data of all compounds. Then the vibration analysis of the optimized structure is carried out to confirm that its configuration is stable. Then the M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP basis set is used to calculate the single point energy.",2023
"Accurate thermochemical properties for energetic materials applications. II. Heats of formation of imidazolium-, 1,2,4-triazolium-, and tetrazolium-based energetic salts from isodesmic and lattice energy calculations","A computational approach to the prediction of the heats of formation (Delta H-f degrees's) of solid-state energetic salts from electronic structure and volume-based thermodynamics (VBT) calculations is described. The method uses as its starting point reliable Delta H-f degrees's for energetic precursor molecules and ions. The Delta H-f degrees's of more complex energetics species such as substituted imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, and tetrazole molecules and ions containing amino, azido, and nitro (including methyl) substituents are calculated using an isodesmic approach at the MP2/complete basis set level. On the basis of comparisons to experimental data for neutral analogues, this isodesmic approach is accurate to < 3 kcal/mol for the predicted cation and anion Delta H-f degrees's. The Delta H-f degrees's of the energetic salts in the solid state are derived from lattice energy (U-L) calculations using a VBT approach. Improved values for the alpha and beta parameters of 19.9 (kcal nm)/mol and 37.6 kcal/mol for the U-L equation were obtained on the basis of comparisons to experimental U-L's for a series of 23 salts containing ammonium, alkylammonium, and hydrazinium cations. The total volumes are adjusted to account for differences between predicted and experimental total volumes due to different shapes of the ions (flat vs spherical). The predicted Delta H-f degrees's of the energetic salts are estimated to have error bars of 6-7 kcal/mol, on the basis of comparisons to established experimental Delta H-f degrees's of a subset of the salts studied. Energetic salts with the highest positive Delta H-f degrees's are predicted for azido-containing cations, coupled with heterocyclic anions containing nitro substituents. The substitution of functional groups on carbon versus nitrogen atoms of the heterocyclic cations has interesting stabilization and destabilization effects, respectively.",2007
"Promising Thermally Stable Energetic Materials with the Combination of Pyrazole-1,3,4-Oxadiazole and Pyrazole-1,2,4-Triazole Backbones: Facile Synthesis and Energetic Performance","Thermally stable energetic materials have broad applications in the deep mining, oil and natural exploration, and aerospace industries. The quest for thermally stable (heat-resistant) energetic materials with high energy output and low sensitivity has fascinated many researchers worldwide. In this study, two different series of thermally stable energetic materials and salts based on pyrazole-oxadiazole and pyrazole-triazole (3-23) with different explosophoric groups have been synthesized in a simple and straightforward manner. All the newly synthesized compounds were fully characterized by IR, ESI-MS, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The structures of 3, 7, and 22 were supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The density, heat of formation, and energetic properties (detonation velocity and detonation pressure) of all the compounds range between 1.75 and 1.94 g cm(-3), 0.73 to 2.44 kJ g(-1), 7689 to 9139 m s(-1), and 23.3 to 31.5 GPa, respectively. All the compounds are insensitive to impact (>30 J) and friction (>360 N). In addition, compounds 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 21, 22, and 23 show high onset decomposition temperature (T-d between 238 and 397 degrees C) than the benchmark energetic materials RDX (T-d = 210 degrees C), HMX (279 degrees C), and thermally stable HNS (318 degrees C). It is noteworthy that the pyrazole-oxadiazole and pyrazole- triazole backbones greatly influence their physicochemical and energetic properties. Overall, this study offers a perspective on insensitive and thermally stable nitrogen-rich materials and explores the relationship between the structure and performance.",2022
Combustion behavior and mechanism of molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4-based composites with metal fuel Al,"Combined with the oxidizer anions and fuel cations, molecular perovskite energetic materials show a good potential. In this work, the combustion behavior and mechanism of metal fuel aluminium (Al) with molecular perovskite energetic material (H2dabco)[NH4(ClO4)3] (DAP-4) as a high-energy oxidant was investigated. The DAP-4 based composites with metal fuel Al were designed and fabricated by the different mass ratios. Results showed that DAP-4 exhibits a good oxygen-supplied capacity for enhancing the combustion performance of Al. The maximum combustion heat of DAP-4/Al-3 at the Al/O mass ratio of 38:62 is up to 10,412 J/g in the inert gas, which is higher than those of other ratios and the mixtures of other energetic materials and Al. The evolution of pressure output, pressurization rate, and Hame temperature was monitored for DAP-4/Al with different mass ratios. Composites DAP-4/Al/F were characterized by burning rates. The combustion reaction mechanism of metal fuel Al with DAP-4 as a highenergy oxidant was provided. DAP-4 was ignited firstly and released acid and oxidizing gases, which corroded Al2O3 shells on Al particle surfaces and accelerated the combustion reaction with Al to release a lot of energy. This work offered a new idea that molecular perovskite energetic materials have great potential in the high-energy Al-based solid rocket propellants. (c) 2022 China Ordnance Society.

High-Pressure Neutron Powder Diffraction Study of ε-CL-20: A Gentler Way to Study Energetic Materials,"High-pressure studies have been performed on the e-form of the powerful explosive CL-20. Hydrostatic compression over the pressure range 0-12 GPa has been monitored using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. The potential effects of X-ray radiation damage were observed and circumvented through a follow-up compression study over the pressure range 0-7 GPa using neutron powder diffraction. This second study revealed smooth compression behavior, and the absence of any phase transitions. Intermolecular interaction energies as obtained using PIXEL calculations did not show any discontinuity upon the application of pressure. An isothermal equation of state has been determined, and the high-pressure response is supported by dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations. In- elastic neutron scattering (experimental and simulated) spectra for the epsilon-form are in excellent agreement.",2020
The influence of energy content and its outputs on the impact sensitivity of high-nitrogen energetic materials,"On 15 high nitrogen and three polynitrated polyazaarenes (including six azido-derivatives), the paper demonstrates the relations between their impact sensitivities (E-dr) on the one hand and the volume heats (rho Q(max)) or a representative of detonation pressure (rho D-2) of their explosion or their enthalpies of formation (Delta H-form) on the other. The semi-logarithmic subrelations between theE(dr)and rho Q(max)values are limited by the mechanism of primary fission. While the mentioned relations betweenE(dr)and rho Q(max)values for azido derivatives predominantly show the expected course, in the case of the remaining high-nitrogen EMs, the opposite is the case, i.e., an increase in rho Q(max)values corresponds to a decrease in impact sensitivity. The same is valid for rho D(2)values as an independent variable. Taking the energy content of the studied EM molecules, represented by Delta H(form)values, instead of the heat of explosion, yields unambiguous semilogarithmic relations, according to which the growth of the Delta H(form)values increases impact sensitivity. The results obtained indicate that it is necessary to distinguish between the influences of the performance and the energetic content of high-nitrogen energetic materials on their initiation reactivity.",2022
Modeling the shock-induced multiple reactions in a random bed of metallic granules in an energetic material,"An investigation of shock-particle interactions in reactive flows is performed using an Eulerian hydrodynamic method with a hybrid particle level-set algorithm to handle the material interface dynamics. The analysis is focused on the meso- to macro-scale numerical modeling of a granular metalized explosive containing randomly distributed metal particles intended to enhance its blast effect. The reactive flow model is used for the cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX) component, while thermally induced deflagration kinetics describes the aerobic reaction of the metal particles. The complex interfacial algorithm, which uses aligned level sets to track deforming surface between multi materials and to generate the random shape of granule elements, is described for aluminized and copperized RDX. Then, the shock-induced collapse of metal particles embedded in the condensed phase domain of a high explosive is simulated. Both aluminized and copperized RDX are shown to detonate with a shock wave followed by the burning of the metal particles. The energy release and the afterburning behavior behind the detonating shock wave successfully identified the precursor that gave rise to the development of deflagration of the metal particles.

"1,2,4-Oxadiazole-Bridged Polynitropyrazole Energetic Materials with Enhanced Thermal Stability and Low Sensitivity","A family of mono or di(1,2,4-oxadiazole)-bridged polynitropyrazole derivatives with C-nitro/N-nitro functionalities is reported. All compounds were fully characterized by IR, NMR (H-1, C-13), elemental analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The solid-state structure features were further investigated with X-ray diffraction. Of these, compounds 3,5-bis(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole (3 a) and 5,5 '-bis(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3,3 '-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole) (3 b) possess high thermal stability (3 a: T-dec=274 degrees C; 3 b: T-dec=272 degrees C), sensitivity (IS >30 J, FS >360 N) and comparable detonation properties (3 a: D-v=8741 m s(-1), P=34.0 GPa; 3 b: D-v=8685 m s(-1), P=33.4 Gpa) to RDX. In addition, 3,5-bis(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole (4 a) and 5,5 '-bis(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3,3 '-bi(1,2,4-oxadiazole) (4 b) have high decomposition temperature (4 a: T-dec=314 degrees C; 4 b: T-dec=317 degrees C), low sensitivity (IS >40 J; FS>360 N) and superior detonation performances (4 a: D-v=8027 m s(-1), P=26.4 GPa; 4 b: D-v=7991 m s(-1), P=25.2 Gpa) than conventional heat-resistant explosive hexanitrostilbene (HNS: T-dec=318 degrees C; IS=5 J; FS=240 N; D-v=7612 m s(-1), P=24.3 GPa), thus suggesting their potential application as heat-resistant explosives.",2019
Co-crystallisation of energetic materials: a step-change in the control of properties and performance of munitions,"The research described in this thesis seeks to explore a concept that has the potential to make a step-change for the control of the properties of energetic materials (sensitivity, long-term storage, processability, performance, etc.), resulting in safer munitions with enhanced performance. This concept is co-crystallisation and involves crystallisation of the energetic material with one or more molecular components in order to modify the properties of the composition. The concept has been demonstrated in the pharmaceutical sector as a successful means of altering the physical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients, e.g. solubility, bioavailability, stability to humidity. This project therefore aims to exploit the concepts of crystal engineering and co-crystallisation as applied to selected energetic materials in order to achieve the following objectives: (i) develop an enhanced understanding of how structure influences key properties such as sensitivity, (ii) control the sensitivity of existing, approved energetic materials, and (iii) identify new energetic materials with enhanced properties, e.g. reduced sensitivity, higher performance, and increased thermal stability. The compound 3,5-nitrotriazolone (NTO) was crystallised with a selection of co-formers to produce salts and co-crystals. The structure properties of these materials were explored using single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, and structural features were correlated with properties such as crystal density, difference in pKa of co-formers, thermal properties, and sensitivity to impact. Detonation velocities of the co-crystals were calculated based on densities, chemical composition, and heats of formation. Co-former molecules included a series of substituted anilines, substituted pyridines (including 4,4’-bipyridine, 2-pyridone), and substituted triazoles. A co-crystal was formed between NTO and 4,4’-bipyridine on crystallisation from ethanol, whilst a salt was formed when crystallised from water. Upon heating the salt to 50ºC, the co-crystal was formed. Structural differences between the salts formed by NTO with 3,5-DAT and 3,4- DAT were correlated with structural features. 3,5-DAT.NTO is substantially less impact sensitive than 3,4-DAT.NTO, and this is attributed to the layered structure of 3,5-DAT.NTO. An investigation into triazole-based NTO salts under high pressure was conducted. A new polymorph of 3,5-DAT.NTO was discovered upon increasing the pressure to 2.89 GPa. The high-pressure phase appears to retain the layered structure and remains in this phase up to 5.33 GPa, although it was not recoverable upon decompression to atmospheric pressure. The compression behaviour of the unit cell volume for phase I of 3,5-DAT.NTO has been fitted to a 3rd-order Birch- Murnaghan equation of state (EoS) with V0 = 957.7 Å3, B0 = 8.2 GPa and B’0 = 14.7. The unit cell was found to be most compressible in the a and c directions. Under high pressure 3,4-DAT.NTO does not give any indication of a phase change occurring up to 6.08 GPa. The coefficients of the 3rd-order Birch-Murnaghan EoS have been determined to be V0 = 915.9 Å3, B0 = 12.6 GPa and B’0 = 6.5.",2017
"Economic and environmental assessment on the energetic valorization of organic material for a municipality in Quebec, Canada","Waste-to-energy provides a solution to two problems: waste management and energy generation. An integrated anaerobic waste valorization process is an interesting option, but because of investments cost and low energy value in the province of Quebec, it is hard for a municipality to commit to that solution. This paper investigated the economic possibilities to manage organic material, organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and municipal wastewater sludge by anaerobic digestion for a 150,000 inhabitant municipality, with consideration to energy generation and greenhouse gas emission reduction. Using the biogas to co-generation solution brings a payback time on investment (PBT) of 3.7 years with electricity price at 0.10 $Cdn/kW h. The addition of manure from surrounding farms increases the biogas production by 37%, but increases the PBT to 6.8 years unless the leftover digestate can be used for agronomic valorization: then it becomes economically advantageous. The natural gas purchasing cost is too low to promote the enrichment of biogas into renewable natural gas. However, this scenario has the lowest energetic payback time (3.3 years) and reduces the most greenhouse gas emissions (4261 tCO(2)eq/a). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010
Polyamino-Substituted Guanyl-Triazole Dinitramide Salts with Extensive Hydrogen Bonding: Synthesis and Properties as New Energetic Materials,"A series of new energetic salts based on the polyamino-1-guanyl-triazole cation with three to five amino groups and the dinitramide anion were synthesized. These new nitrogen-rich salts tend to have extensive hydrogen bonding and exhibit high densities and thermal stabilities. The impact of multiple amino groups in the cation of the dinitramide salts was investigated. Their properties were modified by varying the guanyl substituents and/or the amino substituents on the triazole ring. On the basis of theoretical calculations, 3,5-diamino-1-uanyl-1,2,4-triazole dinitramide, 8, has higher detonation pressure and velocity values than the dinitramide energetic materials such as ammonium dinitramide (ADN), and N-guanylureadinitramide (FOX-12).

Accelerating the search of CHONF-containing highly energetic materials by combinatorial library design and high-throughput screening,"An advanced approach of combinatorial library design and high-throughput screening was developed to accelerate the search of CHONF-containing energetic materials with higher energy density than the current level. The combinatorial library was constructed with a large chemical space (similar to 10(5) molecules) via the fragment-based design, and four criteria, namely, oxygen-fluorine balance, detonation velocity, the drop weight impact height h(50), and the synthesis difficulty, were proposed to achieve the high-throughput screening. About two thousand target molecules with some promising properties comparable to CL-20 were discovered primarily, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach was further verified by DFT calculations. Two of the top ten screened molecules have high detonation velocities approaching 9900 m/s. Besides, the relationship between structural fragments and properties was revealed based on the statistical analysis of a large number of molecules, showing the importance of featural fragments on promoting detonation performance. Hopefully, the exploration herein could enlighten new insight into the fast discovery of novel high-energy-density materials.",2022

A study on the isothermal decomposition kinetics of energetic cellulose-rich materials using a vacuum stability test,"In this work, the isothermal decomposition kinetics of a promising high-energy dense nitrated cellulose carbamate (NCC) was investigated, for the first time, using vacuum stability test (VST) at different isothermal temperatures. The kinetic triplet of NCC was calculated by model-fitting and model-free methods, and compared to that of the conventional nitrocellulose (NC). VST results showed that the gas pressure of the studied energetic cellulose-rich materials (NCC and NC) increased with the increase in time test, which is found more pronounced for NCC compared to NC. Furthermore, thermo-kinetic findings demonstrated that the Arrhenius parameters determined by the two performed kinetic approaches are in good concordance. Indeed, the apparent activation energy of NCC is found to be around 141 kJ/mol, which is lower than that of the common NC (E alpha = 152 kJ/mol). The model-fitting approach revealed that the mechanism of isothermal decomposition of NCC and NC is controlled by a chemical process. Besides, a strong linear relationship between the activation energy and the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor is observed. This work provides valuable guidance for the isothermal decomposition kinetics of energetic cellulose-rich materials and further supports and complements their kinetic database.",
Effect of micron-sized zirconium powder on combustion decomposition behavior of molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4,"Micron-sized zirconium (& mu;Zr) is a viable alternative fuel source for high-energy propellants.

Fine structure of the electrostatic energetic disorder at the interface between disordered organic material and metal electrode,"The physics of organic disordered materials is dominated by the effects of energetic disorder. We show that image forces reduce the electrostatic component of the total energetic disorder near an interface with a metal electrode. Typically, the standard deviation of energetic disorder is dramatically reduced at the first few layers of organic semiconductor molecules adjacent to the metal electrode and correlation properties of the disorder are different from the bulk properties. This means that the use of bulk disorder parameters (such as standard deviation of disorder) for description of the energetic disorder at the interface is poorly justified even in the case of identical spatial and chemical structure of the organic material at the interface and in the bulk of the transport layer. Implications for charge injection into organic semiconductors are discussed. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",2008
"Improved synthesis of an energetic material, 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine exploiting 1-azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane","Expeditious synthesis of 1-nitroso-3-nitroazetidine (6), a useful key intermediate for the synthesis of 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (4), was investigated by using 1-azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (3) and NaNO2 in the presence of some acids. The most efficient method was achieved in 26% yield by treatment of 3 with NaNO2 in the presence of H2SO4 Conversion of 6 into 4 was also carried out.",2000
Influence of Composition on Energetic Properties of Copper Oxide - Aluminum Powder Nanothermite Materials Formed by Electrophoretic Deposition,"We investigated the reactions in composite thermite layers consisting of Al, CuO, and Cu2O nanoparticles formed by electrophoretic deposition on a titanium substrate. The composition determined the reaction propagation rates and heat effects in oxygen and oxygen-free atmospheres. It was found that a stable self-propagating exothermic reaction in the aluminum-copper oxide layer takes place in the range of 50-80 wt.% of Al. The maximum values of the measured heat effects also fell in this range. At the same time, the calculation following the stoichiometry of the reaction shows the optimal range of the Al amount is 10-20 wt.%. To explain this fact, we proposed a model based on calculating the probability of contact between Al and CuO particles depending on the average particle size and their concentration. The model is based on the calculation of solid angles, which means that the exact value of the contact area does not play a decisive role in this case.",2022
"An Improved Synthesis of the Insensitive Energetic Material 3-Amino-5-Nitro-1,2,4-triazole (ANTA)","This work shows the ability of a readily-available oxidizer to achieve the selective oxidation of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (DAT) to 3-amino-5-nitro-1,2,4-triazole (ANTA) in high yields. This strategy reduces the synthesis of this important energetic material and synthon down to a single step. Analysis was conducted on the product and confirmed that the product was indeed ANTA. The yield, safety, and economics of this process are all superior to the current state-of-the-art two-step multi-pot procedure.",2020
Aminonitro Groups Surrounding a Fused Pyrazolotriazine Ring: A Superior Thermally Stable and Insensitive Energetic Material,"Nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds offer promising potential backbones for constructing various high energy density compounds. Selective diazotization of 3,5-diamino-4-nitropyrazole (1) with tent-butyl nitrite followed by treatment with the sodium salt of nitroacetonitrile gives rise to a fused pyrazolotriazine ring (5) surrounded by amino and nitro groups. Compound 5, confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, has a remarkable thermal decomposition temperature of 355 degrees C, a high density of 1.90 g cm(-3), and low impact and friction sensitivities. The detonation performance is also superior to TATB. These advantages make 5 a promising candidate as a heat-resistant explosive.",2019
Computational design and screening of promising energetic materials: Novel azobis(tetrazoles) with ten catenated nitrogen atoms chain,"Density functional theory methods were used to study on 2 N10 compounds, 1,1'-azobis(tetrazole) and 1,1'-azobis(5-methyltetrazole). We systematically investigated 10 novel substituted azobis(tetrazoles) with 10 catenated nitrogen atoms and various energetic groups (-CF(3)1, -C(NO2)(3) 3, -N-3 5, -NH2 6, -NHNH2 7, -NHNO2 8, -NO2 9, -OCH3 10, -OH 11, -ONO(2)12). The optimized geometry, frontier molecular orbitals, electrostatic potential, Infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum were calculated for inspecting the molecular structure and stability as well as chemical reactivity. The effects of different substituents on the density, enthalpy of formation, heat of explosion, detonation velocity and pressure, and sensitivity of the azobis(tetrazole) derivatives have been investigated. Compound 9 with nitro was found to have remarkable detonation performances (D=9.61km/s, P=42.14GPa), which are close to the excellent explosive CL-20. Results show that compounds 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12 have high potential to replace RDX. It is surprising that compounds 1, 3, 9, and 12 possess better energetic properties than HMX. These novel substituted azobis(tetrazoles) with unique N10 structure may be promising candidates of HEDMs with outstanding performance and acceptable sensitivities.",2017
Initial Thermal Response of Micro/Nano-Al particle Embedded in Energetic Materials Excited by Single-Pulse Laser,"The incorporation of Al particles into explosive formulations has been a subject of ongoing interest because the Al particles can increase the energy content of explosives and tailor the energy release rate. The initial thermal response of micro/nano-spherical Al particles embedded in energetic materials excited by single-pulse laser is investigated by several models, which is crucial for understanding and controlling the thermal ignition mechanism of energetic materials. The thermal relaxation dynamics of electron and lattice in Al particle excited by short pulse (ps) laser are described by the two-temperature model. The characteristics of thermal diffusion of micro/nano-Al particle to the particle environment are analyzed using Fourier law for the long pulse (ns) laser. The influences of laser energy and pulse duration on the thermal response are also examined. The results show that, the thermal diffusion is very important for nano-Al particle during the pulse passage. It can cause the rise of temperature of surrounding energetic materials and thus form the ""hot spot"" with high temperature and large scale. That can shorten the time of ignition and enlarge the region of ignition. The laser energy and pulse duration are determined to effectively regulate the temperature and size of ""hot spot"" caused by the nano-Al particles, and the concrete relationships among them are obtained. These results are expected to be a useful indication for adjusting laser ignition (initiation) properties of aluminized explosives by selecting suitable parameters such as particle size, laser pulse duration or laser energy in experiment and practical application.",2015
Theoretical prediction of heats of sublimation of energetic materials using pseudo-atomic orbital density functional theory calculations,"We present a predictive model for the heats of sublimation of the condensed phases of energetic materials that combine the empirical relations of Politzer with first-principles density-functional calculations of the electronic properties of the molecular surfaces. The distinct features of our methodology are the use of numerical pseudo-atomic orbitals for the quantum mechanical calculation of the electronic charge density, as well as an improved technique for the molecular surface area determination. As applications, we used our model to predict heats of sublimation of energetic molecules CL-20, HMX, RDX, TNT, FOX-7, TATB, and LLM-105, with the Politzer parameters fit based on a set of eight nitro-aromatic molecules. In comparison with conventional quantum chemistry calculations, our approach is tremendously less computationally demanding, yet it still demonstrates competitive accuracy and predictive power.",2007
"Natural Lime-Cork Mortar for the Seismic and Energetic Retrofit of Infill Walls: Design, Materials, and Method","Recent seismic events have prompted research into innovative and sustainable materials for strengthening and repairing obsolete and vulnerable buildings. These earthquakes have exposed the high seismic vulnerability of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, particularly in secondary structural elements like infill walls. In addition to structural issues, these buildings often face significant energy deficiencies, such as thermal bridges, due to inadequate insulation. Traditionally, structural and energy improvements for residential buildings are addressed separately with different methods and protocols. This preliminary study is part of a broader research initiative at the University of Reggio Calabria (Italy), aiming to design an innovative fiber-reinforced plaster using natural, sustainable, and locally produced materials to enhance the energy and structural performance of existing wall infills. The study investigates two plaster matrices made of natural hydraulic lime and silica sand, with 15% and 30% cork granules added. Mechanical and thermophysical tests on multiple specimens were conducted to evaluate their suitability for seismic and energy retrofitting of infill walls. Results indicate that adding cork reduces mechanical strength by approximately 42% at a 30% cork content without compromising its use in seismic retrofitting. Thermophysical tests show improved thermal performance with a higher cork content. These findings suggest that the lime-cork mixture at 30% is effective, offering excellent ductility and serving as a promising alternative to traditional cementitious plaster systems. The next experimental phase will test matrices with varying percentages of gorse fiber.",2024
Assembling of energetic and biocidal moieties via C-N cross coupling reactions for gas-driven biocidal materials,"Public health crises often involve bacterial and viral infections, requiring biocidal materials to stop their transmission. Current liquid biocides, such as bleach or alcohol, have low efficiency and portability. In this work, we present a class of gas-driven biocidal materials that release great workable gas and biocide upon decomposition, reaching hard-to-access areas and killing various bacteria. Two series of compounds (Series A: 1-3; Series B: 4-6) were synthesized by assembling of highly energetic moieties with effective biocidal moieties via one-step C-N cross-coupling reactions. Their structures were unambiguous confirmed using analytical techniques, and their biocidal performances were tested in a custom chamber that mimicked challenging sterilization scenarios, such as interior roof, tubes and occluded regions. The decomposition of 30 mg of the as-synthesized compounds killed common bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans) in different scenarios within 5 s with a > 99.9 % kill rate, much higher than that achieved by chlorine-containing biocide. This study shows the remarkable potential of gas-driven biocidal materials for quick and portable biocides in public health.",2024
"4,4′-Azobis(1,2,4-triazole): A Versatile Molecular Scaffold to Develop Tailor-Made Energetic Materials","Energetic materials containing azoles are appealing in terms of their high nitrogen content and presence of functional groups that can participate in different non-covalent bonding interactions. One such interesting compound is 4,4 '-azobis(1,2,4-triazole) (ATRZ), which has formidable energetic parameters. Based on the presence of hydrogen-bond acceptor and metal coordination sites, a number of tailor-made energetic materials have been derived by employing ATRZ as the molecular precursor. In this review, we discuss the use of this high-energy molecular scaffold in the development of different energetic cocrystals, coordination polymers, and composites and discuss their properties in the context of state-of-the-art energetic materials.",2023
Design and preparation of AP/M(5-ATZ),"Intermolecular energetic materials (IEMs) have become the focus of attention due to their excellent performance in combustion, ignition, energy release and sensitivity. In this paper, two IEMs were successfully designed and prepared by the self-assembly of 5-aminotetrazole (5-ATZ) and transition metal ions on the surface of ammonium perchlorate (AP) particles. The scanning electron microscope, infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analyses, and differential thermal analyses were employed to characterize the prepared samples. The results show that the surface of AP particles is completely covered by a uniform and dense M(5-ATZ)(4)Cl-2 (M = Cu, Co) self-assembled layer. Thermal analyses show that the high-temperature decomposition peak temperatures of AP/Cu(5-ATZ)(4)Cl-2 (10 wt%) and AP/Co(5-ATZ)(4)Cl-2 (10 wt%) are decreased by 93.3 C and 127.1 C compared to the case of pure AP, while the heat releases of them are increased by 539 J & BULL;g(-1) and 580 J & BULL;g(-1). In addition, the burning rates of AP/Cu(5-ATZ)(4)Cl-2/Al (10 wt%) and AP/Co(5-ATZ)(4)Cl-2/Al (10 wt%) are increased by 6.8 mm & BULL;s(-1) and 7.8 mm & BULL;s(-1) compared with the case of AP/Al. Moreover, the hygroscopicity tests show that the prepared samples do not agglomerate aftter being placed in the atmosphere with a relative hu-midity of 79% for 66 h. This research shows considerable application prospects in improving the combustion and energy performance of solid propellants, it is also a reference for the design and preparation of other novel IEMs.",2022
"Design and properties of N,N'-linked bis-1,2,4-triazoles compounds as promising energetic materials","N,N'-linked bis-1,2,4-trizaoles compounds substituted with different groups such as -NH2, -NO2, -NHNO2, -OH and -CH(NO2)(2) were designed and studied by density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-311+G(2df, 2p) level. The calculated results of heats of detonation, detonation velocities, detonation pressures, bond dissociation energy and impact sensitivity (h(50)) indicated that -NO2, -NHNO2 and -CH(NO2)(2) groups play an important role in elevating the detonation performances of designed compounds, and -NO2 group play an important role in elevating the thermal stability of designed compounds, and the designed compounds with -NO2 and -NHNO2 groups were less sensitivity than that of -CH(NO2)(2) group. The calculated detonation performances, thermal stability and impact sensitivity of designed compounds were compared with those of some classical explosives such as 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX). The computed results show that 3,5,3'-trinitro-4,4'-bis-1,2,4-triazoles (B3) possess higher detonation performances and thermal stability than that of RDX, but more sensitivity than that of RDX; 3,5,3',5'-tetradinitromethyl-4,4'-bis-1,2,4-triazoles (E4) possess higher detonation performances than that of RDX, but lower thermal stability and more sensitivity than that of RDX; 3,5,3',5'-tetranitro-4,4'-bis-1,2,4-triazoles (B4) possess higher detonation performances and thermal stability than that of HMX, but more sensitivity than that of HMX; 3,5,3',5'-tetranitramine-4,4'-bis-1,2,4-triazoles (C4) possess higher detonation performances than that of HMX, and similar sensitivity to HMX, but lower thermal stability than that of and HMX.",2020
Spectroscopic Approaches for Forensic Problems Identification of Pre-Blast Explosive Residues and Energetic Materials by Raman Spectroscopy,"This thesis reports the application of confocal Raman microscopy to the detection and identification of trace amounts of organic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT); hexogen (RDX); penthrite (PETN); and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD)), inorganic explosives (ammonal (AlAN); black powder; chloratite; and flash powder), and oxidizing salts (ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, barium nitrate, potassium chlorate, sodium chlorate, and potassium perchlorate) trapped between the fibres of dyed and undyed synthetic and natural textile clothing fabrics. Raman spectra were obtained from the explosive/oxidizing salt particles by in situ and on-field analysis using the Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope, and a portable BWTEK i-Raman pro system attached to an optic microscope, respectively, both with the standard instrument components (with no instrument modifications). Analysis were made within 3 to 40 s given particle dimensions as small as 2 µm (oxidizing salts), 3 µm (organic explosives), and 6 µm (inorganic explosives) for the Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope, and 7 (oxidizing salts), 7 µm (organic explosives), and 18 µm (inorganic explosives) for the portable BWTEK i-Raman pro. The results show that, despite the contribution of the textile fabric in terms of fluorescence and vibrational bands coming from the fibres and dyes, detection and identification of the explosive/oxidizing salt particles trapped on highly interfering surfaces was possible. Furthermore, by doing a statistic and chemometric analysis of the Raman spectra and particle size data, discrimination of the textile fabrics was made. In addition, a second study was made in which identification and detection of the potassium nitrate mixed with ten different interfering substances (that act as fuels in homemade explosives), was possible using both the Raman instruments. Esta tese descreve a aplicação de microscopia Raman confocal para a deteção e identificação de quantidades vestigiais de explosivos orgânicos (trinitrotolueno (TNT), hexogeno (RDX), pentrita (PETN), e hexametileno-triperóxido-diamina (HMTD)), explosivos inorgânicos ( “ammonal” (AlAN), pólvora negra, “chloratite” , e pólvora “flash” ), e sais oxidantes (nitrato de amónio, nitrato de potássio, nitrato de sódio, nitrato de bário, clorato de potássio, clorato de sódio, e perclorato de potássio) presos entre as fibras de tecidos naturais e sintéticos, tingidos ou não. Os espectros Raman foram obtidos a partir das partículas dos explosivos/sais oxidantes por análise “in situ” (ou seja, dentro do laboratório) usando o instrumento “Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope” , e por análise imitando situações reais (ou seja, fora do laboratório) usando um Raman portátil ( “portable BWTEK iRaman pro” ) acoplado a um microscópio ótico, usados com os parâmetros instrumentais de origem (sem modificações). As análises tiveram como duração entre 3 - 40 segundos, permitindo obter dimensões de partículas de 2 µm (sais oxidantes), 3 µm (explosivos orgânicos), e 6 µm (explosivos inorgânicos) para o “Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope”, e entre 7 µm (sais oxidantes), 7 µm (explosivos orgânicos), e 18 µm (explosivos inorgânicos) para o instrumento de Raman portátil. Os resultados demonstram que, apesar da contribuição dos tecidos em termos de fluorescência e bandas Raman provenientes das próprias fibras e corantes, foi possível detetar e identificar as partículas de sais oxidantes/explosivos presos nessas superfícies de alta interferência. Além disso, realizou-se uma análise estatística e de quimiometria dos espectros Raman e dados das dimensões das partículas detetadas, que permitiu uma discriminação dos tecidos. No segundo estudo realizado, a identificação e deteção de nitrato de potássio misturado com dez diferentes substâncias interferentes (que atuam como combustíveis em explosivos caseiros) foi possível usando ambos os instrumentos Raman.",2017
Fast deflagration to detonation transition of energetic material based on a quasi-core/shell structured nanothermite composite,"Nanothermites (also called metastable intermolecular composites), composed of nanoscale metals and metal oxides, have drawn increasing interests as energetic materials over the past two decades. Nanothermites have twice the energy density of 2,4,6-trinitroluene, and their nanostructures, functions, energy release, and reaction performance are continuously being improved. However, these materials suffer from low pressure because of low gas expansion from the reaction and incapability of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). Fast DDT is necessary to substantially improve the reaction velocity and output pressure not only of nanothermites but also of other monomolecular organic energetic materials, such as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and octogen. Accordingly, this study aims to produce energetic composites material that are safe, green, and free from heavy metals. A strategy of rapid DDT acceleration is proposed by fabricating quasi-core/shell structured materials of RDX@Fe2O3-Al based on Fe2O3-Al nanothermites. A surface modifying and ultrasonic synthesis technology is also demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations prove that the material comprises an RDX core and an Fe2O3-Al nanothermite shell. Results of closed vessel combustion tests show that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al combustion velocity accelerates to an average pressurization rate of 2.527 MPahls. DDT tube tests further confirm that DDT accelerates to a primer explosive level in which the run-to-detonation distances of DDT is below the test-condition limitation (<15 mm). Sensitivity tests also reveal that the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite has low sensitivity to impact, friction, and electric spark. Therefore, the RDX@Fe2O3-Al composite with a quasi-core/shell structure is a potential green and safe fast DDT energetic material that is easy to synthesize and applicable to other quasi-core/shell structures.

 High-Pressure Studies of Energetic Materials by Vibrational Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction,"Nitrogen-rich materials have been considered as the most promising replacement of traditional energetic materials due to the large energy gap between the different nitrogen allotropes as well as the generation of environmental friendly nitrogen gas as the end-product. As a result, methods of synthesizing the nitrogen-rich materials have received increasing attention. Apart from the traditional chemical synthesis, high-pressure technique had been proved an effective tool to create such kinds of materials. However, several issues still existed concerning the high-pressure synthesis of energetic materials. Therefore, searching for precursors is of great interest. Here we report studies of four promising precursors, 5-aminotetrazole, 5-methyltetrazole, 5, 5´-bis(2-methyltetrazolyl)amine monohydrate and cyanuric triazide, under high pressure by Raman and IR spectroscopy, among which 5, 5´-bis(2-methyltetrazolyl)amine monohydrate and cyanuric triazide were also studied using X-ray diffraction. Besides, the high-pressure behavior of s-triazine was also investigated to have an in-depth understanding of the properties of cyanuric triazide. In chapter 2, 5-aminotetrazole and 5-methyltetrazole were investigated and compared to examine the pressure effects on the ring structures and the high-pressure behaviors. No phase transitions for 5-aminotetrazole were found in the whole pressure range. However, four phase transitions were observed for 5-methyltetrazole, evidenced by the by the appearance of new lattice modes, the changes in peak profile as well as the pressure dependence of Raman lattice modes over different pressure ranges. Upon decompression, the tetrazole ring vibration modes in both compounds were fully recovered, suggesting the high stability of the tetrazole ring. The Raman and IR spectroscopic data together allowed for the analysis of the possible reasons of the stability of the tetrazole ring. In chapter 3, another tetrazole derivative, 5, 5´-bis(2-methyltetrazolyl)amine monohydrate, was investigated by vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Raman and IR spectroscopic data together with the XRD patterns collectively suggested there were no phase transitions in the entire investigated pressure range. Several changes were observed during compression and possible mechanisms were proposed. Upon decompression, all the Raman and IR modes were completely recovered, indicating the reversibility and good stability of this material. Chapter 4 focuses on the high-pressure studies of two six-member aromatic rings, s-triazine and cyanuric triazide. A total of four phase transitions for s-triazine were observed, evidenced by changes in peak profile, the number of vibrational modes, as well as the pressure dependence of Raman lattice modes over different pressure ranges. The transition was identified irreversible for the lattice modes were not recovered upon decompression. In addition, a ring-opening reaction took place, suggested by the recovered Raman and IR internal modes. For cyanuric triazide, no phase transitions were observed in the pressure range of 0-26 GPa and one chemical reaction above 26 GPa. In addition, the transition was partially irreversible evidenced by the different Raman profiles in different parts of the sample. Possible reaction mechanisms were proposed accordingly.",2013
"1-Benzotriazolyl-2-propynones as novel 1,3-biselectrophiles, benzotriazole-assisted thioacylation and synthesis of energetic materials","New synthetic strategies for the synthesis of several target molecules are the theme of this work. 1-Benzotriazolyl-2-propynones were shown to be novel 1,3-bis-electrophilic synthons. These synthons provided a new route in the synthesis of pyrido[1,2 a ]pyrimidin-2-ones, 2 H -quinolizin-2-ones, pyrido[1,2- a ]quinolin-3-ones, and thiazolo[3,2- a ]pyrimidin-7-ones. These new 1,3-bis-electrophilic synthons were compared with previous 1,3-bis-electrophilic methodologies from the literature and expanded on the role of these synthons by novel synthesis of new heterocyclic systems. Aliphatic and aromatic thiocarbonyl-1 H -6-nitrobenzotriazoles were synthesized (Chapter 3) as novel thioacylating reagents. To show their synthetic utility, these thiocarbonyl-1 H -6-nitrobenzotriazoles were reacted with an alcohol to form the corresponding thionoesters. Chapter 4 summarizes the work accomplished in collaboration with the US Army on the reasonable synthesis and characterization of broadly defined energetic materials.",2006
Development of a sharp -interface Cartesian grid method for study of shock-initiated detonation in energetic materials,"The objective of the work is to develop a numerical method that can simulate the detonation of energetic materials in which pre-existing voids provide enhanced detonation sensitivity. Of particular interest are the effects of applied loads due to projectile impact and shocks, which may elicit catastrophic thermo-mechanical response in the elasto-viscoplastic energetic solid. To enable computations of such large deformation, high-strain rate material dynamics an Eulerian, sharp interface , fixed Cartesian grid method is presented. Mass, momentum, energy and species transport equations in Eulerian form are solved along with evolution equations for deviatoric stresses and equivalent plastic strain. We use high-order accurate ENO shock-capturing schemes along with particle level-set technique to evolve sharp immersed boundaries. The proposed numerical technique shows the ability to handle collisions between multiple level sets. We demonstrate that the method is simple, can be extended to three-dimensions and is capable of tackling the following physical phenomena encountered during impact and deformation: (1) Nonlinear wave-propagation. (2) Elasto-plastic behavior of the shocked material, including rate-dependent plasticity through the radial return algorithm. (3) Large deformations, including changes of topology during perforation of targets and collapse of voids. Results of calculations for axisymmetric Taylor bar impact and penetration of a Tungsten rod into steel plate show excellent agreement with moving finite element solutions and experiments. The method developed in this work is ideally suited to study the phenomenon of initiation of detonation in energetic materials. We investigate the thermo-mechanical consequences of void collapse in a plastic-bonded explosive (HMX). The mechanics of void collapse under shock-loading and the coupling of the void dynamics to the energy release in the solid material are analyzed. In keeping with the sharp interface approach, gas and solid phases are treated as separate regions and coupled through jump-and continuity-type interface conditions on the surface separating the condensed phase from the gas-filled void. Both condensed phase and gas phase reaction mechanisms are incorporated. Using this approach, insights are obtained into the mechanisms of initiation sensitivity due to energy localization in porous energetic materials.",2003
Destructive Effect of High-Temperature Heat Flow of Solid Slow-Release Energetic Materials on a Steel Target,"To investigate the high-temperature heat flow's destructive effect of solid slow-release energetic materials on a steel target, we prepared a sample of solid slow-release energetic materials, eruption devices, and a complete test system to conduct the destruction of high-temperature heat flow on the steel target. In addition, we proposed the energy density to characterise the high-temperature heat flow performance and numerically simulated the destructive effect of the high-temperature heat flow on the steel target. The numerical simulation results were in good agreement with the test results, and the error between them was under 8.5%. Based on the test and simulation results, the steady-state melting model of the steel target was established under the action of high-temperature heat flow. Moreover, a time-varying model of the melting hole shape was found. The results showed that the model of destroying the steel target with the high-temperature heat flow of solid slow-release energetic materials was highly accurate. Therefore, the model could provide theoretical guidance for designing and applying solid slow-release energetic materials in ammunition destruction, metal cutting, the simulation of the laser thermal effect, etc.",2023
Hydrogen bond system generated by nitroamino rearrangement: new character for designing next generation energetic materials,A new hydrogen bond system is formed by the transfer of a proton from nitroamino to form nitroimino.

Elucidating the Decomposition Mechanism of Energetic Materials with Geminal Dinitro Groups Using 2-Bromo-2-nitropropane Photodissociation,"These experiments photolytically generate two key intermediates in the decomposition mechanisms of energetic materials with nitro substituents, 2-nitropropene, and 2-nitro-2-propyl radicals. These intermediates are produced at high internal energies and access a number of competing unimolecular dissociation channels investigated herein. We use a combination of crossed laser-molecular beam scattering and velocity map imaging to study the photodissociation of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane at 193 nm and the subsequent unimolecular dissociation of the intermediates above. Our results demonstrate that 2-bromo-2-nitropropane has four primary photodissociation pathways: C-Br bond fission yielding the 2-nitro-2-propyl radical, HBr elimination yielding 2-nitropropene, C-N bond fission yielding the 2-bromo-2-propyl radical, and HONO elimination yielding 2-bromopropene. The photofragments are formed with significant internal energy and undergo many secondary dissociation events, including the exothermic dissociation of 2-nitro-2-propyl radicals to NO + acetone.. Calculations at the G4//B3LYP/6-311++g(3df,2p) level show that the presence of a radical at a nitroalkyl center changes the mechanism for and substantially lowers the barrier to NO loss. This mechanism involves an intermediate with a three center ring rather than the intermediate formed during the traditional nitro-nitrite isomerization. The observed dissociation pathways of the 2-nitro-2-propyl radical and 2-nitropropene help elucidate the decomposition mechanism of larger energetic materials with geminal dinitro groups.",2013
The elastic constants and related properties of the energetic material cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) determined by Brillouin scattering.,"The acoustic phonons of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) have been studied using Brillouin scattering. The analysis of the acoustic-phonon velocities allowed determination of the complete stiffness tensor for this energetic material. The results are compared to other recent experimental and theoretical determinations of the RDX elastic constants, bulk moduli, and shear moduli. The observed ordering of elastic constants, C11>C22>C33, is qualitatively associated with a (001) cleavage plane and molecular packing. This interpretation is further corroborated by the linear compressibilities plotted in three crystallographic planes, and a comparison to recent theoretical and experimental hydrostatic compression studies on RDX. Finally, the elasticity of RDX is compared to a recently published report on the beta polymorph of cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine's elasticity, and is related to several proposed mechanisms for detonation initiation.",n-14
Effect of Microstructure on Energy Release Characteristics of Al/Ni Energetic Structural Material Prepared by Cold Spraying,"Al/Ni energetic structural material with both high strength structural properties and high energy release functional properties can undergo a strong exothermic reaction under heating or impact loading conditions. In order to investigate the influence of microstructure on the mechanical properties and energy release characteristics of the Al/Ni energetic structural material, the materials with different Ni contents were prepared by cold spraying. With the increase of Ni particles, the microstructure inside the energetic structural material gradually changes from a continuous network structure of Al to a continuous network structure of Ni. The contact between Ni particles will make the stress transfer more uniform during the compression process of the energetic structural material, which enhances their strength. The results of heat-induced exothermic and shock-induced energy release show that the Al/Ni energetic structural material exhibits the best exothermic performance when Ni particles are uniformly dispersed and there are enough Al and Ni to make the material completely transform into the AlNi phase. The increase in the contact interface between Al and Ni particles facilitates the occurrence of a solid/solid reaction exothermic reaction between Al and Ni as well as the diffusion of Ni into the Al melt to generate the AlNi phase. The formation of the Ni continuous phase will lead to a reduction in the contact interface between Al and Ni, as well as an increase in porosity, which will result in a decrease in the amount of heat released during the diffusion reaction. This study will provide insights into the preparation of an Al/Ni energetic structural material with excellent properties.",2024
Cocrystallization of chelating-energetic-material and metal-organic-framework with the nitrogen-rich ligand bis(tetrazole)methane,"Two recently introduced concepts in the design of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs), namely Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Chelating energetic material (CEM), have been applied in the synthesis of the energetic manganese (II) compound {[Mn(btm)(H2O)(3)](2)center dot H2O}(n) (1) (H(2)btm = bis(tetrazole)methane), cocrystalized by a dinuclear CEM and a 1D MOF, which is characterized by elemental analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P-21/c. The Mn2+ was hexa-coordinated with two btm groups and three water molecules. Btm presents tridentate coordination modes. The thermal decomposition mechanism of 1 was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The non-isothermal kinetics parameters were calculated by the Kissinger's method and Ozawa-Doyle's method, respectively. Sensitivity tests revealed that 1 is insensitive to mechanical stimuli.",2018
Collapse of elongated voids in porous energetic materials: Effects of void orientation and aspect ratio on initiation,"The sensitivity of porous energetic materials depends on mesostructural heterogeneities such as voids, defects, cracks, and grain boundaries. The mesostructure of pressed explosives contains voids of arbitrary shapes including elongated voids of various orientations and aspect ratios. Mesoscale simulations to date have analyzed the effect of void morphology on the sensitivity of energetic materials for idealized shapes such as cylindrical, conical, and elliptical. This work analyzes the sensitivity behavior of elongated voids in an HMX matrix subject to shock loading. Simulations show that sensitivity of elongated voids depends strongly on orientation as well as aspect ratio. Ranges of orientations and aspects ratios are identified that enhance or inhibit initiation. Insights obtained from single elongated void analyses are used to identify sensitive locations in an imaged mesostructure of a pressed explosive sample.",2017
Preparation and characterization of Co,"Co3O4 nanorods were synthesized onto silicon substrates successfully by an ammonia-evaporation-induced method. Then Al was deposited on the synthesized Co3O4 samples by magnetron sputtering. The prepared Al/Co3O4 nanorods were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that Co3O4 nanorods grow vertically and compactly on silicon substrates with a diameter of similar to 400 nm. Nano-Al coated the outside of the Co3O4 nanorods to form a kind of core-shell nanostructure. Based on the differential scan thermal analysis, the optimal thickness of Al deposited on the Co3O4 was 5 mu m under experimental condition with a maximal exothermic heat of 2254 J/g. A kind of initiator was realized by integrating Al/Co3O4 with a semiconductor bridge (SCB) and its firing performance was tested. The discharge voltage threshold for the initiator was 45 V and its critical initiation energy varied from 8.30 mJ to 9.10 mJ. The combustion flame duration of the initiator was 180 mu s which was 80 mu s longer than that of ordinary SCB.",2015
PCB dual-switch fuse with energetic materials embedded: Application for new fail-safe and fault-tolerant converters,"In this article a generic and passive dual-switch fuse is designed to symmetrically disconnect a switching cell against a leg short circuit failure. A compact FR4 copper tracks - PCB structure is proposed combining a dual-fuse mode and a passive dual-switch mode thanks to the integration of energetic material embedded in the thickness of the assembly. Firstly, we present the mechanical design of the dual-switch and the first tests of rupture by means of assisted an energetic material buried. In a second step, we describe the design of the dual-fuse on PCB and electrothermal finite elements simulations by means of Comsol 3D (TM). Finally, a combined dual-switch fuse prototype is fully integrated and validated at DC350V-AC15A in a voltage source inverter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012
Chelates with π-stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions as safer and structurally reinforced energetic materials,"Three chelating energetic materials (CEM), [Co(SCZ)(2)(H2O)(2)](TNR)(H2O)(2) (1), [Ni(SCZ)(2)(H2O)(2)](TNR) (H2O)(2) (2) and [Zn(SCZ)(2)(H2O)(2)](TNR)(H2O)(2) (3, SCZ = semicarbazide, H2TNR = styphnic acid), were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that 1 mainly exhibits swathe construction, whereas 2 and 3 manifest grating structure. Thermal decomposition behaviors of 1-3 were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The critical temperature of thermal explosion, the entropy of activation (Delta S-not equal), the enthalpy of activation (Delta H-not equal), and the free energy of activation (Delta G(not equal)) were also calculated. Sensitivity tests revealed that 1-3 are insensitive to mechanical stimuli, and that the grating structure (2 and 3) shows better shock resistance and flame retardant property than the swathe construction (1) at the molecular level.

Learning to fly: thermochemistry of energetic materials by modified thermogravimetric analysis and highly accurate quantum chemical calculations,"The standard state enthalpy of formation and the enthalpy of sublimation are essential thermochemical parameters determining the performance and application prospects of energetic materials (EM). Direct experimental measurements of these properties are complicated by low volatility and high heat release in bomb calorimetry experiments. As a result, the uncertainties in the reported enthalpies of formation for a number of even well-known CHNO-containing compounds might amount up to tens kJ mol(-1), while for some novel high-nitrogen molecules they reach even hundreds of kJ mol(-1). The present study reports a facile approach to determining the solid-state formation enthalpies comprised of complementary high-level quantum chemical calculations of the gas-phase thermochemistry and advanced thermal analysis techniques yielding sublimation enthalpies. The thermogravimetric procedure for the measurement of sublimation enthalpy was modified by using low external pressures (down to 0.2 Pa). This allows for observing sublimation/vaporization instead of thermal decomposition of the compounds studied. Extensive benchmarking on nonenergetic and energetic compounds reveals the average and maximal absolute errors of the sublimation enthalpies of 3.3 and 11.0 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The comparison of the results with those obtained from the widely used Trouton-Williams empirical equation shows that the latter underestimates the sublimation enthalpy up to 140 kJ mol(-1). Therefore, we performed a reparametrization of the latter equation with simple chemical descriptors that reduces the mean error down to 30 kJ mol(-1). Highly accurate multi-level procedures W2-F12 and/or W1-F12 in conjunction with the atomization energy approach were used to calculate theoretically the gas-phase formation enthalpies. In several cases, the DLPNO-CCSD(T) enthalpies of isodesmic reactions were also employed to obtain the gas-phase thermochemistry for medium-sized important EMs. Combining the obtained thermochemical properties, we determined the solid-state enthalpies of formation for nearly 60 species containing various important explosophoric groups, from common nitroaromatics, nitroethers, and nitramines to novel nitrogen-rich heterocyclic species (e.g., the derivatives of pyrazole, tetrazole, furoxan, etc.). The large-scale benchmarking against the available experimental solid-state enthalpies of formation yielded the maximal inaccuracy of the proposed method of 25 kJ mol(-1).",2021
Machine Learning Enabled Quickly Predicting of Detonation Properties of N-Containing Molecules for Discovering New Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials are widely used in the fields of military, civil engineering, and space exploration. The discovery of new energetic materials is essential to develop next-generation technologies of weapon, mining, construction, and rocket propelling. In this study, a machine-learning-assisted method is developed for accelerating the discovery of new energetic materials via efficient prediction and quick screening. Suitable neural networks are established for accurately predicting the detonation properties of various N-containing molecules based on their structures, including density (rho), detonation velocity (D), and detonation pressure (P). Then, the minimum database volume for high-precision extended prediction is determined. A proof-of-concept study for discovering new energetic compounds using machine learning is carried out, and 31 new N-containing molecules with outstanding detonation properties are discovered. It is expected that the development of next-generation energetic materials is greatly accelerated by the application of this strategy assisted by machine learning.",2021
"Pressure DSC for energetic materials. Part 2. Switching between evaporation and thermal decomposition of 3,5-dinitropyrazole","Differential scanning calorimetry at an elevated external pressure (Pressure DSC) allows for shifting the vaporization of a sample to higher temperatures, thus often facilitating the direct observation of its thermal decomposition. In the present work, the thermolysis of a promising energetic material 3,5-dinitropyrazole was studied under pressures up to 10 MPa. The thermokinetic analysis of the datasets acquired at 2 and 5 MPa exhibited a pronounced kinetic compensation, thus allowing to build the joint formal kinetic model. The final kinetic scheme is comprised of the two parallel reactions, viz., the first-order process (E-a = 198 kJ mol(-1)) along with a first-order autocatalysis (E-a = 127 kJ mol(-1)). The experiment was complemented with the highly accurate CCSD(T)-F12 quantum chemical calculations. Theory revealed an unusual primary decomposition channel, viz., a sigmatropic [1,5]-1-shift followed by the pyrazole ring opening yielding a molecular nitrogen and a nitro radical as simple primary products. Apart from this, the comparative thermogravimetry at a normal pressure yielded the vapor pressure of 3,5-dinitropyrazole along with the internally consistent set of phase change enthalpies. In general, the pressure DSC is a facile technique to study the true decomposition kinetics of the compounds that vaporize/sublime in conventional DSC experiments.",2020
In-silico design of a new energetic material-1-Amino-5-nitrotetrazole with high energy and density,"Ideal energetic materials should first possess high energy and high crystal density for their practical applications. In this study, a new energetic material-1-amino-5-nitrotetrazole (ANTz) has been molecularly designed. ANTz has been demonstrated to possess highest gas-phase heat of formation (HOF) based on our theoretical calculations of 14 derivatives of tetrazole. Its high density value equally demonstrated its excellent performance. However, computational impact sensitivity (h(50)) has a great derivative with experimental BAM test impact sensitivity value for recently synthesized 2-amino-5-nitrotetrazole, which is ANTz's isomer. That makes us doubt the QSPR model of predicting impact sensitivity for tetrazole derivatives. Although we cannot precisely predict its impact sensitivity for the lack of suitable theoretical methods and incomplete database, ANTz is expected to be a good candidate as energetic material from the perspective of energy and density. The pyrolysis pathways of ANTz were also systematically analyzed, which demonstrated that ANTz is prone to decompose by direct ring rupture from a reaction kinetic perspective. And its preferable final products are HNO2, N-2 and CN3H. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016
On the nature of the burning rate-controlling reaction of energetic materials for the gas-phase model,"For model systems with known kinetics of elementary reactions (CH3NO2 and HN3), ternperature ranges are established in which the rate-controlling reactions are the initial endothermic decomposition of the starting material or the subsequent secondary reactions. Heat release in reactions of NO2, NO, and N2O with various fuels, such as CH2O, CO, H-2, and HCN, is modeled to establish the kinetic parameters and nature of the rate-controlling reactions in gas flames of nitro compounds. It is shown that the activation energy of the heat-release reaction due to the interaction of NO2 with a hydrocarbon fuel (which is characteristic of the first flame of nitro compounds) is ill the range of 29-33 kcal/mole, depending on the type of fuel. According to the calculations performed, the activation energy of the rate-controlling heat-releasing process due to the deoxidation of NO and N2O (which is typical of the second flame of nitro compounds) is 43-58 kcal/mole. In the range of high pressures, where the flames merge, the kinetic parameters of heat release are determined by the reactions of the most reactive nitrogen oxide NO2.",2007
Comprehensive study on impact of hydrogen peroxide decomposition on the crucial parameters of OSM-type energetic materials.,"The use of increasingly advanced energetic materials (EMs) in various branches of industry and military sectors increases the appropriate requirements for EMs, including: their durability, safety of use, chemical and high-energetic properties. Additionally, the impact of the products of the explosion of EMs on the natural environment is also crucial. Therefore, on-site mixture (OSM) energetic materials containing concentrated hydrogen peroxide (OSM-type energetic materials) are becoming increasingly popular. This is an extremely interesting group of materials that contains in excess of 50 wt.% hydrogen peroxide (HP) and not containing toxic compounds, and therefore is environmentally friendly. The main objective of the study was to investigate the various compositions of OSM-type energetic materials in terms of the evolution over time of their energetic properties (including the ""raw"" energetic material strength and the ability to sustain the propagation of a detonation wave) and the volume of the post-detonation gases. The obtained results show that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide strongly affects the detonation parameters of OSM-type energetic material and the decomposition time of HP. In addition, it has been proven that rate of decomposition of HP significantly affects the detonation parameters of OSM-type energetic materials. It was also found that the concentration of NO  x  is low and decreases dramatically with the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, but at the same time the concentration of carbon oxides increases. © 2024.

Multi-scale shock-to-detonation simulation of pressed energetic material: A meso-informed ignition and growth model,"This work presents a multiscale modeling framework for predictive simulations of shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) in pressed energetic (HMX) materials. The macro-scale computations of SDT are performed using an ignition and growth (IG) model. However, unlike in the traditional semi-empirical ignition-and-growth model, which relies on empirical fits, in this work meso-scale void collapse simulations are used to supply the ignition and growth rates. This results in a macro scale model which is sensitive to the meso-structure of the energetic material. Energy localization at the meso-scale due to hotspot ignition and growth is reflected in the shock response of the energetic material via surrogate models for ignition and growth rates. Ensembles of meso-scale reactive void collapse simulations are used to train the surrogate model using a Bayesian Kriging approach. This meso-informed Ignition and Growth (MES-IG) model is applied to perform SDT simulations of pressed HMXs with different porosity and void diameters. The computations are successfully validated against experimental pop-plots. Additionally, the critical energy for SDT is computed and the experimentally observed P-S(2)tau(S) = constant relations are recovered using the MES-IG model. While the multiscale framework in this paper is applied in the context of an ignition-and-growth model, the overall surrogate model-based multiscale approach can be adapted to any macro-scale model for predicting SDT in heterogeneous energetic materials.

Nitrogen-rich salts based on 5-hydrazino-1,"High-density energetic salts that contain nitrogen-rich anions and the 5-hydrazino-1H-tetrazolium cation were synthesized. All salts were fully characterized by vibrational spectroscopy (IR), multinuclear (H-1, C-13) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and impact sensitivity. Four compounds were characterized by single X-ray diffraction. The results show that the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the cations and anions form a complex 3D network, which contributes greatly to the high density of the 5-hydrazinotetrazolium salts. It was also found that the incorporation of hydrazino groups into a heterocyclic ring increases the heat of formation and overall nitrogen content of the entire molecule. Some of these salts exhibit reasonable physical properties, such as good thermal stability (T-d = 173.7-198.6 degrees C), reasonable impact sensitivities (IS = 4-40 J), and excellent specific impulses (I-sp = 196.1-288.7 s). In addition, detonation properties of the energetic salts obtained with EXPLO 5.05 identify them as competitively energetic compounds, and in some cases are superior to those of HMX.",2013
Characterization of dusts and impurities from the interaction between the first wall materials and energetic laser beams,"Study and control the formation mechanisms of dusts and impurities from the interaction between the edge plasma and the first wall materials are critical issues to achieve high performance in advanced tokamak (such as ITER). In this study, two major investigations have been carried out. Firstly, we have characterized the morphology and size of the dust particles formed from the interaction between the first wall materials and energetic laser beams. By choosing different laser powers we investigated the number and average size of dust particles as a function of deposited laser energy densities. The results indicate that the number and size of dust particles for tungsten and graphite targets both increase with laser power, but there are some differences in details between tungsten and graphite targets. This implies there are different mechanisms of dust generation for these two materials. Secondly, a high sensitivity molecular beam Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) has been developed to directly measure intermediate impurities from the interactions. This enables many intermediate impurities including transient clusters and ions are observed. The observed impurity ions are C-n(+), n=4-32. The intensity distribution of the measured Cn+ indicates that larger carbon impurities are formed by complicated ways: probably including both syntheses by step growth and fragmentation from nano/micro flakes.

"Review of thermal decomposition, kinetics parameters and evolved gases during pyrolysis of energetic materials using different techniques","Thermal decomposition, kinetics parameters, and evolved gases during pyrolysis of energetic materials using different techniques have been widely studied experimentally and theoretically since a long time ago and up to now. The overall reaction processes and the conditions at which can be achieved and the quality and quantity of evolved gases obtained during their thermal decomposition still need more concern and investigation. The thermal analysis techniques such as (TG), (DSC), (DTA), FTIR, MS, or different combinations of them as a couple (TG-FTIR), (TG-MS) or triple (TG-MS-FTIR) are considered effective techniques for studying the thermal degradation of these materials. They allow a better understanding of the different pathways of chemical reactions and control the thermal behavior of these materials. The various kinetic models used to determine the kinetic parameters and the produced data from the measuring techniques also create deviations between the values of kinetic parameters for the same material used. Energetic materials of various classes and characterizations are introduced in this review and the values of kinetic parameters and gas product types are presented in tabulated forms and discussed. A comparison between the kinetic parameters values and evolved gas types for the same and different materials is presented in tabulated form and discussed.",2022
Calculation Method of Magnetic Material Losses Under DC Bias Using Statistical Loss Theory and Energetic Hysteresis Model,"The loss prediction of magnetic materials under dc bias is of great significance for the optimization of magnetic components, because the efficiency evaluation of magnetic components involves core loss computation under dc bias. Aiming to develop a calculation method for magnetic material losses under dc bias, a novel dynamic energetic hysteresis model combining the statistical theory of losses (STL) with a static energetic hysteresis model is proposed. Firstly, the effects of dc bias on the hysteresis, classical, and excess loss components are analyzed, respectively, using STL. Then, based on the equivalent field separation technique, the magnetic fields corresponding to classical and excess losses are derived using the analytical equations proposed by STL. Finally, a new dynamic energetic hysteresis model, which can take all the hysteresis, classical, and excess losses of magnetic materials under dc bias into account, is devised with the superposition principle. The simulation and experimental results confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model.",2019
Crystal morphology prediction of energetic materials grown from solution: insights into the accurate calculation of attachment energies,"As a crucial factor, crystal morphology significantly influences the energy and safety properties of energetic materials (EMs). Theoretical prediction of crystal morphology is helpful for scientifically engineering the shape of EM crystals. Currently, the attachment energy (AE) model has been the most widely used method of crystal morphology prediction in the field of EMs. However, the calculation details of modified AE in solution and the physical meaning of some corrected parameters are still unclear, sometimes leading to discrepant predicted results even for the same EM. Here, HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane) was taken as a case study and the details of AE calculation were systematically explored. The formula of AE in solution was corrected and a new functional form was proposed. The growth morphology of a HMX crystal in acetone solution was predicted, which is similar to those of the occupancy model, the spiral growth model, and the interfacial structure analysis model. The results reported in this contribution are aiming at the development of a more reasonable and accurate method for predicting the crystal shape of EMs.",2019
Effects of parametric uncertainty on multi-scale model predictions of shock response of a pressed energetic material,"Predictive simulations of shock-to-detonation transitions (SDTs) of energetic materials must contend with uncertainties in the material properties, reactive models, and the microstructures of the material. In this work, we analyze the effects of uncertainties in the run-to-detonation distance h of a pressed energetic (HMX) material due to variabilities in the thermomechanical properties of HMX. The run distances are computed using a recently developed machine-learning based multiscale modeling framework, viz., the Meso-informed Ignition and Growth (MES-IG) model. The input uncertainties are first used in the MES-IG model to quantify the variabilities in the hotspot dynamics at the mesoscale. A Kriging-based Monte Carlo method is used to construct probability density functions (pdfs) for the mesoscale reaction-product formation rates; these are used to propagate the mesoscale uncertainties to the macroscale reaction-progress variables to construct pdfs for the run-to-detonation distance h. We evaluate uncertainties in h due to variabilities in six material properties, viz., specific heat, Gruneisen parameter, bulk modulus, yield strength, thermal expansion coefficient, and the thermal conductivity of the material. Among these six properties, h is found to be most sensitive to the variabilities in the specific heat of the material; the uncertainties in the specific heat amplify exponentially across scales and result in logarithmic pdfs for h. Thus, the paper not only quantifies and propagates uncertainties in material properties across scales in a multiscale model of SDT, but also ranks the properties with respect to the sensitivity of the SDT response of heterogeneous energetic materials on each property.",2019
"Structural, electronic and elastic properties of several metal organic frameworks as a new kind of energetic materials","The structural, electronic and elastic properties for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as energetic materials are investigated using non-local density functional theory with dispersion correction.

The electronic structure analysis reveals that NHN is a metal, while the others are semiconductors or insulators with band gap from 0.1 eV to 4.7 eV. NHP, CHP, CHHP and CuAN are predicted to be magnetic. We also discuss the impact sensitivities of MOF-EMs in terms of their electronic structures.

Comparing the Catalytic Effect of Metals for Energetic Materials: Machine Learning Prediction of Adsorption Energies on Metals,"Energetic materials (EMs) and metals are the important components of solid propellants, and a strong catalysis of metals on EMs could further enhance the combustion performance of solid propellants. Accordingly, the study on the adsorption of EMs such as octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and ammonium dinitramide (ADN) on metals (Ti, Zr, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Al) was carried out by density functional theory (DFT) to reveal the catalytic effect of metals. The deep dissociation of EMs on Ti and Zr represents a stronger interaction and corresponds to the rapid thermal decomposition behavior of the EMs/metal composite in the experiment. It is expected that DFT calculation can be selected instead of experiments to compare the catalytic effect of metals and preliminarily screen out potential high-performance metals. Based on the data set of the calculated adsorption energy, further machine learning (ML) was used to predict the adsorption energy of EMs on metals for a convenient comparison of the catalytic effect of metals, since a quite high adsorption energy value represents a more thorough dissociation. The kernel ridge regression (KRR) method shows the best performance on predicting adsorption energy and helps to choose the metals for efficiently catalyzing ammonium nitrate (AN) and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). Such adsorption computation and ML not only reveal the decomposition mechanism of EMs on metals but also provide a simple underlying method to predict the catalytic effect of metals.",2023
Theoretical relationship between vibrational properties and impact sensitivity of energetic materials from the phonon upon transition theory,"Based on the phonon-upon transition theory of energetic materials in molecular crystals, we analyzed the vibration properties of seven energetic materials with different chemical properties in doorway modes. The vibrational modes are divided into the phonon manifold and the intramolecular vibrational manifold. The phonon-vibron coupling is proportionally related to the energy transfer rates from the phonon manifold to the intramolecular vibration modes. Using the first-principles method of calculation, we calculated the energy transfer rates from the phonon manifold to the intramolecular vibration modes and discussed the relationship between energy transfer rates and experimental impact sensitivity. Our results show that there is a good correlation between the energy transfer rates and the impact sensitivity of energetic materials.",2024
The sensitivity determination of energetic materials from laser spark spectrometry based on physical-parameter-corrected statistical methods,"The traditional large-dosage and dangerous methods for the determination of the sensitivities of energetic materials (EMs) have always led to low-accuracy diagnoses with poor repeatability, since they are affected by crystalline quality, experimental conditions, etc. Herein, a simple method is developed to determine various sensitivities, such as impact sensitivity, friction sensitivity, electrostatic sensitivity, and laser sensitivity, via laser spark spectrometry (LSS), with the consumption of only several milligrams of EM, rather than macro-detonation testing. Based on suitable correlated prediction models using the entire LSS spectrum and physical-parameter-corrected statistical regression, the friction sensitivity, electrostatic sensitivity, and laser sensitivity can be well predicted, evaluating the impact of various factors on sensitivity. The correlations between plasma temperature and impact sensitivity, electron density and friction sensitivity, and oxygen balance and electrostatic sensitivity are also clarified. This can facilitate sensitivity predictions with high precision. This method provides a safe, low-dosage, high-precision, and low-cost approach for sensitivity estimations of EMs.",2021
Thermal decomposition of energetic materials using TG-FTIR and TG-MS: a state-of-the-art review,"Energetic materials have been widely investigated experimentally and theoretically for decades, but there are still many unanswered questions concerning their thermal decomposition mechanisms that play a key role in the overall reaction processes. Hyphenated analytical techniques of thermal analysis, such as thermogravimetry coupled either with infrared (TG-FTIR) or mass spectroscopies (TG-MS) have been revealed to be efficient methods for studying such mechanisms. These methods allow the exploration of the evolved gases during the thermal decomposition, which let to trace back the chemical decomposition mechanisms and allows better control of the thermal behavior of various energetic formulations. In this overview, a classification, characterization and properties of energetic material are introduced. Next, advances in the application of two hyphenated techniques (TG-FTIR and TG-MS) along with appropriate examples are discussed. These techniques offer remarkable improvements by enhancing the amount of authentic information obtained with better reproducibility compared to conventional techniques. This first review article dedicated solely to the application of TG on-line coupled with an IR or MS spectrometer, by means of a heater transfer line, will certainly help researchers to easily understand the behavior of energetic materials as well as the development of new applications.",2020
Effects of Temperature on Novel Molecular Perovskite Energetic Material (C,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the energetic molecular perovskite (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)], with excellent detonation properties, thermal stability, and high specific impulse, which is a potential replacement for AP as the next generation propellants. The cohesive energy density, binding energy, pair correlation function, maximum bond length (L-max) of the N-H trigger bond, and mechanical properties of the (C6H14N2)[NH4(ClO4)(3)] were reported. The calculated cohesive energy density and binding energy decrease with increasing temperature, indicating a gradual decrease in the thermal stability with temperature. In addition, H O hydrogen bonding interactions have been found based on the results of pairwise correlation functions. The maximum length (L-max) of the N-H trigger bond was calculated and used as a criterion to theoretically judge the impact sensitivity. The maximum bond length of the N-H trigger bond grows gradually with temperature; however, it does very slightly yet gradually above 373 K. This suggests that an increase in temperature leads to a higher impact sensitivity and lower thermal stability. However, this effect becomes less pronounced when the temperature surpasses 373 K. Moreover, the calculated mechanical data indicate that as the temperature rises, the material's stiffness, hardness, yield strength, and fracture strength all decrease. The material's ductility shows an upward trend with increasing temperature, reaching its peak at 373 K and subsequently declining as the temperature continues to rise.",2024
Development of robust and rapid self-healing polymers for the repair of microcracks in energetic composite materials,"Adhesives with exceptional toughness and self-healing properties are vital for the practical application of energetic composite materials (ECMs). However, the majority of self-healing polymers used in ECMs lack sufficient toughness. In this study, we address this challenge by incorporating asymmetric alicyclic and bent biphenyl ring structures into the hard domain units of polymers. The synthesized PUDS-3 films exhibit a remarkable toughness of up to 20.93 MJ center dot m(-3), recovering over 90% of this toughness within just 20 min after a complete fracture. This behavior results from the synergistic interaction between dynamic disulfide and hydrogen-bonding mechanisms during the restructuring process. Furthermore, elevated temperatures led to a rapid decrease in the relaxation modulus and characteristic relaxation time of the PUDS samples, effectively accelerating crack healing. Both experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that a higher hard segment content in the adhesive corresponded to increased strength in the interfacial interaction with 1,3,5-trinitro-2,4,6-triaminobenzene (TATB). Upon accidental mechanical damage, the cracked ECMs displayed significant and efficient self-healing capabilities within 24 h at 60 degrees C. The utilization of these self-healing and highly toughness adhesives hold promising prospects for enhancing the safety and longevity of ECMs.",2023
Meso-scale simulation of energetic materials. I. A method for generating synthetic microstructures using deep feature representations,"The response of a wide class of heterogeneous energetic materials (HEs) to loads is determined by dynamics at the meso-scale, i.e., by physicochemical processes in their underlying microstructure. Structure-property-performance (S-P-P) linkages for such materials can be developed in a multi-scale framework, connecting the physics and thermophysical properties at the meso-scale to response at the macro-scale. Due to the inherent stochasticity of the microstructure, ensembles of microstructures are required to conduct meso-scale simulations to establish S-P-P linkages. Here, a deep neural network-based method called deep feature representation is applied to generate a range of material microstructures from heterogeneous energetic materials to metal foams and metallic mixtures. The method allows for the generation of stochastic microstructures using a single real microstructure as the input and is not limited to low packing density or topological complexity of solids. In its application to pressed energetic materials, we show that qualitative and quantitative features of real (i.e., imaged) microstructures are captured in the synthetic microstructures. Therefore, a stochastic ensemble of synthetic microstructures can be created for use in reactive meso-scale simulations to relate the microstructures of HEs to their performance. While the focus is on pressed HE microstructures, we also show that the method is general and useful for generating microstructures for in silico experiments for a wide range of composite/multiphase materials, which can be used to establish S-P-P linkages.",2022
Models for predicting impact sensitivity of energetic materials based on the trigger linkage hypothesis and Arrhenius kinetics,"In order to predict the impact sensitivity of high explosives, we designed and evaluated several models based on the trigger linkage hypothesis and the Arrhenius equation. To this effect, we calculated the heat of detonation, temperature of detonation, and bond dissociation energy for 70 energetic molecules. The bond dissociation energy divided by the temperature of detonation proved to be a good predictor of the impact sensitivity of nitroaromatics, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81. A separate Bayesian analysis gave similar results, taking model complexity into account. For nitramines, there was no relationship between the impact sensitivity and the bond dissociation energy. None of the models studied gave good predictions for the impact sensitivity of liquid nitrate esters. For solid nitrate esters, the bond dissociation energy divided by the temperature of detonation showed promising results (R-2 = 0.85), but since this regression was based on only a few data points, it was discredited when model complexity was accounted for by our Bayesian analysis. Since the temperature of detonation correlated with the impact sensitivity for nitroaromatics, nitramines, and nitrate esters, we consider it to be one of the leading predictive factors of impact sensitivity for energetic materials.",2020

A 7.62 mm energetic bullet filled with PTFE-Mg-based reactive materials for anti-drone application,"To counter thin and lightweight targets such as drone swarms, a specialized design of 7.62 mm energetic bullets has been developed. These bullets utilize reactive materials as the core encased in a copper jacket, offering the advantages of impact-induced energy release, multiple damage, and lightweight. The study involved the preparation of three energetic bullets using the reactive materials (different ratio of PTFE-Mg-Bi2O3 and PTFE-MgBi2O3-W) and systematically evaluating their destructive effect. The results showed that three energetic bullets (EB-A, EB-B, and EB-W) successfully penetrated two-layer stacked 2 mm 50# cold-rolled steel targets, and the respective reaction durations observed during the penetration process were 4.1, 3.5, and 9.2 ms. After armorpiercing, energetic bullets released an amount of chemical energy and produced fragmentation, deflagration reactions, and overpressure destructive effects. To further investigate the damage mechanism of the three reactive material-filled bullets, a detailed analysis of PTFE-Mg-based reactive material, such as reaction energy, burning rate, combustion temperature field, reaction overpressure, was conducted. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of energy release performance of the reactive materials and damage behavior of the energetic bullets.",2024

Scanning the energy dissipation process of energetic materials based on excited state relaxation and vibration-vibration coupling,"The energy dissipation mechanism of energetic materials (EMs) is very important for keeping safety. We choose nitrobenzene as a model of EM and employ transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-resolved coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) to clarify its energy dissipation mechanism. The TA data confirms that the excited nitrobenzene spends about 16 ps finishing the twist intramolecular charge transfer from benzene to nitro group, and dissipates its energy through the rapid vibration relaxation in the initial excited state. And then the dynamics of vibrational modes (VMs) in the ground state of nitrobenzene, which are located at 682 cm(-1) (v(1)), 854 cm(-1) (v(2)), 1006 cm(-1) (v(3)), and 1023 cm(-1) (v(4)), is scanned by CARS. It exhibits that the excess energy of nitrobenzene on the ground state would further dissipate through intramolecular vibrational redistribution based on the vibrational cooling of v(1) and v(2) modes, v(1) and v(4) modes, and v(3) and v(4) modes. Moreover, the vibration-vibration coupling depends not only on the energy levels of VMs, but also on the spatial position of chemical bonds relative to the VM.",2018
On the use of mechanical and acoustical excitations for selective heat generation in polymer-bonded energetic materials,"To address security issues in both military and civilian settings, there is a pressing need for improved explosives detection technologies suitable for trace vapor detection. In light of the strong dependence of vapor pressure on temperature, trace vapor detection capabilities may be enhanced by selectively heating target materials by external excitation. Moreover, polymer-bonded energetic materials may be particularly susceptible to heating by mechanical or acoustical excitation, due to the high levels of damping and low thermal conductivities of most polymers. In this work, the thermomechanical response of polymer-based energetic composites and methods for acoustical excitation are investigated in order to improve the understanding of the temperature rises induced by applied excitation, and to uncover waveforms which may efficiently transmit excitation energy to generate heat and enhance trace vapor detection capabilities. The heat generation in the binder material of energetic and surrogate systems under harmonic excitation was investigated analytically through the application of a viscoelastic material model. Specifically, structural-scale heating was considered under low-frequency direct mechanical excitation as applied to a beam geometry. Experiments were conducted with a mock mechanical material, wherein the mechanical and thermal responses were recorded by scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography, respectively. Direct comparisons between the model and experimental results demonstrated good agreement with the predicted response, with low-order, bulk-scale heating observed along the modal structure in areas of higher strains. In addition, localized heating near individual crystals was investigated analytically by extending the viscoelastic heating model to general three-dimensional stress-strain states. Application of the model to a Sylgard 184 binder system with an embedded HMX (octogen) crystal under ultrasonic excitation revealed predictions of significant heating rates, particularly near the front edge of the crystal, due to the wave scattering and the resulting stress concentrations. In considering methods for such excitation through incident acoustical or ultrasonic waves, the form of the wave profile was tuned in this work for the purpose of maximizing the energy transmission into solid materials. That transmission is generally limited by the large impedance mismatch at typical fluid--solid interfaces, but by varying the spatial distribution of the incident wave pressure, significant transmission increases can be achieved. In particular, tuned incident inhomogeneous plane waves were found to predict much lower values of the reflection coefficient, and hence large increases in the energy transmission in the context of lossless and low-loss dissipative media. Also, material dissipation was found to have a strong effect on the optimal incident waveform, generally causing a shift to lower inhomogeneity values. Similar results were obtained for parameterized forms of bounded incident waves with respect to the local reflection phenomena and surface wave excitation. These results suggest that, depending on the targeted solid material, substantial energy transmission and heat generation increases may be achieved by tailoring the spatial form of the incident wave profile.",2016
Thermochemical modeling of temperature controlled shock-induced chemical reactions in multifunctional energetic structural materials under shock compression,"Multifunctional energetic structural materials (MESMs) are a new class of energetic materials which release energy due to exothermic chemical reactions initiated under shock loading conditions. In order to analyze shock-induced chemical reactions (SICR) for MESMs, theoretical models have been developed to calculate the Hugoniot data which include the heat released by shock temperature controlled reactions. The temperature rise of porous materials due to shock compression is first calculated using a constant volume and pressure adjustment. Then the Arrhenius reaction rate and Avrami-Erofeev kinetic models are used to calculate the extent of reaction of MESMs under shock compression. Thermochemical models for shock-induced reactions, in which the reaction efficiency is considered, are given by combining the shock temperature rise with the chemical reaction kinetics. The Hugoniot relations and temperatures are calculated by using the proposed method. The models developed have been validated against the experimental SICR data involving Fe2O3/Al, Al/Ni, and Ti/Ni mixtures. It has been shown that the theoretical calculations correlate reasonably well with the corresponding experimental and simulation results. The models presented can be used to predict the reaction results of MESMs over a wide range of pressure satisfactorily. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

"DFT investigation on detonation properties and sensitivities of bridged triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazine based energetic materials","A series of bridged triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazine based energetic materials were optimized at B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level of density functional theory (DFT), and their detonation properties and sensitivities were calculated. The results show that the -N-N- bridge/-N-3 group were beneficial to improve values of heats of formation while -N-N- bridge/-C(NO2)(3) group can improve detonation properties remarkably. In view of the sensitivities, compound F2 possesses the minimum values of impact sensitivity which reveals that -NHNH- bridge/-C(NO2)(3) group will decrease the stability of the designed compounds. Take both of detonation properties and sensitivities into consideration, compounds C8, E7, E8, F8 were screened as candidates of potential energetic materials since these compounds possess similar detonation properties and sensitivities values to those of RDX.

"Study on regulation effect of external electric field on energetic material 1-methyl-2,4,5-Trinitroimidazole","In this work, in order to explore the regulation effect of external electric field (EEF) on various properties of 1methyl-2,4,5-trinitroimidazole (MTNI), density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the molecular structure, electronic structure, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy of MTNI under EEF. The results show that: (1) EEF significantly affects the geometric and electronic structure of MTNI, which in turn affects the sensitivity of MTNI. (2) When the EEF in the positive direction increases, the energy gap of MTNI decreases significantly and the total density of states (TDOS) turns to be dominated by the nitro groups. (3) EEF makes MTNI appear new absorption peak in visible light region and thus makes the MTNI display color. The generation of new absorption peaks is also dominated by the nitro groups. We also carefully analyzed how EEF deforms structure of the MTNI from the perspective of atomic forces and decomposition of energy variation.",2022
Materials with good energetic properties resulting from the smart combination of nitramino and dinitromethyl group with furazan,"In order to develop energetic materials with better comprehensive properties, energetic salts based on bifunctionalized furazan with nitramino and dinitromethyl group were synthesized and fully characterized by multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13 or N-15), IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Structural and chemical properties of the nitrogen-rich energetic material triaminoguanidinium 1-methyl-5-nitriminotetrazolate under pressure,"The structural and chemical properties of the bi-molecular, hydrogen-bonded, nitrogen-rich energetic material triaminoguanidinium 1-methyl-5-nitriminotetrazolate C3H12N12O2 (TAG-MNT) have been investigated at room pressure and under high pressure isothermal compression using powder x-ray diffraction and Raman and infrared spectroscopy. A stiffening of the equation of state and concomitant structural relaxation between 6 and 14 GPa are found to correlate with Raman mode disappearances, frequency discontinuities, and changes in the pressure dependence of modes. These observations manifest the occurrence of a reversible martensitic structural transformation to a new crystalline phase. The onset and vanishing of Fermi resonance in the nitrimine group correlate with the stiffening of the equation of state and phase transition, suggesting a possible connection between these phenomena. Beyond 15 GPa, pressure induces irreversible chemical reactions, culminating in the formation of a polymeric phase by 60 GPa. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Synthesis and characterization of manganese vanadate nanopebbles: as energetic electrode material for trichlorophenol detection and supercapacitor applications,"Binary transition metal oxides have achieved tremendous attention owing to their intrinsic physicochemical properties. In this work, we construct a sensitive electrocatalyst manganese vanadate (MnV2O6) that was syn-thesized hydrothermally and used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst.

Predicting Energetic Material Properties and Investigating the Effect of Pore Morphology on Shock Sensitivity via Machine Learning,"An improved understanding of energy localization (“hot spots”) is needed to improve the safety and performance of explosives. In this work I establish a variety of experimental and computational methods to aid in the investigation of hot spots. In particular, focus is centered on the implicit relationship between hot spots and energetic material sensitivity. To begin, I propose a technique to visualize and quantify the properties of a dynamic hot spot from within an energetic composite subjected to ultrasonic mechanical excitation. The composite is composed of an optically transparent binder and a countable number of HMX crystals. The evolving temperature field is measured by observing the luminescence from embedded phosphor particles and subsequent application of the intensity ratio method. The spatial temperature precision is less than 2% of the measured absolute temperature in the temperature regime of interest (23-220 ◦C). The temperature field is mapped from within an HMX-binder composite under periodic mechanical excitation. Following this experimental effort I examine the statistics behind the most prevalent and widely used sensitivity test (at least within the energetic materials community) and suggest adaptions to generalize the approach to bimodal latent distributions. Bimodal latent distributions may occur when manufacturing processes are inconsistent or when competing initiation mechanisms are present. Moving to simulation work, I investigate how the internal void structure of a solid explosive influences initiation behavior – specifically the criticality of isolated hot spots – in response to a shock insult. In the last decade, there has been a significant modeling and simulation effort to investigate the thermodynamic response of a shock induced pore collapse process in energetic materials. However, the majority of these studies largely ignore the geometry of the pore and assume simplistic shapes, typically a sphere. In this work, the influence of pore geometry on the sensitivity of shocked HMX is explored. A collection of pore geometries are retrieved from micrographs of pressed HMX samples via scanning electron microscopy. The shock induced collapse of these geometries are simulated using CTH and the response is reduced to a binary “critical” / “sub-critical” result. The simulation results are used to assign a minimum threshold velocity required to exhibit a critical response to each pore geometry. The pore geometries are subsequently encoded to numerical representations and a functional mapping from pore shape to a threshold velocity is developed using supervised machine-learned models. The resulting models demonstrate good predictive capability and their relative performance is explored. The established models are exposed via a web application to further investigate which shape features most heavily influence sensitivity. Finally, I develop a convolutional neural network capable of directly parsing the 3D electronic structure of a molecule described by spatial point data for charge density and electrostatic potential represented as a 4D tensor. This method effectively bypasses the need to construct complex representations, or descriptors, of a molecule. This is beneficial because the accuracy of a machine learned model depends on the input representation. Ideally, input descriptors encode the essential physics and chemistry that influence the target property. Thousands of molecular descriptors have been proposed and proper selection of features requires considerable domain expertise or exhaustive and careful statistical downselection. In contrast, deep learning networks are capable of learning rich data representations. This provides a compelling motivation to use deep learning networks to learn molecular structure-property relations from “raw” data. The convolutional neural network model is jointly trained on over 20,000 molecules that are potentially energetic materials (explosives) to predict dipole moment, total electronic energy, Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation velocity, C-J pressure, C-J temperature, crystal density, HOMO-LUMO gap, and solid phase heat of formation. To my knowledge, this demonstrates the first use of the complete 3D electronic structure for machine learning of molecular properties.",2020

Effect of Interface Chemical Composition on the High Strain Rate Dependent Mechanical Behavior of an Energetic Material,"A combined experimental and computational study has been performed in order to understand the effect of interface chemical composition on the shock induced mechanical behavior of an energetic material (EM) system consisting of Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) binder and an oxidizer, Ammonium Perchlorate (AP), particle embedded in the binder. The current study focuses on the effect of interface chemical composition between the HTPB binder material and the AP particles on the high strain rate mechanical behavior. The HTPB-AP interface chemical composition was changed by adding cyanoethylated polyamine (HX-878 or Tepanol) as a binding agent. A power law viscoplastic constitutive model was fitted to nanoscale impact based experimental stress-strain-strain rate data in order to obtain the constitutive behavior of the HTPBAP interfaces, AP particle, and HTPB binder matrix. An in-situ mechanical Raman spectroscopy framework was used to analyze the effect of binding agent on cohesive separation properties of the HTPB-AP interfaces, AP particle, and HTPB binder matrix. In addition, a combined mechanical Raman spectroscopy and laser impact set up was used to study the effect of strain rate, as well as the interface chemical composition on the interface shock viscosity. Finally, high velocity strain rate impact simulations were performed using an explicit cohesive finite element method framework to predict the effect of strain rate, interface strength, interface friction, and interface shock viscosity on possible strain rate dependent temperature rises at high strain rates approaching shock velocities. A modified stress equation was used in the cohesive finite element framework in order to include the effect of shock viscosity on the shock wave rise time and shock pressure during impact loading with strain rates corresponding to shock impact velocities. It is shown that increasing the interface shock viscosity, which can be altered by changing the interface chemical composition, increases the shock wave rise time at the analyzed interfaces. It is shown that the interface shock viscosity also plays an important role in determining the temperature increase within the microstructure. Interface shock viscosity leads to a decrease in the overall density of the possible hot-spots which is caused by the increase in dissipation at the shock front. This increase in shock dissipation is accompanied by a decrease in the both the maximum temperature, as well as the plastic dissipation energy, within the microstructure during shock loading.",2018

Integrated Lagrangian and Eulerian 3D microstructure-explicit simulations for predicting macroscopic probabilistic SDT thresholds of energetic materials,"Computational predictions of measures for macroscopic material attributes from the microstructure scale is a fundamental challenge in materials science. Data transfer across scales and physics-based models plays a central role in this highly material-specific process. Here, we present an approach for computationally establishing the probabilistic shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) threshold or pop plot (PP, the relation between run-to-detonation distance and applied pressure) of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) from three-dimensional (3D) simulations. The approach takes respective advantages of multiphysics Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling frameworks. The combined Lagrangian and Eulerian simulations provide an explicit account of 3D heterogeneous material microstructure at sizes up to tens of mm, mechanisms for the development of hotspots, and the coupled mechanical-thermal-chemical-transport processes which underlie the behaviors being predicted. Data transfers in the form of hotspot intensity fields from the Lagrangian simulations to the Eulerian simulations link the two frameworks. To capture the fundamental nature of the multiphysics processes, the source, and the propagation of the stochastic variations in material behavior, a 3D statistically equivalent microstructure sample set (SEMSS) is designed and used. The approach facilitates an efficient quantification of the probabilistic macroscopic detonation thresholds, leading to an analytical expression for the PP that accounts for both the microstructure effects and uncertainties. The material system modeled tracks the properties of PBX 9501 and the loading conditions studied involve shock pressure P-s in the range of 11-15GPa.

Calculations of the interactions of energetic ions with materials for protection of computer memory and biological systems,"Theoretical calculations were performed for the propagation and interactions of particles having high atomic numbers and energy through diverse shield materials including polymeric materials and epoxy-bound lunar regolith by using transport codes for laboratory ion beams and the cosmic ray spectrum. Heavy ions fragment and lose energy upon interactions with shielding materials of specified elemental composition, density, and thickness. A fragmenting heavy iron ion produces hundreds of isotopes during nuclear reactions, which are treated in the solution of the transport problem used here. A reduced set of 80 isotopes is sufficient to represent the charge distribution, but a minimum of 122 isotopes is necessary for the mass distribution. These isotopes are adequate for ion beams with charges equal to or less than 26. To predict the single event upset (SEU) rate in electronic devices, the resultant linear energy transfer (LET) spectra from the transport code behind various materials are coupled with a measured SEU cross section versus LET curve. The SEU rate on static random access memory (SRAM) is shown as a function of shield thickness for various materials. For a given mass the most effective shields for SEU reduction are materials with high hydrogen density, such as polyethylene. The shield effectiveness for protection of biological systems is examined by using conventional quality factors to calculate the dose equivalents and also by using the probability of the neoplastic transformation of shielded C3H10T1/2 mouse cells.

The crystal structures of compounds 3 and 4 are similar and crystallize in monoclinic systems with the P2(1)/c space group, while the central copper atoms show different coordination behaviors. However, the structure of compounds 3 and 4 is analogous to a three dimensional structure owing to the O atom of OH-, forming coordinate bonds with three copper cations. The NBO charge of 2 was calculated using density functional theory to understand its coordination modes.

The Role of Adhesion and Elastic Modulus on the Sensitivity of Energetic Materials to Vibration and Impact,"The transformation of mechanical energy into thermal energy within composite energetic materials through various thermomechanical mechanisms is thought to lead to the creation of localized areas of intense heating. The growth of these “hot spots” is responsible for the bulk reaction or decomposition of the energetic material. Understanding the formation and growth of these hot spots has been an active area of research particularly for high-speed impact and shock conditions, but further work remains to be done in particular with respect to hot spot formation due to periodic mechanical excitation. Previous literature has established that many potential thermomechanical mechanisms may act at the interface between the constituent components of a composite energetic material. In order to provide further insight and guidance into the design of safer and more resilient energetic materials, the role of adhesion on hot spot formation for polymer bonded explosives (PBXs), a subset of composite energetic materials, was explored. Single HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane) crystals in polymer blocks were subjected to ultrasonic excitation and subsequent heating was captured via infrared thermography. Subsequent testing of HMX PBXs using a drop weight tower captured changes in the sensitivity of the energetic material. Variation of the polymer binder allowed for a range of adhesive and mechanical properties to be examined. These experiments on the role of adhesion under these kinds of excitations provided insight into how mechanical energy is being transformed into localized heating.",2021
Hematite: A Good Catalyst for the Thermal Decomposition of Energetic Materials and the Application in Nano-Thermite,"Metal oxides (MOs) are of great importance in catalysts, sensor, capacitor and water treatment. Nano-sized MOs have attracted much more attention because of the unique properties, such as surface effect, small size effect and quantum size effect, etc. Hematite, an especially important additive as combustion catalysts, can greatly speed up the thermal decomposition process of energetic materials (EMs) and enhance the combustion performance of propellants. This review concludes the catalytic effect of hematite with different morphology on some EMs such as ammonium perchlorate (AP), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylenete-tranitramine (HMX), etc. The method for enhancing the catalytic effect on EMs using hematite-based materials such as perovskite and spinel ferrite materials, making composites with different carbon materials and assembling super-thermite is concluded and their catalytic effects on EMs is also discussed. Therefore, the provided information is helpful for the design, preparation and application of catalysts for EMs.",2023
Multi-Level Structural Design Strategy toward Low-Sensitivity Energetic Materials: From Planar Molecule to Layered Packing Crystal,"Layered packing structures have been of great interest in the field of energetic materials (EMs) due to their excellent balances between energy and safety. Nevertheless, the present advanced layered EMs and rational design approaches are still lacking. In this work, we proposed a multi-level structural design strategy for layered EMs, from molecular to crystal level. Inspired by the experimentally known energetic crystals with the specific NH2 center dot center dot center dot NO2 intermolecular motifs, we established a set of guidelines for designing and screening potential target molecules based on the H2N-C-C-NO2 moiety via a systematic analysis of structure/composition-performance relationships. Subsequently, the possible crystal packing structures were searched accurately by the evolutionary algorithm USPEX coupled with a recently developed energetic molecule-specific polarizable force field. The theoretical results show that B1 (4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dinitro-[5,5'-biisoxazole] 2,2'-dioxide) and C2 [(E)-3,3'-(diazene-1,2-diyl) bis (4-amino-5-nitroisoxazole 2-oxide)] are promising candidates of advanced layered EMs with good mechanical sensitivities (better than TNT) and detonation performances (superior to FOX-7). Hopefully, our multi-level design procedure can accelerate the discovery of novel layered EMs with advanced properties.",2022
Decoding the crystal engineering of graphite-like energetic materials: from theoretical prediction to experimental verification,"Energetic materials with a graphite-like crystal structure always demonstrate better energy-sensitivity balance than the common ones. However, the knowledge on how to design a graphite-like energetic material is still limited and a rational design procedure for graphite-like energetic materials is much desired. Here, a set of systematic methods for discovering new graphite-like energetic materials is presented. We analyzed the intermolecular self-assembled behavior of graphite-like energetic materials and proposed a combined method of coplanar configuration searching (CCS) and point-chain-plane progressive intermolecular assembly (pcp-PIA) to predict and screen new graphite-like energetic materials. Furthermore, with a self-established high-throughput design system, we rapidly focused on a potential graphite-like energetic molecule (namely, 2-azido-5-nitropyrimidine-4,6-diamine, DANAP) from 426 candidates and finally experimentally verified its graphite-like crystal structure. We believe that the method presented here will have potential applications in guiding the crystal engineering of graphite-like energetic materials, thereby accelerating the discovery of new energetic materials with promising properties.",2020
"Hydrogen- and Halogen-bond Driven Supramolecular Architectures from Small Molecules to Cavitands, and Applications in Energetic Materials","A family of six β-diketone based ligands capable of simultaneously acting as halogen-bond (XB) donors (each of para and meta substituted chloro, bromo and iodo functionalities) and chelating ligands was synthesized. Four ligands were characterized by X-ray diffraction to identify the structural behavior of the ligand itself. The free ligands bearing bromine and iodine show XB interactions (C-X˙˙˙O) whereas the ligand containing chlorine did not show XB interactions. The corresponding Cu(II) complexes for ligands were also synthesized in different solvents such as acetonitrile, ethyl acetate and nitromethane. Both acetonitrile and ethyl acetate participate in XB interactions with XB donors (Br or I) although nitromethane does not participate in such interaction. Metal-ligand complexes with iodine as XB donor in the para position engage in XB interactions to make extended supramolecular architecture when the solvent is nitromethane. When the XB donor attached in the meta position of the ligand, formation of extended supramolecular architecture was seen even in the presence of a strongly coordinating solvent such as acetonitrile. Two tetra functionalized molecules bearing hydrogen-bond (HB) donors (-OH) and XB donors (-C≡C-I) and one tetra functionalized molecule which has only HB donors (-OH and -C≡C-H) were synthesized. The donor molecules themselves show potential for making HB and XB interactions with the available acceptor sites present in the system. The competition between intermolecular HB and XB was explored by co-crystallizing with suitable nitrogen based acceptors. HB and XB donors showed equal competitiveness toward common acceptors when making HB/ XB interactions. Furthermore, the geometry and relative positioning of the donor sites can, in certain cases, change the balance between the competing interactions by favoring HB interactions. A series of cavitands functionalized with XB donors, HB/XB donors and β-diketone have been synthesized. Binding preferences of XB and HB/XB cavitands towards a series of suitable HB/XB acceptors were studied in solid state and they have confirmed the presence of interactions between donor and acceptors. Cavitands with β-diketone functionality were subjected to binding studies with metal ions in solution as well as in the solid state. Successful metal-ligand complexation in solid state as well as in solution state based on UV/Vis titrations have been confirmed. In order to stabilize chemically unstable energetic compound, pentaerythritol tetranitrocarbamate ( PETNC ), a co-crystallization approach targeting the acidic protons was employed. A co-crystal, a salt and a solvate were obtained and the acceptors were identified as supramolecular protecting groups leading to reduced chemical reactivity and improved stability of PETNC with minimal reduction of desirable energetic properties. Several potential tetrazole based explosives which are thermal and impact sensitive and solid propellants which are impact sensitive were subjected to co-crystallization experiment to stabilize and enhance their properties. Co-crystals and salts of the explosives were obtained with suitable nitrogen based and oxygen based acceptors. The impact sensitivity and thermal instability of the explosives were improved with the introduction of co-formers. Oxygen based acceptors have shown more favorable explosive property improvements compared to nitrogen based acceptors with significant retention of explosive nature of the parent explosives.",2018
"4-Amino-3-hydrazino-1,2,4-triazole: a Precursor for the Preparation of Divalent Energetic Materials","4-Amino-3-hydrazino-1,2,4-triazole (AHT) was developed as a divalent cation. The multivalent structure can be used to increase the number of nitrogen-rich heterocycles, thereby increasing the heat of formation and improving the detonation performance. Herein we report on a family of divalent energetic salts, which exhibit excellent properties, viz. acceptable density, good detonation performance, and desirable thermal and impact stabilities. The structural features of the salts were further determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, the detonation properties calculated for these energetic salts identified them as competitively energetic compounds.",2018
Convenient synthesis of energetic polynitro materials including (NO,"The nucleophilic Michael addition of nitroform with acrylamide creates a variety of energetic products. Several interesting compounds with a trinitromethyt group were synthesized, among them salts containing the trinitropropylammonium cation, [(NO2)(3)CCH2CH2NH3]X. Owing to their positive oxygen balance, the suitability of these compounds as potential high-energy dense oxidizers (HEDOs) in energetic formulations was investigated and discussed. Furthermore, numerous important and reactive compounds for the continuing synthesis of molecules with a high oxygen balance are presented. All compounds were fully characterized, including muttinuclear NMR spectroscopy, vibrational analysis (IR, Raman), elemental analysis, as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction. Thermal stabilities were studied using differential scanning calorimetry and sensitivity data against friction, impact and electrostatic discharge were collected. The energies of formation were calculated using Gaussian 09 and energetic properties, such as the specific impulse and detonation velocity, were predicted with the EXPLO5 (V6.02) computer code.",2016
Enhanced ignition and combustion performance of boron-based energetic materials through surface modification and titanium dioxides coating,"The present study focuses on the removal of ineffective hydroxyl surface (B -OH) of the shell of pristine boron (B) particles, followed by its modification using a low-cost, eco-friendly, and non-hazardous ethylene glycol (EG). Subsequently, very small-sized titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) particles are coated onto the boron surface by adding titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursors at room temperature. Characterization techniques were employed to investigate the structure and morphology of these materials. FTIR, XPS, and TEM analysis reveal that EG effectively removes ineffective boron hydroxyl surfaces and modifies the surface through passivation by its surface functionalities. Furthermore, EG assists in the coating very small-sized TiO 2 particles on the boron surface. Thermal stability tests show that the modified boron surface and TiO 2 -coated boron surface exhibit earlier oxidation of the core boron compared to pristine boron. This enhanced capability for earlier oxidation of core boron was further investigated in the shock tube and bomb calorimeter for measurement of ignition delay time and heat of combustion. The findings demonstrate that room temperature synthesized TiO 2 -coated B particles (ignition delay time of -181 mu s and heat of combustion of -17.3 kJ/g) outperform pristine B particles (ignition delay time of -284 mu s and heat of combustion of -13.2 kJ/g). This improvement is attributed to the removal of ineffective boron hydroxyl surfaces, surface modification, uniform coating with very small TiO 2 particles, the catalytic effect of TiO 2 on oxygen diffusion, and effective oxidation of core boron. This study suggests that efficient energetic material can be achieved at room temperature with no potential harm to the environment.",2024
Application of Machine Learning to the Design of Energetic Materials: Preliminary Experience and Comparison with Alternative Techniques,"The last few years have seen a steep rise in the use of data-driven methods in different scientific fields historically relying on theoretical or empirical approaches. Chemistry is at the forefront of this paradigm shift due to the longstanding use of computational tools involved in the calculation of molecular structures and properties. In this paper, we showcase examples from the literature as well as work in progress in our lab in order to give a brief overview on how these methods can benefit the energetic materials community. A deep learning approach is compared to ""traditional"" QSPR and semi-empirical approaches for molecular property prediction, and specificities inherent to energetic materials are discussed. Deep generative models for the design of new energetic materials are also presented. We conclude by giving our view on the most promising strategies for future in silico generation of new energetic materials satisfying the performance/sensitivity trade-off.",2023
"Design and computational insight into two novel CL-20 analogues, BNMTNIW and BNIMTNIW: high performance energetic materials","In this study, a theoretical insight into two newly designed novel CL-20 based high performance energetic compounds, namely bis(nitro-methyl)-tetranitrohexaaza-isowurtzitane (BNMTNIW) and bis(nitratomethyl)-tetranitrohexaaza-isowurtzitane BNIMTNIW), is reported. The title compounds are expected to exhibit good densities, 2.05 g cm(-3) and 1.98 g cm(-3), respectively, and high positive enthalpies of formation ((Delta H-f degrees(g) = 731.5 kJ mol(-1); Delta H-f degrees(s) = 539.7 kJ mol(-1)) and (Delta H-f degrees(g)=605.6kJmol(-1);Delta H-f degrees(s)=400.3kJmol(-1))) and excellent detonation performance (DP = 44.18 and 41.42 GPa, Dv = 9735 and 9460 m sec(-1)), respectively. Computed bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and impact sensitivities (IS) suggest that these molecules are more stable than 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW, CL-20). We also propose a synthetic strategy for the preparation of BNMTNIW and BNIMTNIW from a commercially available starting material, glyoxal. IR and Raman spectra of BNMTNIW and BNIMTNIW are predicted. These attractive propulsive and explosive properties and better thermal stability and sensitivity than CL-20 (HNIVV) suggest the great potential of the title compounds as high energy density materials.",2022
Theoretical study on N-oxide pentazolate high-energy-density materials: Toward excellent energetic performance and good stability,"The limited energetic performance has been one of major factors restricting the development of pentazolate materials. In this study, the cyclo-N-5(-) ring was combined with nitroxide coordinate bonds to form a novel cyclo-N5O- anion with higher oxygen contents. From the N-oxide pentazolate anion, nine cyclo-N5O- energetic salts (A1-A9) and three covalent compounds (B1-B3) were presented. Density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed to investigate the structures and energetic performance of all compounds. Based on the calculation results, the cyclo-N5O- salts A1-A9 exhibit enhanced densities and higher detonation performance than cyclo-N-5(-) salts in the previous work. Compounds B1-B3 also feature high densities (1.84-1.94 g cm(-3)) and excellent heats of formation (1011.9-1057.6 kJ mol(-1)). Among all materials, compounds A1, A9, and B1 exhibit remarkable detonation performance (D: 10 138, 9911, 9950 m s(-1); P: 43.9, 40.9, 41.4 GPa), which are much superior to CL-20. All compounds feature good impact stabilities (h(50): 11-55 cm). Such excellent energetic performance demonstrates that N-oxide pentazolate derivatives are expected to be promising candidates as high-energy-density materials.",2022
Crystal Engineering of Energetic Materials: Co-crystals of Ethylenedinitramine (EDNA) with Modified Performance and Improved Chemical Stability,"In the area of energetic materials, co-crystallization is emerging as a new technology for modifying or enhancing the properties of existing energetic substances. Ethylenedinitramine (EDNA) is a known energetic material which requires attention partly due to its chemical instability originating with its two highly acidic protons. In order to stabilize EDNA, a co-crystallization approach targeting the acidic protons using a series of co-crystallizing agents with suitable hydrogen-bond acceptors was employed. Fifteen attempted co-crystallizations resulted in eight successful outcomes and six of these were crystallographically characterized and all showed evidence of hydrogen bonds to the intended protons. Calculated detonation properties and experimental thermal and impact data for the co-crystals were obtained and compared with those of pure EDNA. The co-crystal of EDNA and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene was recognized as a more thermally stable alternative to EDNA while the cocrystal of EDNA and pyrazine N, N'-dioxide showed comparable detonation strengths (and much improved chemical stability) compared with that of EDNA. The co-crystals EDNA: 4,4'-bipyridine and EDNA: pyrazine N,N'-dioxide were found to be about 50% less impact sensitive than EDNA, all of which illustrate how co-crystallizations can be utilized for successfully modifying specific aspects of energetic materials.",2015
Triggering the mechanism of the initial reaction of energetic materials under pressure based on Raman intensity analysis,"The Raman intensity and other stoichiometric calculations of nitromethane (NM) and 2-nitrimino-5-nitro-hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (NNHT) have been made by using first-principles density functional theory. We propose a method to judge the initial reaction mechanism of NM and NNHT under pressure based on the Raman intensity. Both the resulting NM and NNHT undergo hydrogen transfer and conventional trigger bond cleavage. And the results obtained from the Raman peak intensities infer a reaction path that is not inferior to the traditional C-NO2 and N-NO2 bond cleavage, thus verifying our results.",2023
Alleviating the energy & safety contradiction to construct new low sensitivity and highly energetic materials through crystal engineering,"Low sensitivity and highly energetic materials (LSHEMs), with both high energy and sufficient safety, are highly desired in practical applications. With respect to energy and safety, as the two most important and hottest concerns in the field of energetic materials (EMs), it is extensively deemed that there is an inevitable and inherent contradiction between them: a higher energy goes with a lower safety. This is the so-called energy and safety (E&S) contradiction. This article highlights this contradiction and finds that this contradiction is structure-level dependent. That is, it appears most necessarily and remarkably as an inherent one only at the molecular level, while at the crystal level and other higher ones, it can be largely alleviated. Moreover, we think that the energy and safety originate from the thermodynamics and kinetics of the decomposition reactions of EMs, respectively, and accordingly the contradiction becomes a thermodynamickinetic one. We thereby propose a strategy for developing LSHEMs, i.e., increasing the energy by increasing the chemical energy stored in molecules and by enhancing the molecular packing compactness, while, enhancing safety by making external stimuli more and more insufficient to ignite the EMs, through crystal engineering and mixing technologies. As an intrinsic structure of EMs, the crystal packing with face-to-face pi-pi stacking supported by strong interlayered intermolecular interactions favors the formation of LSHEMs or it is proposed to enhance intermolecular interactions and the anisotropy of these interactions to build low impact sensitivity energetic crystals.",2018
Detonation Performance of Insensitive Nitrogen-Rich Nitroenamine Energetic Materials Predicted from First-Principles Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,"Because of the excellent combination of high detonation and low sensitivity properties of the 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) energetic material (EM), it is useful to explore new energetic derivatives that start with the FOX-7 structure. However, most such derivatives are highly sensitive, making them unsuitable for EM applications. An exception is the new nitroenamine EM, 1,1-diamino-2-tetrazole-2-nitroethene (FOX-7-T) (synthesized by replacing a nitro group with a tetrazole ring), which exhibits good stability. Unfortunately, FOX-7-T shows an unexpected much lower detonation performance than FOX-7, despite its higher nitrogen content. To achieve an atomistic understanding of the insensitivity and detonation performance of FOX-7 and FOX-7-T, we carried out reactive molecular dynamics (RxMD) using the ReaxFF reactive force field and combined quantum mechanics MD (QM-MD). We found that the functional group plays a significant role in the initial decomposition reaction. For FOX-7, the initial decomposition involves only simple hydrogen transfer reactions at high temperature, whereas for FOX-7-T, the initial reaction begins at much lower temperature with a tetrazole ring breaking to form N2, followed by many subsequent reactions. Our first-principles-based simulations predicted that FOX-7-T has 34% lower CJ pressure, 15% lower detonation velocity, and 45% lower CJ temperature than FOX-7. This is partly because a larger portion of the FOX-7-T mass gets trapped into condensed phase carbon clusters at the CJ point, suppressing generation of gaseous CO2 and N2 final products, leading to reduced energy delivery. Our findings suggest that the oxygen balance is an important factor to be considered in the design of the next generation of high-nitrogen-containing EMs. © 2024 The Authors.

Energetic decomposition of distributed systems with moving material domains: The port-Hamiltonian model of fluid-structure interaction,"We introduce the geometric structure underlying the port-Hamiltonian models for distributed parameter systems exhibiting moving material domains. The first part of the paper aims at introducing the differential geometric tools needed to represent infinite-dimensional systems on time-varying spatial domains in a port-based framework. A throughout description on the way we extend the structure presented in the seminal work [25], where only fixed spatial domains were considered, is carried through. As application of the proposed structure, we show how to model in a completely coordinate-free way the 3D fluid-structure interaction model for a rigid body immersed in an incompressible viscous flow as an interconnection of open dynamical subsystems.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

"A Study of a Protective Container for Combined Blast, Fragmentation and Thermal Effects from Energetic Materials Detonation","A composite protective container is experimentally investigated to counter combined blast, fragmentation and thermal effects from either a 1.0 kg bare or 0.6 kg cased (pipe-bomb) TNT equivalent charge. Commercially available shaving foam was used as the internal filling material. The shaving foam quenched the initial fireball and afterburning reactions. The composite case contained the blast overpressure and prevented the escape of primary fragments. The novel combination of extended polystyrene (EPS) foam, hakelite and polyurethane (PU)-silica composite employed at the container base provided protection against in-contact explosive detonation. Maximum peak reflected overpressure of 86.87 kPa (12.6 psi) was measured at 1.0 m distance for 1.0 kg TNT equivalent charge detonation inside the container. The protective container provided 97% peak overpressure reduction compared to the equivalent surface burst detonation. The fragmentation and their impact on container were simulated using a coupled SPH-ALE approach. Steel casing fragments weighing up to 8.0 g with velocities in the range of 1260-1550 m/s were produced and impacted the container. This investigation provides a basis in the design of a device to combat terrorist devices in public places, high profile meeting venues and transportation systems.",2022
Evaluating the Bulk Lorentz Factors of Outflow Material: Lessons Learned from the Extremely Energetic Outburst GRB 160625B,"GRB 160625B is an extremely bright outburst with well-monitored afterglow emission. The geometry-corrected energy is high, up to similar to 5.2 x 10(52) erg or even similar to 8 x 10(52) erg, rendering it the most energetic GRB prompt emission recorded so far. We analyzed the time-resolved spectra of the prompt emission and found that in some intervals there were likely thermal-radiation components and the high energy emission was characterized by significant cutoff. The bulk Lorentz factors of the outflow material are estimated accordingly. We found out that the Lorentz factors derived in the thermal- radiation model are consistent with the luminosity-Lorentz factor correlation found in other bursts, as well as in GRB 090902B for the time-esolved thermal-radiation components, while the spectral cutoff model yields much lower Lorentz factors that are in tension with the constraints set by the electron pair Compton scattering process. We then suggest that these spectral cutoffs are more likely related to the particle acceleration process and that one should be careful in estimating the Lorentz factors if the spectrum cuts at a rather low energy (e.g., similar to tens of MeV). The nature of the central engine has also been discussed, and a stellarmass black hole is favored.",2017
Hazard evaluation of ignition sensitivity and explosion severity for three typical MH,"MgH2, TiH2, and ZrH2 are three typical metal hydrides that have been gradually applied to composite explosives and propellants as additives in recent years. To evaluate ignition sensitivity and explosion severity, the Hartmann device and spherical pressure vessel were used to test ignition energy and explosion pressure, respectively. The results showed that the ignition sensitivity of ZrH2, TiH2 and MgH2 gradually increased. When the concentration of MgH2 is 83.0 g/m(3) in Hartmann device, the ignition energy attained a minimum of 10.0 mJ. The explosion pressure of MgH2 were 1.44 times and 1.76 times that of TiH2 and ZrH2, respectively, and the explosion pressure rising rate were 3.97 times and 9.96 times that of TiH2 and ZrH2, respectively, through the spherical pressure vessel. It indicated that the reaction reactivity and reaction rate of MgH2 were higher than that of TiH2 and ZrH2. In addition, to conduct in edepth theoretical analysis of ignition sensitivity and explosion severity, gas production and combustion heat per unit mass of ZrH2, TiH2 and MgH2 were tested by mercury manometer and oxygen bomb calorimetry. The experimental results revealed that MgH2 had a relatively high gas production per unit mass (5.15 mL/g), while TiH2 and ZrH2 both had a gas production of less than 2.0 mL/g. Their thermal stability gradually increased, leading to a gradual increase in ignition energy. Furthermore, compared with theoretical combustion heat, the combustion ratio of MgH2, TiH2 and ZrH2 was more than 96.0%, with combustion heat value of 29.96, 20.94 and 12.22 MJ/kg, respectively, which was consistent with the explosion pressure and explosion severity test results.

Further, pressure response and strong anisotropy are exhibited by Raman spectra analysis under hydrostatic and uniaxial compressions. Calculated Raman spectrum is well in accordance with experimental data at ambient conditions. Under uniaxial compression, the anisotropic vibration properties of alpha-RDX in different lattice directions are presented.

Synthetic and thermal studies of four insensitive energetic materials based on oxidation of the melamine structure,"Oxidation of nitrogen-rich aromatic heterocycles has a significant impact on the development of energetic materials. 2,4,6-Triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3-dioxide (MDO) is a promising insensitive energetic backbone obtained from melamine under strong oxidation conditions with impressive thermal behaviors and detonation performances. In this paper, MDO was prepared with improved yields of 85% and its thermal behavior, non-isothermal decomposition kinetics and gas products were investigated in detail. The corresponding decomposition mechanism was also deduced by applying the TG-DSC-FTIR-MS technique for the first time. The decomposition temperature of MDO reaches 300 degrees C and the apparent activation energy of MDO (E) calculated by the Kissinger and Ozawa method proved to be 303.63 and 279.95 kJ mol(-1), indicating great thermal stability. Three new monoanionic energetic salts with impressively improved properties were achieved based on the basicity of MDO with yields of >80%. Their thermal decomposition temperatures proved to be higher than 230 degrees C and their densities are in the range of 1.75-1.89 g cm(-3). The calculations and experiments show that their detonation velocities (v(D): 8711-9085 m s(-1)) are comparable to or exceed those of RDX (D: 8795 m s(-1)) while the sensitivities to impact (IS: 23-27 J) and friction (FS: >240 J) are much lower.",2021
"Energetic Cost for Being ""Redox-Site-Rich"" in Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage with Nickel-Aluminum Layered Double Hydroxide Materials","Defining the energetic landscape of pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) upon redox-site enrichment is essential to harnessing their power for effective energy storage. Here, coupling acid solution calorimetry, in situ XRD, and in situ DRIFTS, we demonstrate that as the Ni/Al ratio increases, both as-made (hydrated) and dehydrated NiAl-LDH samples are less stable as evidenced by their enthalpies of formation. Moreover, the higher specific capacity at an intermediate Ni/Al ratio of 3 is enabled by effective water-LDH interactions, which energetically stabilize the excessive near-surface Ni redox sites, solvate intercalated carbonate ions, and fill the expanded vdW gap, paying for the ""energetic cost"" of being ""redox-site-rich"". Thus, from a thermodynamic perspective, engineering molecule/solid-LDH interactions on the nanoscale with confined guest species other than water, which energetically impose stronger stabilization, may help us to achieve their specific capacitance potential.",2020
"Multipurpose [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-","Two series of [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazine-based energetic materials were synthesized effectively by using monosubstituted tetrazine or tetrazine-based fused rings as starting materials. Among them, compound 5 exhibits excellent insensitivity toward external stimuli (IS = 43 J and FS > 360 N) and a very good calculated detonation performance (D-v = 9408 m s(-1) and P = 37.8 GPa) that are comparable to the current secondary-explosive benchmark, CL-20, which strongly suggests 5 as a secondary explosive. The azo compound 10 has a remarkable measured density of 1.91 g cm(-3) at 20 degrees C, excellent thermal stability (T-d = 305 degrees C), and very good calculated detonation performance (D-v = 9200 m s(-1) and P = 34.8 GPa), which outperforms all current heat-resistant explosives.

These attractive features suggest strong possibilities for applications as primary explosives.

Nitrogen-rich salts of 1-methyl-5-nitriminotetrazolate:: An auspicious class of thermally stable energetic materials,"I-Methyl-5-nitriminotetrazole (1) was formed by nitration of 1-methyl-5-aminotetrazole, which was obtained by methylation of sodium 5-aminotetrazolate. 1 was deprotonated using potassium hydroxide forming the corresponding potassium salt (2), which was transformed into silver 1-methyl-5-nitriminotetrazolate (3) by the reaction with silver nitrate. Guanidinium (4), I-aminoguanidinium (5), 1,3-diaminoguanidinium (6), 1,3,5-triaminoguanidinium (7), and azidoformamidinium (8) 1-methyl-5nitriminotetrazolate were prepared by metathesis reactions either using 2 and guanidinium perchlorates or 3 and guanidiniurn chlorides under the precipitation of KClO4 or AgCl, respectively. All compounds were fully characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSQ as well as bomb calorimetry. Since the packing of molecules in the solid state influences the properties of materials significantly, a detailed description of the crystal structures of 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 is given. Using the heats of combustion the heats of formations were calculated to be strongly endothermic. Several detonation parameters like the detonation pressure and detonation velocity were calculated using the EXPL05 software. In addition the sensitivities were tested using the BAM drop hammer and friction tester. With respect to developing newhigh explosives triaminoguanidinium 1-methyl-5-nitriminotetrazolate shows the most promising values and was therefore successfully tested in a Koenen Test (critical diameter :S 10 mm).",2008
Polypyrrole material for the electrostatic discharge sensitivity mitigation of Al/SnO,"Nanothermites are composite energetic materials made of fuel and oxidizer nanoparticles characterized by impressive exothermic reactions (highly flame temperatures and impressive heat combustion releases). However, nanothermites suffer from their high electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity that may be at the origin of accidental ignitions during handling. The present study deals with the use of doped-polypyrrole conducting polymer in aluminum/tin (IV) oxide energetic formulation (Al/SnO2). X-ray diffraction, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, conductivity measurements, sensitivities and combustion tests were implemented to characterize the polypyrrole-doped Al/SnO2 energetic composite. The results revealed a significant gradual ESD desensitization of the nanothermite (<0.14 mJ to 246.40 mJ) as a function of the doped-polypyrrole amount (0 to 15 wt%). The reactive properties of the polypyrrole-enriched Al/SnO2 nanothermite were verified and an acceptable reactive behavior was claimed. The successful adding of doped-polypyrrole conducting polymer within energetic nanocomposites is reported for the first time.",2021
Green electrosynthesis of CuN3 energetic materials coupled with energy-saving hydrogen production reaction,"Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to efficient hydrogen production. Replacing OER with thermody-namically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction can effectively improve the energy conversion efficiency in overall water splitting (OWS). Here, a new coupling system of green electro-oxidation synthesis of CuN3 primary explosive energetic materials and energy-saving hydrogen production is introduced. The cathodic catalyst is prepared by a two-step hydrothermal reaction to load ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) molybdenum sulfide nanosheets (MoS2-NSs), and shows superior alkaline hydrogen production (HER) activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ru NPs would induce local electron redistribution of in-plane MoS2 and optimize the adsorption capacity of the intermediates. The electro-oxidation synthesis of CuN3 energetic materials coupled with cathodic HER significantly reduce the cell voltage to only 1.07 V with current density of 10 mA cm-2, allowing low-energy-consumption hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the green electrosynthesis of CuN3 avoids generation of high-risk HN3 gas, high temperature, and long reaction time in the traditional method. This study demonstrates a new strategy of green electrosynthesis of primary explosive and energy-saving hydrogen production.",2023
Novel Random Forest Ensemble Modeling Strategy Combined with Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship for Density Prediction of Energetic Materials,"With the further development of the concept of green chemistry, the new generation of energetic materials tends to exhibit detonation properties such as higher insensitivity, higher density, and higher energy. Therefore, the precise molecular design and green and efficient synthesis of energetic materials will be one of the serious challenges. For the purpose of accurate prediction of detonation performance of energetic materials, an ensemble modeling strategy based on the combination of Monte Carlo (MC) and variable importance measurement (VIM) improved random forest (RF) and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) is proposed, which was successfully used for density prediction of energetic materials. First, the structure of 162 energetic compounds was optimized by Gaussian software, and the molecular descriptor data were calculated by CODESSA software based on the optimized molecular structure. Then, the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble model was constructed on the basis of the above molecular descriptor data and the corresponding energetic compound density index. The joint X-Y distance algorithm (SPXY) is used to partition the data set. And then, MC is used to further divide the calibration set data into multiple subsets for the construction of the ensemble model. The subset size and the number of iterations of the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble model were optimized through MC cross validation. The final output strategy of the ensemble model is optimized based on the optimized parameters, and an output optimization method based on median screening is proposed and successfully applied for the prediction performance optimization of the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble model. To further investigate the performance of the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble model, the performance of it was compared with partial least squares, RF, VIMRF, and MCVIMRF calibration models. It shows that the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble model can achieve a better prediction result for the density of energetic materials, with R2 CV of 0.9596, RMSECV of 0.0437 g/cm3, R2P of 0.9768, RMSEP of 0.0578 g/cm3, and relative analysis deviation of prediction set of 3.951. Therefore, the MCVIMRF_Med ensemble modeling strategy combined with QSPR is an effective approach for the density prediction of energetic materials. This work is expected to provide new research ideas and technical support for accurate prediction of detonation performance of energetic materials.",
Symmetric Refunctionalization of Diaminodinitropyrazine with Hydrazine and Aminotetrazole: Strategy for Enhancing Detonation Performance and Safety in Energetic Materials,"Two novel nitrogen-rich green energetic compounds were synthesized for the first time from readily available and cost-effective pyrazine starting materials. All newly synthesized molecules were comprehensively characterized, including infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, and thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry. All compounds have additionally been validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The physicochemical properties of compounds 2, 4, and 5 were thoroughly investigated. Notably, all compounds exhibit remarkable performance, such as a high density (>1.84 g cm(-3)), excellent detonation properties (VOD > 8582 m s(-1), and DP > 31.3 GPa), outstanding thermostability (>205 degrees C), and high insensitivity (IS > 35 J, and FS = 360 N). These attributes are quite comparable to those of secondary benchmark explosives such as TATB, RDX, LLM-105, and FOX-7. This tuned performance evidences that the incorporation of hydrazine, nitro, and aminotetrazole into the pyrazine framework fosters robust nonbonded interactions, ultimately enhancing thermal stability and reducing sensitivity. The findings of this study not only signify that compounds 2 and 5 have excellent detonation properties and stability but also prove that the strategy of replacing amino groups with hydrazine and aminotetrazole is a practical means of developing new insensitive energetic materials.",2024
Fast explosive performance prediction ,"Fast, reproducible, and quantitative performance evaluation of monomolecular energetic materials (EMs) is a significant challenge that limits the tailored applications of EMs and the development of new high-energy-density materials. Here, a small-dose-based alternative method for the detection of the detonation velocity (DV), heat of detonation (HoD), volume of detonation (VoD), detonation pressure (DP), and detonation temperature (DT) from laser-induced shock-wave images combined with a machine learning algorithm is proposed. On the basis of a comprehensive investigation of the time-resolved plume dynamic behavior and spectral emission properties, we concluded that the exothermic chemical reaction associated with detonation occurred at about 25 mu s after the laser pulse termination. Moreover, 27 types of explosives were tested to build the prediction model to validate the proposed theory. Our model accurately predicted the explosion parameters with an average relative error of test set (ARETe) of the models for the DV, VoD, and DT of <5%. In particular, the maximum relative error of test set (MRETe) of the quantitative analysis model for the DV and VoD was less than 4%. Our results demonstrate the value of laser-based micro-explosion technology in an explosion testing system and provide an analytic means for estimation of the detonation performance of EMs in a high-speed, less-consumption, low-cost, high-precision, and practical way.",2022
The thermal catalytic effects of CoFe-Layered double hydroxide derivative on the molecular perovskite energetic material (DAP-4),"The application of nano-catalytic materials in molecular perovskite energetic materials is of great significance to promote the development of molecular perovskite energetic materials in explosive formulations and propellants. In this paper, the thermal catalytic effects of CoFe-layered double hydroxide derivative on the molecular perovskite energetic material (DAP-4) were studied. In this study, we successfully prepared a new type of CoFebased photothermal agent (CoFe-500) by heating CoFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets in an Ar atmosphere at 500 degrees C. And the micromorphology, structure composition, thermal decomposition performances of CoFe-500 and DAP-4/CoFe-500 composite were characterized. The experimental results showed that with the addition of CoFe-500, the initial decomposition temperature and peak exothermic temperature of DAP-4 showed a decreasing trend. With 10 wt% CoFe-500 added, the initial decomposition temperature and peak exothermic temperature of DAP-4 decreased from 305.6 degrees C to 166.3 degrees C and 379.0 degrees C-322.5 degrees C, respectively (10 degrees C/min heating rate). The apparent activation energy (Ea) of pure DAP-4 is 172.27 kJ/mol and 175.13 kJ/mol calculated by the Kissinger and Ozawa method, respectively. And with 10 wt% CoFe-500 added, the Ea is reduced to 119.11 kJ/mol and 122.84 kJ/mol, respectively. The possible thermal catalytic decomposition mechanism of DAP-4/ CoFe-500 composites was proposed from the thermal analysis and mass spectrometry test results. This work is meaningful to further understand the decomposition performances of DAP-4 in the presence of nano-layered double hydroxide.",2021
Glycerol-controlled synthesis of a series of cobalt acid composites and their catalytic decomposition toward several energetic materials,"One of the challenges in solid propellant formulation is the ability to extend the combustion performance by efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of energetic additives. Herein, a series of cobalt acid composites nano-MCo2O4 (M = Cu, Ni, Zn, Mg, Fe, Ba) with homogeneous morphology and small particle size were systematically prepared by a solvothermal method. The crystal structure, surface morphology and catalytic performance of MCo2O4 were adjusted by the special co-solvent isopropanol and glycerol, exhibiting a regular and uniform spherical structure with an average diameter of 900 nm. The surface of MCo2O4 before calcination is wrapped with a layer of a fold-like substance, which is related to the addition of glycerol. XRD results show that BaCo2O4 was firstly prepared by this method in this study. Finally, the catalytic decomposition performance of MCo2O4 composites toward ammonium perchlorate (AP) and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) was investigated and compared via the DSC method. BaCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 exhibit the best catalytic activity toward AP and RDX, respectively, which is mainly due to their higher crystallinity and the better catalytic activity of copper ions. The simple and high-yield pathway for obtaining nano-MCo2O4 in this work provides a new insight to design and develop a kind of high-performance combustion catalyst for solid propellants.",2021
Stabilizers for nitrate ester-based energetic materials and their mechanism of action: a state-of-the-art review,"Aliphatic nitrate esters are currently the most widely used energetic ingredients in single-, double-, and triple-base propellants. These nitrate esters are unstable at ambient conditions, and stabilizing agents should be incorporated into the energetic compositions to inhibit and slow down the decomposition reactions that can occur. However, the currently used stabilizers present a number of environmental and human health issues. To overcome these shortcomings, many stabilizers have been appeared in the past few decades and continue to be developed. Furthermore, several analytical techniques have been introduced to monitor the stability of nitrate ester-based energetic materials as well, since the existing ones could not be efficiently applied. Therefore, this review paper discusses and summarizes the current and emergent stabilizers as well as their mechanisms of action. A critical and analytical examination of their advantages and drawbacks is made.",2018
Construction of a series of insensitive energetic materials starting from the condensation reaction of 3-amino-4-cyanofurazan,"Multicyclic compounds containing a 1,2,5-oxadiazole core exhibit high density and excellent thermal stability due to their 3,4-substitution arrangement, which facilitates attaining a planar conformation. In this work, a series of new compounds (2-5) that consist of 1,2,5-oxadiazoles bonded to other heterocycles or modifiable groups via stable C-C bonds are synthesized through condensation reactions of 3-amino-4-cyanofurazan. Then their 14 energetic derivatives were developed. The synthesis methods and chemistry involved in the production of these novel energetic materials have been explained. The new compounds were investigated through IR, NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The thermal decomposition temperatures of the samples were determined using thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry and found to range from 136 degrees C to 345 degrees C (onset). Furthermore, the results of impact and friction testing showed that these compounds exhibited greater insensitivity compared to FOX-12. Detonation properties, densities, and heats of formation were determined through the EXPLO5 v6.05.04 program, a gas pycnometer, and the Born-Haber energy cycle, respectively. The combination of good detonation properties, enhanced thermal stabilities, and low sensitivities indicates that certain compounds (8, 9, 12, 14, and 16) could be promising contenders for insensitive energetic uses. Interestingly 6-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5,7-diamine (7) displays fluorescence, making it a promising option for usage as an energetic filler or in the production of energetic materials to facilitate easy detection. A library of energetic materials synthesized from 3-amino-4-cyanofurazan has been disclosed, in which compound 7 is a unique example of an energetic compound with fluorescence, which opens the door for many new applications.",2024
Prediction of Probabilistic Shock Initiation Thresholds of Energetic Materials Through Evolution of Thermal-Mechanical Dissipation and Reactive Heating,"The ignition threshold of an energetic material (EM) quantifies the macroscopic conditions for the onset of self-sustaining chemical reactions. The threshold is an important theoretical and practical measure of material attributes that relate to safety and reliability. Historically, the thresholds are measured experimentally. Here, we present a new Lagrangian computational framework for establishing the probabilistic ignition thresholds of heterogeneous EM out of the evolutions of coupled mechanical-thermal-chemical processes using mesoscale simulations. The simulations explicitly account for microstructural heterogeneities, constituent properties, and interfacial processes and capture processes responsible for the development of material damage and the formation of hotspots in which chemical reactions initiate. The specific mechanisms tracked include viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, fracture, post-fracture contact, frictional heating, heat conduction, reactive chemical heating, gaseous product generation, and convective heat transfer. To determine the ignition threshold, the minimum macroscopic loading required to achieve self-sustaining chemical reactions with a rate of reactive heat generation exceeding the rate of heat loss due to conduction and other dissipative mechanisms is determined. Probabilistic quantification of the processes and the thresholds are obtained via the use of statistically equivalent microstructure sample sets (SEMSS). The predictions are in agreement with available experimental data.",2021
"Initial mechanisms for the decomposition of electronically excited energetic materials: 1,5′-BT, 5,5′-BT, and AzTT","Decomposition of nitrogen-rich energetic materials 1,5'-BT, 5,5'-BT, and AzTT (1,5'-Bistetrazole, 5,5'-Bistetrazole, and 5-(5-azido-(1 or 4)H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)tetrazole, respectively), following electronic state excitation, is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The N-2 molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from the three materials, subsequent to UV excitation, with a cold rotational temperature (<30 K). Initial decomposition mechanisms for these three electronically excited materials are explored at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF(12,8)/6-31G(d) level illustrate that conical intersections play an essential role in the decomposition mechanism. Electronically excited S-1 molecules can non-adiabatically relax to their ground electronic states through (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersections. 1,5'-BT and 5,5'-BT materials have several (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersections between S-1 and S-0 states, related to different tetrazole ring opening positions, all of which lead to N-2 product formation. The N-2 product for AzTT is formed primarily by N-N bond rupture of the -N-3 group. The observed rotational energy distributions for the N-2 products are consistent with the final structures of the respective transition states for each molecule on its S-0 potential energy surface. The theoretically derived vibrational temperature of the N-2 product is high, which is similar to that found for energetic salts and molecules studied previously. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",2015
Detection of anionic energetic material residues in enhanced fingermarks on porous and non-porous surfaces using ion chromatography,"The ability to link criminal activity and identity using validated analytical approaches can be of great value to forensic scientists. Herein, the factors affecting the recovery and detection of inorganic and organic energetic material residues within chemically or physically enhanced fingermarks on paper and glass substrates are presented using micro-bore anion exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity detection. Fingermarks on both surfaces were enhanced using aluminium powder or ninhydrin after spiking with model test mixtures or through contact with black-powder substitutes. A quantitative study of the effects of environmental/method interferences, the sweat matrix, the surface and the enhancement technique on the relative anion recovery of forensically relevant species is presented. It is shown that the analytical method could detect target analytes at the nanogram level even within excesses of enhancement reagents and their reaction products when using solid phase extraction and/or microfiltration. To our knowledge, this work demonstrates for the first time that ion chromatography can detect anions in energetic materials within fingermarks on two very different surfaces, after operational enhancement techniques commonly used by forensic scientists and police have been applied.

"Compatibility study of dihydroxylammonium 3,3'-dinitroamino-4,4'-azoxyfurazanate with some energetic materials applied in solid propellant","In this paper, chemical compatibility between dihydroxylammonium 3,3'-dinitroamino-4,4'-azoxyfurazanate (HOF) and some energetic components applied in solid propellant is explored via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vacuum stability test (VST). DSC results show that HOF was compatible with NC, BAMO-GAP, GAP, HMX, CL-20, DNTF, NTO-Pb, Al powder, and Mg powder according to a modified evaluated standard of DSC. However, absorbentia (NC + NG) and RDX were both sensitive with HOF, while binary mixture of HOF and DINA was incompatible. After heating at 90 A degrees C for 40 h, net gas evolution of binary mixtures, such as HOF/NC, HOF/absorbentia, HOF/BAMO-GAP, HOF/DINA, HOF/RDX, was 0.04, 0.84, -0.50, 6.62, and 7.23 mL, respectively, when compared to single HOF sample. VST result further identifies that HOF was simultaneously compatible with NC and BAMO-GAP, but did moderately interact with absorbentia. It is found that DINA and RDX are both incompatible with HOF, which means they are not allowed to store with HOF for a long time.",2017
Detection of explosives - Studies on thermal decomposition patterns of energetic materials by means of chemical and physical sensors,"The present study investigates the feasibility of library free discrimination between energetic and non energetic materials, based on the behavior of the substance rather than its chemical composition. This allows the evaluation of explosion hazard even for novel, previously not encountered materials. The setup is designed for solid samples in the lowest milligram range and utilizes rapid heating for thermal activation of the analyte. The reaction is monitored by a pressure sensor, photodiodes and metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Key features are the application of readily available physical and chemical sensors, utilization of ambient air as a carrier gas, regulation of sample weight by the geometry of the heater and easily understandable read out. The acquired data from physical sensors is analyzed for specific thresholds to separate high reactive energetic materials and propellants. The remaining analytes are investigated with MOX gas sensors in the second step to discriminate less reactive energetic materials from benign ones. The rate of correct assignments for the developed setup is 93,2% with a total of 11 false negatives and 2 false positives out of 190 experiments.

We applied the nitrogen nuclear quadrupole resonance (N-14 NQR) spectroscopy as a method to examine some physical and chemical properties of 5-aminotetrazole and 5-aminotetrazole monohydrate. N-14 NQR frequencies and spin-lattice relaxation times were measured at different temperatures between 77K and 300K. Five NQR triplets v(+), v(-) and v(0) were found for the five in-equivalent nitrogen atoms in each compound between 0.7MHz and 4MHz. Carr-Purcell based multi-pulse sequences were used to accumulate quadrupole echo signals before the FFT analysis.

"Impact of regiochemistry in energetic materials science: a case of (nitratomethyl-1,2,3-triazolyl)furazans","The preparation of multipurpose high-energy materials for space technologies remains a challenging task and such materials usually require special precautions and fine tunability of their functional properties. To unveil new opportunities en route to high-performance energetic materials, novel potential melt-castable explosives and energetic plasticizers incorporating a (1,2,3-triazolyl)furazan scaffold enriched with nitro and nitratomethyl explosophoric functionalities were synthesized. The successful implementation of the regiodivergent approach enabled the preparation of regioisomeric (nitratomethyltriazolyl)furazans that possessed significantly different physicochemical properties classifying the target materials as melt-castable substances or energetic plasticizers.

Toward the defect engineering of energetic materials: A review of the effect of crystal defects on the sensitivity,"Defects always exist in the applied energetic materials (EMs) and have a vital influence on ignition mechanism and further sensitivity. The defect engineering of EMs aims to obtain the understandings of defect effects on properties and performances and use these understandings to create new EMs to satisfy the specified requirements. This article reviews the effect of crystal defects on the sensitivity with a wide range, i.e., the defects include various types, such as point defect (vacancy, orientational defect and element doping), line defect (dislocation), planar defect (twin, shear band, crack and surface defect) and volume defect (void); and four types of sensitivities are covered, including shock sensitivity, impact sensitivity, thermal stability and laser sensitivity. In addition, we summarize the origin of the defect-induced enhancement of sensitivity, as that the molecules of defects possess thermodynamic and kinetic advantages in the external stimuli induced decomposition over those in the perfect bulk. Besides, we present a perspective of the defect engineering of EMs, in which the structure-activity relationship and the efficient creation and use of defects are put forward.",2022
Miro-hotspot model for the laser initiation of explosive decomposition of energetic materials with melting taken into account,"In this paper, we study a micro-hotspot model for the laser initiation of explosive decomposition taking into account the melting of the matrix of the energetic material and the nanometallic inclusion contained in its volume. The heating features of the nanoparticle in an inert matrix are investigated, and the dependence of the maximum temperature on the surface of the inclusion on its radius is constructed. It is shown that melting leads to a reduction in the maximum heating temperature and a slight change in the radius of the most heated nanoparticle. The dependences of the critical initiation energy density of explosive decomposition of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) with aluminum nanoparticles on the inclusion radius with and without melting are calculated. With melting taken into account, the model gives higher critical initiation energy density of explosive decomposition. In the case of inclusions of large radius, the formation of the reaction site of explosive decomposition occurs before complete melting of the metal inclusion, which results in solidification of the melt during the induction period.",2014
Impact-induced deformation and ignition related to localized viscous shear flow heating for high-ductility composite energetic materials,"Understanding the impact-induced deformation and ignition properties of high-ductility composite ener-getic material (CEM), including high-energy propellants and casted high explosives, is fundamental to the safety design and usage of rockets and warheads and has been a broad concern in the fields of aerospace and defence. In this study, an impact ignition experiment is designed using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar to quantitate the continuum deformation and reaction responses of a high-ductility CEM sample undergone periodic impact loading pulses. The relation between macroscopic shear deformation rate and localized viscous shear flow heating, melting, and reaction is further investigated utilizing a macro-mesoscopic thermomechanical model. The results show that CEM sample is severely crushed to 2% of the original thickness and laterally extruded with a high shear rate (-105 s-1). High shear deforma-tion rate contributes to the localized viscous shear flow heating, thereby inducing temperature rise spike (-200 K) and following ignition. Ignition of CEM sample occurs in the third compression pulse because the thinner sample exhibits a high velocity gradient, which causes a high viscous shear flow heating rate.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Barium strontium titanate-based perovskite materials from DFT perspective: assessing the structural, electronic, vibrational, dielectric and energetic properties","This paper presents a current theoretical study on structural, electronic, vibrational, dielectric and energetic properties of the pristine cubic and tetragonal barium strontium titanate (BSTc and BSTt), as well as Sn-doped cubic and tetragonal barium strontium titanate (BSTSc and BSTSt) crystals. For this purpose, first-principle calculations within the Density Functional Theory method at the B3LYP level are implemented in the CRYSTAL14 code. Structural and thermodynamic analysis indicates that the change in geometry, as well as the Sn-doping process in BST samples, induces structural defects, which govern its electronic structure, generating singular bandgap values attributed to the perturbation of electronic levels in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Moreover, the vibration analysis was helpful to identify how the Sr and Sn doping process along with the A- and B-site of perovskite structure can affect the structural disorder, mainly for the tetragonal phase. Besides, electron density maps showed that the electronic properties were associated with the presence of [AO(12)] (A=Ba and Sr) and [MO6] (M=Ti and Sn) clusters with distinct bonding character. Furthermore, our structural, vibrational, and electronic calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental data and pave the avenue towards the complete understanding of the overall properties of perovskite materials.",2021
A computational strategy in consideration of the crystal surface structures for the crystal morphology prediction of energetic material,"A computational strategy in consideration of the crystal surface structures was proposed based on the attachment energy model to unravel of the effect of solvent on the crystal morphology. The proposed strategy is confirmed by its successful applications to predict the crystal morphology of FOX-7 growth in DMSO. The analysis results of the binding energy composition between the solvent and the crystal show that the adsorption of DMSO molecules on the surface with nitro groups is mainly through forming hydrogen bonds, whereas the adsorption on the surface with amino groups is mainly due to the van der Waals interaction.",2020
"Shear induced weakening of the hydrogen bonding lattice of the energetic material 5,5′-Hydrazinebistetrazole at high-pressure","5,5'-Hydrazinebistetrazole (HBTA) has been studied by in-situ x-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy to pressures near 25 GPa at room temperature. Analysis of the x-ray diffraction pattern of HBTA collected at ambient pressure and temperature revealed a monoclinic structure consistent with that previously reported. Under compression, the x-ray diffraction reveals little evidence of a phase transition over the pressure range studied. Slight anisotropy in response to compression was noted and the beta angle decreased moderately, suggesting geometry modifications occur in the hydrogen bonding lattice and between neighboring HBTA molecules as a result of compression along the c axis. Blue shifts in the Infrared active N-H stretching modes were observed, implying a weakening of the hydrogen bond with compression. The weakening of the hydrogen bonding lattice with pressure may lead to an increase in the bending angle of the C-N = N-C bridge between the tetrazole rings and an increased overlap between the pi-bonding orbitals. The Raman spectra showed a number of modes associated with H-N = N-H motions of the bridge become more prominent in the spectra under compression. Additionally, the possibility that the increased bend in the angle of the C-N = N-C bridge results from a shearing deformation is discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2017

Monte Carlo Simulations of 17.9-22.3 MeV Energetic Proton Irradiation Effects on bcc-Zirconium Fusionic Materials,"Advanced fusion structural materials (FSMs) have impact role in terms of efficiency of nuclear energy production. Besides engineering and design of fusion reactors, radiation durability of FSMs is another valuable issue that cannot be ignored. 17.9-22.3 MeV proton irradiation of bcc-Zirconium Fusion Structural Material was evaluated by using Monte Carlo based simulation tools. Total binary reaction cross sections were respectively calculated as 1167.6 and 1273.92 mb for 17.3- and 22.3 MeV proton energies via TALYS-1.6 version. Additionally, residual production cross sections and total particle production cross sections were obtained and analyzed by the TALYS code.

"The High-Pressure Characterization of Melt-Castable Energetic Materials: 3,3′-Bis-Oxadiazole-5,5′-Bis-Methylene Dinitrate","The high-pressure behavior of 3,3 '-bis-oxadiazole-5,5 '-bis-methylene dinitrate (BODN) was studied at room temperature to 25 GPa by Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. The Raman spectra, powder patterns, and calculated unit-cell volumes at selected pressures show qualitative agreement with first-principles density function theory calculations. Over this pressure range, no evidence of polymorphism was observed which suggests that this energetic material can be formulated without the concern of forming lower-density phases at elevated pressures. Vibrational measurements suggest a reversible deformation of the C-C linkage between the oxadiazole rings with increased pressure.",2019
Exploration of the Energetic Material Ammonium Perchlorate at High Pressures: Combined Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction Study,"High-pressure behaviors of ammonium per chlorate (NH4CIO4), a widely used energetic oxidizer, have been investigated using in situ angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy experiments up to 22.0 and 20.4 GPa, respectively. A sluggish structural transformation is identified, which started at similar to 2.4 GPa and completed at similar to 10.6 GPa. The crystal structure of high pressure (phase II) is refined to possess a symmetry of P2. The structural transformation is indicated by the obvious changes in XRD patterns, Raman spectra, and discontinuities of peak positions. Variations in lattice constants and volume of unit cell of the ambient structure (phase I) up to similar to 10.0 GPa are also presented. The compressibility of phase I is anisotropic. The compression ratio of b axis is larger than axes. The bulk modulus of phase I is B-0 = 24.5(4) GPa, and its first pressure derivative is B-0' = 4.5(2). The phase transition is reversible, as the XRD pattern transformed to the initial profile upon release of pressure. On the basis of the Raman and XRD analysis, the high-pressure-induced phase transition of ammonium perchlorate is proposed to be associated with rearrangement of hydrogen-bonded networks.",2018
Host-guest energetic nanocomposites based on self-assembly of multi-nitro organic molecules in nanochannels of mesoporous materials,"Host-guest energetic nanocomposites have been synthesized by self-assembly of the high energy density compound HNIW in nanometer-scale channels of an ordered mesoporous material SBA-15. The complete impregnation of HNIW can be achieved in acetone solvent at ambient temperature, and the maximum amount was around 70 wt%. Structural characterizations were systematically provided by XRD, TEM, N(2) adsorption, TG, (13)C solid-state NMR and FT-IR. The tendency of multi-nitro organic molecules to self-assemble when the solvent evaporated has been described. Hydrogen bond interactions were considered as the main driving force, so the choices of matched host matrix and guest organic compounds were pivotal for implementing this process. The thermal properties of nanocomposites were measured by DSC analysis. Compared with pure HNIW and a physical mixture, the decomposition peak temperature of the confined crystals decreased about 11 degrees C, while the total amount of heat released slightly increased. This strategy can also be expanded to other similar host-guest systems.",2011
"Expanding the Limits of Organic Energetic Materials: High-Performance Alliance of 1,3,4-Thiadiazole and Furazan Scaffolds","A majority of known and newly synthesized energetic materials comprise polynitrogen or nitrogen-oxygen heterocycles with various explosophores. However, available structural combinations of these organic scaffolds are finite and are about to reach their limits. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of a series of sulfur-containing polyazole structures comprising 1,3,4-thiadiazole and furazan rings linked by C-C bonds and enriched with energetic nitro and azo functionalities. In terms of detonation performance, all synthesized 1,3,4-thiadiazole-furazan assemblies (D = 7.7-7.9 km s(-1); P = 26-28 GPa) lie between the powerful explosive TATB (D = 8.0 km s(-1); P = 31 GPa) and melt-cast material TNT (D = 6.9 km s(-1); P = 23 GPa). In the synthesized series, azo-bridged derivative 5 seems to be most practically interesting, as it combines a relatively high energetic performance (D = 7.9 km s(-1); P = 28 GPa), a very high thermal stability (271 degrees C), and insensitivity to friction. By these functional properties, 5 outperforms the benchmark heat-resistant explosive hexanitrostilbene (HNS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an energetic alliance of furazan and 1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffolds and a rare case of sulfur-containing high-energy materials, which can certainly be considered as an evolutionary step in energetic materials science.",2023
"Bis(3-(trinitromethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)methanone: A mildly acidic high-performing energetic material","High performance, acceptable thermostability, and low mechanical sensitivity are high-demand properties in the design of competitive materials. Nitrogen-rich compounds are an alternative source of green molecules. Two simple, efficient synthetic routes to a novel material, bis (3-(trinitromethyl) - 1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl) methanone, 5, by using inexpensive starting compounds are described.

The theoretical densities and Explo5 calculations of solvent-free molecules, 5 and 5a, suggest that expanding the functionality of carbonyl-bridged compounds may be an alternative way to achieve high-performing materials.",2022
Density Functional Theory Study of the High-Pressure Characterization of Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Materials: Bis-Triaminoguanidinium Azotetrazolate (TAGzT),"Using density functional theory calculations, the structural, electronic, and absorption properties of the promising nitrogen-rich energetic compound bis-triaminoguanidinium azotetrazolate (TAGzT) under hydrostatic compression of 0-50 GPa are investigated. The results show that TAGzT has a structural transition at the pressure of 29.4 GPa. The results also show that the compressibility of TAGzT is anisotropic, and its structure is much stiffer in the b direction. Analysis of electronic properties shows that TAGzT transforms into a metallic system at 29.4 GPa due to the structural transition, where TAGzT becomes more sensitive under the pressure compression. The absorption spectra indicate that TAGzT has higher transparency in the infrared region and high optical activity in UV light, and its optical activity increases as pressure increases. This study may provide useful information for understanding how TAGzT behaves under high pressure.",2021
Optimizing the oxygen balance by changing the A-site cations in molecular perovskite high-energetic materials,"We presented two new members of molecular perovskite high-energetic materials, (H(2)pz)[Na(ClO4)(3)] (PAP-1) and (H(2)dabco-O)[K(ClO4)(3)] (DAP-O2), in which H(2)pz(2+) (piperazine-1,4-diium) and H(2)dabco-O2+ (1-hydroxy-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium) act as A-site fuel cations, respectively. Compared with their H(2)dabco(2+) analogues, (H(2)dabco)[M(ClO4)(3)] (H(2)dabco(2+) = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium, M = Na+ for DAP-1 and K+ for DAP-2, respectively), PAP-1 and DAP-O2 exhibit optimized oxygen balance by employing two strategies to change the A-site cations, i.e., trimming the C and H atoms of H(2)dabco(2+) by using H(2)pz(2+) to form PAP-1 and adding an O atom into H(2)dabco(2+) by using H(2)dabco-O2+ to form DAP-O2, respectively. As suggested by DFT calculations and the K-J equation, the smaller H(2)pz(2+) cation in PAP-1 gives a significantly-optimized oxygen balance from -22.0% to -3.9% and an increased crystal density from 2.02 to 2.07 g cm(-3), resulting in a better detonation performance for PAP-1. Meanwhile the larger H(2)dabco-O2+ cation gives a slightly-optimized oxygen balance from -21.3% to -17.1% but a decreased crystal density from 2.04 to 1.98 g cm(-3), leading to a decreased detonation performance from DAP-2 to DAP-O2. This study demonstrated how to rationally choose the A-site cations in a perovskite structure for modulating the properties of molecular perovskite high-energetic materials, providing important clues for designing more advanced energetic materials for practical use.",2018
Experimentally-validated mesoscale modeling of the coupled mechanical-thermal response of AP-HTPB energetic material under dynamic loading,"This manuscript presents a combined computational-experimental study of the mesoscale thermo-mechanical behavior of the Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) bonded ammonium perchlorate (AP) composite energetic material subjected to dynamic loading conditions. The computational model considers the AP-HTPB interface debonding, post-debonding interface friction and temperature rise due to viscoelastic dissipation as well as dissipative interfacial processes. The interface is modeled using a cohesive zone model combined with a contact algorithm to account for the interface separation, particle/binder contact and heat generation.

Chlorination of glyoxime with Cl2 gas in ethanol and following chloro/azido exchange yields diazidoglyoxime, which is cyclized under acidic conditions (HCl gas in diethyl ether) to give 1H,1H-5,5-bitetrazole-1,1-diol dihydrate (1). A large variety of nitrogen-rich salts of 1 such as the diammonium (2), the dihydrazinium (3), the bis-guanidinium (4), the bis(aminoguanidinium) (5), the diaminoguanidinium salt monohydrate (6), the triaminoguanidinium salt monohydrate (7), the 1-amino-3-nitroguanidinium salt dihydrate (8), the diaminouronium salt monohydrate (9), the bis(oxalyldihydrazidinium) (10), the oxalyldihydrazidinium salt dihydrate (11), the 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazinium (12), the 5-aminotetrazolium (13), the bis(5-amino-1-methyl-1H-tetrazolium) salt (14), the bis(5-amino-2-methyl-2H-tetrazole) adduct (15), and the 1,5-diaminotetrazolium salt (16) were synthesized by means of BrOnsted acidbase or metathesis reactions. All compounds were fully characterized by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The crystal structures of 116 could be determined by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The heats of formation of 116 were calculated by using the atomization method on the basis of CBS-4M enthalpies. With regard to their potential use as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) or hexanitrostilbene (HNS) replacements, several detonation parameters such as the detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosion energy, and explosion temperature were computed using the EXPLO5 code on the basis of the experimental (X-ray) densities and calculated heats of formation. In addition, the sensitivities towards impact, friction, and electrical discharge were tested using the BAM drop hammer, a friction tester, as well as a small-scale electrical discharge device.",2013

Simple eutectic behaviors for these systems were observed. The experimental results were correlated by means of original and modified NRTL, Wilson, and UNIQUAC equations. The root-mean-square deviations of the solubility temperatures for all measured data vary from 0.63 K to 3.73 K and depend on the particular model used. The best solubility correlation was obtained with the UNIQUAC model.",2013
Phytoremediation for the treatment of energetic material releases on testing and training ranges at Eglin Air Force Base,"In order to protect natural resources and ecosystems at Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB), a strategy must be developed for the containment and/or treatment of explosive contaminants on testing and training ranges under continuous use. Phytoremediation is the direct use of living plants for in situ (in place) remediation of contaminated soil, sludges, sediments, and groundwater through contaminant removal, degradation, or containment.

Effect of the curvature of the burning surface on the burning rate of a solid homogeneous energetic material,"The dependence of the burning rate of a solid homogeneous energetic material on curvature of the burning surface is investigated theoretically and experimentally. For these purposes, we use wedge-shaped samples with different apex angles which allow realizing the curved burning surface with a controlled curvature.

Energetic and exergetic performance assessment of the inclusion of phase change materials (PCM) in a solar distillation system,"In this experimental work, the energetic and exergetic performance enhancement of solar distillation system (solar still incorporated with PCM storage unit) is performed by using two techniques. First, pin fins heat sink (PF) is embedded inside the PCM to act as a thermal conductivity enhancer. Second, black steel mesh fibers (SWF) are employed in the solar still basin with PCM. In this regard, four cases of the solar stills are studied and compared conventional still: conventional solar still (without PCM), still with PCM (With PCM), still with PCM and pin fins heat sink embedded in the PCM (With PCM-PF) and still with PCM and SWF in the basin (With PCM-SWF). The energetic and exergetic performance of the four cases is evaluated and compared under the meteorological conditions of New Borg El-Arab City, Egypt. The results show that the total daily cumulative yield of distilled water of still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF are greater than of conventional still by 9.5%, 16.8%, and 13%, respectively. Additionally, the inclusion of the fins heat sink in the PCM increases the average daily energy and exergy efficiencies by 17.9, and 13.2%, respectively compared to conventional one. Likewise, the energy and exergy efficiencies of still with PCM-PF are higher than those of solar still with PCM by 7.7 and, 6.8%, respectively. Furthermore, placing SWF in the basin of still with PCM significantly enhances the daytime energy and exergy efficiencies with a considerable reduction of these values in the nighttime. The total daily evaporative exergy for still with PCM-SWF is greater than those of conventional still, still with PCM, and still with PCM-PF by 13, 8, and 2%, respectively. Also, still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF exhibit an increment of the daily exergy efficiency 5.9, 13.2, and 17.3%, respectively compared to still without PCM. Still with PCM-PF achieved the highest accumulated daily water productivity and energy efficiency but still with PCM-SWF attained the highest daily exergy efficiency with nearly no additional cost.",2019
Thermal characterization of acetone peroxide mixtures with high energetic materials and Raman based detection of concealed chemical threats,"This study was aimed at making contributions toward the understanding and detection of homemade explosives (HME). The properties and interactions between components in a blend of energetic materials with acetone peroxide, powerful and unstable homemade explosives, were studied by thermal analysis, spectroscopic tools and by the use of computational methods. First, the thermal stability of triacetone triperoxide (AP), a HME, was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The enthalpy of sublimation and the activation energy for decomposition were obtained by kinetics analysis and modeling. The results were compared to other known energetic materials. The relationship between structure and thermal behavior was also studied. Then, AP was combined with other energetic materials. The spectroscopic signatures of these systems and the thermal decomposition curves of such blends were reported. Computational analysis was used to estimate interaction energies for possible conformations. Also, as part of the contributed work, Raman spectroscopy was evaluated as a detection tool for concealed hazardous materials. Liquid explosives, chemical warfare agent stimulants and toxic industrial compounds were analyzed by fiber optic coupled and standoff detection Raman systems. The liquids were concealed within consumer products such as beverages and personal care products.",2009
"Functionalization of fused imidazole-oxadiazole, triazole-oxadiazole and tetrazole-oxadiazole skeletons: Search for stable and potential energetic materials","In this study, 21 energetic molecules were designed based on imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]oxadiazole, [1,2,4]triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4]oxadiazole, and [1,3,4]oxadiazolo[3,2-d]tetrazole fused heterocyclic backbones by inserting -NH2, -N-3, -NO2, -NHNO2, -ONO2, -CH(NO2)(2), and -C(NO2)(3) functional groups. These compounds have high densities and excellent detonation performance. Among them, compounds with -NO2, -NHNO2, -ONO2, -CH(NO2)(2), and -C(NO2)(3) substituents showed satisfactory detonation velocities (D > 8.70 km/s) and pressures (P > 35.2 GPa), which are equivalent to the performance of RDX and HMX. The analysis of energy gap (Delta E) in frontier molecular orbitals, free volume (Delta V) in a crystalline unit cell, maximum heat of detonation (Q), and percentage positive electrostatic potential reveal their moderate sensitivity. Combined with high nitrogen content, good density, energy content, and stability, imidazole-oxadiazole, triazole-oxadiazole, and tetrazoleoxadiazole [5 + 5] fused heterocyclic backbones will facilitate the preparation and development of new energetic materials.",2023
"Multi-Scale Modeling of Heterogeneous Energetic Materials in Three Roles: <strong>Prediction, Deduction</strong> and <strong>Induction</strong>","Formulations of energetic materials rely on intrinsic (molecular) structure of a particular nitramine (CHNO) compound to engineer their responses to shocks. Based on decades of empirical data some of the most commonly used energetic materials (EMs) can be arranged in a hierarchy of sensitivity; from the most insensitive TATB, useful to prevent accidental initiation in storage, handling and transportation to the most sensitive compound PETN, used to trigger charges. Book-ended by these two compounds are a variety of other CHNO species with varying degrees of sensitivity. In multi-scale predictive models of shock-to-detonation transition (SDT), microstructure-aware burn models are employed to connect meso-scale hotspot dynamics with macro-scale energy release. Meso-scale calculations of hotspot ignition and growth rely on chemical reaction rates expressed in Arrhenius forms; these chemical kinetics models therefore are foundational to the construction of physics-based, simulation-derived meso-informed closure (reactive burn) models. However, even for well-studied energetic materials such as HMX, the reaction time scales and pathways provided by available reaction kinetic schemes vary widely. For practical, predictive calculations of SDT in HMX-based energetic materials (EM), uncertainties in reaction rate parameters can amplify to produce large uncertainties in predicted initiation envelopes, such as James curves or Pop-plots. In this thesis, the multiscale model or the meso-informed ignition and growth (MES-IG) model which allows for connecting meso-scale hotspot dynamics to macro-scale shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) was used to perform a forward prediction of sensitivity to bound reaction chemistry models. Three global Arrhenius-form rate models that span the range of reaction time scales, namely the Tarver 3-equation, the Henson 1-equation and the Menikoff 1-equation models. The ability of the three reaction models to reproduce experimentally observed sensitivity is assessed by comparing the predicted criticality envelope (Walker-Wasley curve) with experimental data for pressed HMX Class V microstructures. The forward model tells you the chemistry models for HMX should be in the vicinity of Henson1 Tarver3 models. To better pin down reaction rate parameters for HMX, we perform an inverse analysis (deduction) to extract the rate constants in an Arrhenius model (assuming a single reaction global kinetics model) that best predicts an experimentally obtained criticality (James) envelope for a neat-pressed HMX material for which the microstructure is well characterized. Interestingly, the estimated global kinetic scheme is shown to conform to a previously proposed global kinetics model, i.e., the well-known Henson 1-equation model. To establish the validity of the inverse analysis, we further carry out a forward analysis using the determined reaction rate law and demonstrate good predictions of the Pop-plot for a different class of pressed HMX material. While the inverse analysis has been applied herein to HMX, this presents a general route to arrive at global kinetics models that can be applied to a wide class of EM species. We can explore the possibility of developing techniques to accelerate the calculation of sensitivity envelopes for the general class of CHNO materials. Such a technique would be highly beneficial in the prediction and design of EMs and their formulations. Therefore, we use the knowledge gained from single energetic species (HMX) for Induction: generalizing surrogate models for energy localization across CHNO species through Transfer Learning. In order to guide the accelerated development of meso-informed multiscale models for other HE species a multi output convolution gaussian process technique was used which uses the metamodel generated for neat pressed HMX as the foundation to obtain the generic response hypersurfaces F CHNO . These low fidelity F CHNO are then corrected using sparse DNS simulations in order to develop a high fidelity metamodel for each CHNO, eg. TATB and RDX. This process of transfer learning provides a route for rapid estimations of shock sensitivity for a wide range of species across the CHNO family.",2023
"Study on the Thermal Stability of Octogen and other Energetic Materials (RDX, TNT, NQ, PBT, TDI and HTPB)","The Octogen (HMX) and other energetic materials, such as Hexogen (RDX), Trinitrotoluene (TNT), Nitroguanidine (NQ), Polybutylene terephthalate Glycol Ester (PBT), Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), and Hydroxy-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) were subjected to linear heating tests by a Microcalorimeter (C600), to obtain thermal decomposition curves. Based on this data, the thermal stability was studied experimentally and theoretically. The decomposition peak and melting peak of RDX were coupled, and the time to reach the maximum weight loss increased with the increase of heating rates. Within a certain experimental error range, the apparent activation energy calculated by different methods was basically consistent in a larger conversion rate range. The thermal stability of other energetic materials, such as RDX, TNT, NQ, PBT, TDI and HTPB in the mixed system of HMX were explored. The results revealed that HMX had salient thermal stability with RDX, PBT and TDI. However, the thermal stability of HMX mixed with TNT, NQ, HTPB and other substances was poor, which promoted the thermal decomposition of each other, resulting in the decrease of thermal decomposition temperature and further decrease of thermal safety of the mixed system. Therefore, HMX should not be placed in the same place as TNT, NQ and HTPB in the actual application process.",2020
"3,6-Dinitropyrazolo[4,3-","A family of 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole-based energetic compounds was synthesized by using versatile N-functionalization strategies.

Surface structural and energetic heterogeneity of carbon materials prepared from corn grains using steam and H,"The porous activated carbons (ACs) were prepared from corn grains through physical (steam) and chemical-physical (H3PO4-steam) activations. The effects of steam activation temperature (700-900 degrees C) on pore development, surface roughness, and energetic heterogeneity were investigated in both activations. Also, the effect of prior carbonization on H3PO4-steam activation was studied. The physical properties, surface fractal dimensions, and adsorption energy distributions of ACs were determined from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm data. Both physical and chemical-physical activations show that the AC with higher surface area, relatively smoother surface, and energetically heterogeneous surface could be produced at a maximum steam activation temperature (900 degrees C).

"Biotechnological production of 1,2,4-butanetriol: An efficient process to synthesize energetic material precursor from renewable biomass","1,2,4-Butanetriol BT) is a valuable chemical with extensive applications in many different fields. The traditional chemical routes to synthesize BT suffer from many drawbacks, e. g., harsh reaction conditions, multiple steps and poor selectivity, limiting its industrial production. In this study, an engineered Escherichia coli strain was constructed to produce BT from xylose, which is a major component of the lignocellulosic biomass. Through the coexpression of a xylose dehydrogenase (CCxylB) and a xylonolactonase (xylC) from Caulobacter crescentus, native E. coli xylonate dehydratase (yjhG), a 2-keto acid decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida (mdlC) and native E. coli aldehyde reductase (adhP) in E. coli BL21 star(DE3), the recombinant strain could efficiently convert xylose to BT. Furthermore, the competitive pathway responsible for xylose metabolism in E. coli was blocked by disrupting two genes (xylA and EcxylB) encoding xylose isomerase and xyloluse kinase. Under fed-batch conditions, the engineered strain BL21 Delta xylAB/pE-mdlCxylBC&pA-adhPyjhG produced up to 3.92 g/L of BT from 20 g/L of xylose, corresponding to a molar yield of 27.7%. These results suggest that the engineered E. coli has a promising prospect for the large-scale production of BT.",2015
Multiscale damage evolution and fracture for thermal aging energetic material based on mesoscopic observation and molecular dynamics simulation,"As a composite energetic material composed of filler and matrix, the mechanical properties of HTPB propellants change constantly due to the aging of each component and component interfaces during long-term storage. However, the study of a single component or performance parameter limits disclosure of the complex aging mechanism and mechanical property evolution. Therefore, based on accelerated thermal aging experiments, this study integrated gas detection, contact angle testing, in situ loading experiments, digital image correlation numerical analysis, and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations to explore the underlying mechanism of structural morphology and mechanical property changes during propellant aging. The results showed that the aging reaction was dominated by degradation chain breaking in the early stage and oxidative crosslinking in the later stage. Degradation chain breaking enhanced interfacial bonding between the two phases, while oxidative crosslinking deteriorated interfacial bonding. Compared with lossless specimens, short-term thermal aging weakened the strength of the matrix and enhanced bonding interfaces. During in situ loading, interfacial pore expansion and matrix damage and fracture occurred simultaneously and the matrix became the key damage source. However, with the extension of thermal aging time, the strength of the matrix increased, bonding interface weakened, and bonding interfaces became a weak point of loading. This made the high-strain area change from the matrix at the initial loading stage to the bonding interface and the damage of the bonding interface caused whole fracture of the specimen. The external loading resulted in the rearrangement of interfacial molecular chains, change of molecular spacing, and initiation and expansion of micropores between molecular chains. The tractor-separation curve conformed to the exponential cohesion model and the damage mode of the interface layer changed between adhesion and cohesion due to thermal aging.",2024
Nitrogen-centered radical reaction leading to energetic materials: a mild and efficient access to N-N bridged compounds,"A radical reaction is a type of highly efficient organic reaction with a broad coverage in organic synthesis. However, its potential in the preparation of energetic materials is grossly underexplored. Now a novel nitrogen-centered radical reaction was discovered which features an N-N coupling capability, able to couple a pyrazole-based energetic compound to its N-N bridged dimer. The reaction exhibits high efficiency, while maintaining the traits of being mild, green, and facile without assistance from metal catalysis, photolysis, electrolysis or pyrolysis. The radical reaction mechanism was verified by a radical scavenger experiment and electron spin resonance spectroscopy.",2021
"Combinations of furoxan and 1,2,4-oxadiazole for the generation of high performance energetic materials","Several energetic materials, which are composed of furoxan and 1,2,4-oxadiazole backbones, were synthesized by nitrating 3,3 '-bis(5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-4,4 '-azofuroxan (2) under 100 wt% HNO3 or 100 wt% HNO3/Ac2O followed by a cation metathesis. All synthesized compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, while 3,3 '-bis(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one-3-yl)-4,4 '-azofuroxan (3) and diammonium 3,3 '-bis(5-nitramino-1,2,4-oxadiazole-3-yl)-4,4 '-azofuroxan (4a) were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical and energetic properties of these compounds including density, thermal stability and sensitivity were investigated. Compounds 3 and 4 have high densities (3: 1.90 g cm(-3), 4: 1.92 g cm(-3)), which are comparable to that of HMX (1.91 g cm(-3)). All energetic compounds show relatively high calculated heat of formation in the range from 504.79 kJ mol(-1) to 1405.62 kJ mol(-1). Their detonation properties were evaluated by EXPLO5 code using the measured density and calculated heat of formation. Among them, compounds 3 and 4 have good detonation performance (3: D = 8891 m s(-1), P = 34.7 GPa, 4: D = 9505 m s(-1), P = 41.3 GPa) and acceptable sensitivities (3: IS = 10 J, 4: IS = 4 J), which indicate their potential applications as high-performance energetic materials.",2019
Generation of Electrohydraulic Shock Waves by Plasma-Ignited Energetic Materials: III. Shock Wave Characteristics With Three Discharge Loads,"As an important plasma-assisted technology to generate shock waves (SWs), underwater pulsed discharge has drawn much attention in recent years for its complex physical process. Based on three discharge loads, the water gap (WG) load, the electrical wire (EW) load, and the energetic material (EM) load, the discharge processes are briefly introduced and the characteristics of the associated SWs are analyzed. First, the experimental setups were built and typical structures of the three loads were presented. Second, the inherent characteristics of SWs under the three loads, such as their peak pressure, impulse, and time duration of positive pressure and power spectral density (PSD), were studied and compared. Finally, a cracking effect experiment is carried out to study the SW fracturing characteristics. The results show that SWs generated with the WG load have the lowest peak pressure, impulse, and power density, SWs generated with the EW load have a better energy conversion efficiency and the largest peak pressure, and SWs generated with the EM load have the maximum impulse and power density. Furthermore, SW fracturing characteristics are mainly affected by its inherent characteristics. The peak pressure and impulse determine the shock number of fracturing, and the fracture pattern is significantly affected by the PSD.",2015
Dinitroazetidines Are a Novel Class of Anticancer Agents and Hypoxia-Activated Radiation Sensitizers Developed from Highly Energetic Materials,"In an effort to develop cancer therapies that maximize cytotoxicity, while minimizing unwanted side effects, we studied a series of novel compounds based on the highly energetic heterocyclic scaffold, dinitroazetidine. In this study, we report the preclinical validation of 1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitroazetidine (ABDNAZ), a representative lead compound currently in a phase I clinical trial in patients with cancer. In tumor cell culture, ABDNAZ generated reactive free radicals in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, modulating intracellular redox status and triggering apoptosis. When administered to mice as a single agent, ABDNAZ exhibited greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin or tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions. However, compared with cisplatin, ABDNAZ was better tolerated at submaximal doses, yielding significant tumor growth inhibition in the absence of systemic toxicity. Similarly, when combined with radiation, ABDNAZ accentuated antitumor efficacy along with the therapeutic index. Toxicity studies indicated that ABDNAZ was not myelosuppressive and no dose-limiting toxicity was apparent following daily administration for 14 days. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof-of-concept for ABDNAZ as a promising new anticancer agent with a favorable toxicity profile, either as a chemotherapeutic agent or a radiosensitizer.

Regulating the Thermal Stability and Energy of Fused-Ring Energetic Materials by Hydrazo Bridging and Hydrogen-Bonding Networks,"Inthis work, a combined strategy of bridging two tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine rings and introducing intramolecular hydrogenbonds (N-H center dot center dot center dot O) with a hydrazo group was developedto construct a new high-energy and heat-resistant energetic compoundnamed 6,6 '-hydrazo-bis(8-amino-7-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine) (1). Its dehydrogenated derivative6,6 '-azo-bis(8-amino-7-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine) (2), which had fewer intramolecular hydrogenbonds (N-H center dot center dot center dot O), was also synthesized for comparison.Compounds 1 and 2 were characterized byhigh-resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, single-crystalX-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.Their properties, such as densities (rho: 1.87 g center dot cm(-3) for 1, 1.77 g center dot cm(-3) for 2), heat of formation values (Delta H (f): 1079 kJ center dot mol(-1) for 1,1235 kJ center dot mol(-1) for 2), detonationvelocities (D (v): 9064 m center dot s(-1) for 1, 8429 m center dot s(-1) for 2), detonation pressures (P: 35.2 GPa for 1, 27.8 GPa for 2), decomposition temperatures(T (d): 292 degrees C for 1, 260 degrees C for 2), impact sensitivities (IS: 16 J for 1, 4 J for 2), and friction sensitivities (FS:>360 N for 1, 160 N for 2), were tested.These results suggest that compound 1 is a promisinghigh-energy and thermally stable energetic material. A combined strategy of hydrazo bridgingand hydrogen-bondingnetwork was developed to construct new high-energy and thermally stableenergetic materials.",2023
Near-GHz scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy for MHz thermometry and H,"This manuscript presents the development of a two-color laser-absorption-spectroscopy (LAS) sensor capable of providing calibration-free measurements of temperature and H2O at 1 MHz in particle-laden combustion environments. This sensor employs scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy with first-harmonic-normalized second-harmonic detection (scanned-WMS-2f/1f) with two distributed-feedback (DFB) tunable diode lasers (TDLs) emitting near 1392 nm and 1469 nm. The wavelength of each laser was modulated at 35 or 45.5 MHz to frequency multiplex the lasers and, more importantly, enable simultaneous wavelength scanning across the peak of each H2O absorption transition at 1 MHz. This method provides an absolute, in situ wavelength reference which improves measurement accuracy and robustness. Methods to characterize the lasers' wavelength and intensity modulation at frequencies above 10 MHz are presented. Measurements of temperature and H2O mole fraction within 0.3-2.5% and 2-10%, respectively, of known values were acquired in a static-gas cell at temperatures of 700-1200 K. The sensor was applied to measure the path-integrated temperature and H2O column density in fireballs produced by igniting 0.75 g of grade 3, class B HMX with and without H-5 micro-aluminum powder (20% by mass). Temperature measurements were acquired in the fireballs with a 1-sigma precision of 50 K, 30 K, and 15 K for measurement rates of 1 MHz, 250 kHz, and 25 kHz, respectively. The results are the first to demonstrate that calibration-free measurements of gas properties can be acquired at 1 MHz using WMS-2f/1f.",2020
Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of the Initial Steps in the Decomposition of a Model Nitramine Energetic Material: Dimethylnitramine,"Decomposition of dimethylnitramine (DMNA, (CH3)(2)NNO2) has been studied extensively over the past decades. Although several different mechanisms have been proposed for the initial decomposition of DMNA, the dominant decomposition channel is still far from fully understood. In this report, we collect all the results reported in the literature, along with our new experimental and theoretical results, into a single reference for a sensible comparison in order to reach a general conclusion on DMNA decomposition. In this effort, nanosecond laser, energy resolved spectroscopy and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations are employed. The parent DMNA molecule is electronically excited using two different UV excitation wavelengths, 226 and 193 rim, to initiate the decomposition process. The NO molecule is observed as a major decomposition product with relatively hot (120 K) rotational and cold vibrational distributions by both time-of-flight mass spectrometry and laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy. On the basis of the experimental observations, a vitro-nitrite isomerization mechanism is predicted to be the major channel of decomposition of DMNA in the excited electronic state with a minor contribution from the HONO elimination mechanism. The branching ratio between vitro-nitrite isomerization and HONO elimination channels is estimated to be approximately 1:0.04. CASSCF calculations show that surface crossing (conical intersection) between upper and lower electronic states along the vitro-nitrite isomerization reaction coordinate plays an important role in the overall decomposition of DMNA. Presence of such m (S-2/S-1)(CI) conical intersection in the vitro-nitrite isomerization reaction coordinate provides a direct nonadiabatic decomposition pathway from the Franck-Condon point of the S-2 surface, which is experimentally accessed by 226 nm photoexcitation. This excited state isomerization takes place through a loose geometry for which the NO, moiety interacts with the (CH3)(2)N moiety from a long distance (similar to 2.8 angstrom); however, in the ground electronic state, a similar (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersection in this vitro-nitrite isomerization reaction coordinate hinders the isomerization exit channel, rendering NO, elimination as the major thermal decomposition channel of DMNA.",2009
Impact of regioisomerism on unimolecular decomposition reactions of energetic materials: Quantum chemistry modeling of ICM-103 and NAPTO,"Energetic regioisomers usually behave different physicochemical properties, and the thermal decomposition mechanism might also be different. In this work, the unimolecular decomposition reactions of two novel energetic isomers, ICM-103 and NAPTO, were investigated through quantum chemistry calculations to reveal the decay mechanism of energetic regioisomers. The molecular properties were first explored to reveal their differences in the molecular properties of ICM-103 and NAPTO. Then, six initial decomposition channels were obtained, including N 2 release of azide group, H transfer, O transfer, nitro dissociation, nitro-nitrite isomerization, and ring-opening reaction. Thermochemistry results show that the most possible decay reaction is the cleavage of N - N bonds of azide group to generate N 2 , and the energy barrier of ICM-103 is lower than that of NAPTO, which is consistent with the conclusion that NAPTO is more stable form the experiment. Specially, two molecules react differently, and a sequential N 2 loss is expected in one, and N 2 O loss in the other is almost lost in the clutter. Besides, the nitro dissociation, nitro-nitrite isomerization, and ring-opening reaction energy of ICM-103 are also lower than that of NAPTO. However, for the other same reaction, the energy barrier of ICM-103 is higher than that of NAPTO. These findings in the initial decomposition pathways of ICM-103 and NAPTO could gain more understanding of the effect of regiochemical control on the thermal stability of energetic materials.",2024
"Self-Assembly of Purines with Oxidants for the Development of Novel, Dense, Insensitive, and Thermally Stable Energetic Materials","Development and production of novel high-performing nitrogen-rich energetic compounds with a safe and environmentally friendly nature are significant in the pursuit of new-generation green energetic materials.

All the salts exhibit good thermal stability (Td: 148-259 degrees C) and mechanical sensitivities (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N), and their detonation velocities range from 7316 to 8655 m center dot s(-1). Compounds 6 and 10 are potential candidates as novel insensitive and heat-resistant explosives because of their high detonation temperatures of 247 and 256 degrees C, good detonation velocities of 8432 and 8523 m center dot s(-1), and good detonation pressures of 25.6 and 26.8 GPa.",2019
"Synthesis of 4,8-Dinitraminodifurazano[3,4-","A series of new energetic compounds based on 4,8-dinitraminodifurazano[3,4-b,e]pyrazine were synthesised and fully characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structures of compounds 3-a, 3-c, 3-f, and 3-g were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The physicochemical and energetic properties of these energetic compounds including density, thermal stability, and energetic performance (e.g., detonation velocities and detonation pressures) were investigated. The combination of nitrogen-rich 4,8-dihydrodifurazano[3,4-b,e]pyrazine framework with highly energetic nitramino moieties endowed these as-synthesised compounds with excellent detonation performance. Among these as-synthesised compounds, five energetic salts (3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 3-f, and 3-g) exhibited satisfactory calculated detonation velocities (8921-9413m s(-1)), which were superior to cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitamine (RDX) (8878m s(-1)). Notably, compound 3-f exhibits an excellent calculated detonation velocity of 9166m s(-1) and also acceptable impact and friction sensitivities (IS=8J, FS=108N). The prominent detonation performance with moderate sensitivities indicates that compound 3-f has the potential to compete with traditional high explosives.",2018

Two novel correlations for assessment of crystal density of hazardous ionic molecular energetic materials using their molecular structures,"This paper introduces two novel simple correlations to assess crystal density of ionic molecular energetic materials as a new class of hazardous high energy density materials. The first one is based on only elemental composition, which can be corrected in the second correlation by two correcting functions on the basis of some molecular fragments in order to include intermolecular interactions. For 100 ionic CHNO molecular systems as training set, the root mean square (rms) percent deviations of predictions for these models relative to experiment are 5.4% and 3.2%, respectively. Corresponding average absolute errors for the new correlations are also 0.077 and 0.042 g/cm(3), respectively. These models have been validated with further the 48 ionic compounds as test set, where the computed results of two complex quantum mechanical models have been reported, which give good results. Moreover, the second revised correlation provides the lowest rms percent deviation and average absolute error of predictions for the tested ionic compounds relative to experiment, i.e., 2.3% and 0.036 g/cm(3), respectively.

"Spectrophotometric and chromatographic determination of insensitive energetic materials: HNS and NTO, in the presence of sensitive nitro-explosives","As there are no molecular spectroscopic determination methods for the most widely used insensitive energetic materials, 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrostilbene (HNS) and 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one (NTO), in the presence of sensitive nitro-explosives, two novel spectrophotometric methods were developed. For HNS and TNT mixtures, both analytes react with dicyclohexylamine (DCHA) forming different colored charge-transfer complexes, which can be resolved by derivative spectroscopy. The spectrophotometric method for NTO measures the 416-nm absorbance of its yellow-colored Na+NTO- salt formed with NaOH. TNT, if present, is pre-extracted into IBMK as its Meisenheimer anion forming an ion-pair with the cationic surfactant cetyl pyridinium (CP+) in alkaline medium, whereas the unextracted NTO is determined in the aqueous phase. The molar absorptivity (epsilon. Lmol(-1) cm(-1)) and limit of quantification (LOQ mg L-1) are as follows: for HNS, epsilon = 2.75 x 10(4) and LOQ = 0.48 (in admixture with TNT); for NTO, epsilon = 6.83 x 10(3) and LOQ = 0.73. These methods were not affected from nitramines and nitrate esters in synthetic mixtures or composite explosives. The developed methods were statistically validated against HPLC, and the existing chromatographic method was modified so as to enable NTO determination in the presence of TNT. These simple, low-cost, and versatile methods can be used in criminology, remediation/monitoring of contaminated sites, and kinetic stability modeling of munitions containing desensitized energetic materials.

A high precision instantaneous detonation model (,"The utilization of underwater explosion prediction programs incorporating explosives is not widespread in engineering at present, primarily due to the complexity associated with the detonation reaction process. The instantaneous detonation model (IDM) serves as a valuable tool for simulating underwater explosions due to its efficiency in engineering applications, disregarding the detonation reaction process. However, existing analytical solutions for the distribution of detonation gaseous products, based on the assumption of 1D isentropic flow, have limitations in accuracy. Moreover, alternative IDM approaches have not gained widespread recognition. In this study, we present a novel IDM, termed hp-IDM, which predicts fluid structure in the detonation zone using high-order solutions derived from the Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) model. The spatial aspect of the DSD model is discretized using fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstruction in characteristic space and Lax-Friedrich's splitting, while temporal terms are discretized via a third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta scheme. Interface motion is captured using the level-set method combined with the modified ghost fluid method model, and a programmed burn model describes the generation and propagation of the detonation wave. We validate the self-similarity of detonation wave propagation using the DSD model and derive quantitative calculation formulas for the IDM by averaging or curve fitting dimensionless results. Subsequently, the hp-IDM model is established through high-order polynomial approximation of the Taylor rarefaction zone and the constant static zone for 1D planar, cylindrical, and spherical TNT charges. The application of the hp-IDM model involves direct mapping from the radial direction to spatial structured grids for 1D planar, 2D cylindrical, and 3D spherical shaped charges. Numerical results demonstrate that the hp-IDM model proposed in this paper achieves both high accuracy and computational efficiency.",2024
A novel modification method for the dynamic mechanical test using thermomechanical analyzer for composite multi-layered energetic materials,"Herein, we present a thermo-mechanical analyzer (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) of composite multi-layered gun propellant, focusing on thermal expansion coefficients and dynamic thermomechanical properties. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of the prepared energetic ma-terial is determined as approx. 0.1800 x 10-4 -0.2081 x 10-4 K-1. According to DMA test and dynamic thermomechanical properties, the glass transition temperature is also obtained. The tested value is within the range of 223.01-223.50 K, which indicates the lower limit of the energetic material. However, DMA tests reveal temperature changes, which occur due to thermal expansion. Moreover, the geomet-rical factor decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore, thermal expansion significantly affects the storage modulus and loss modulus. Additionally, the thermal expansion coefficient can be used to modify the storage and loss modulus. The results show that the proposed method provides effective and reliable modified results.(c) 2021 China Ordnance Society. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co.

"A strategy for stabilizing of N8 type energetic materials by introducing 4-Nitro-1,2,3-Triazole scaffolds","A series of multi-functionalized 4-nitro-1,2,3-triazole based C-N linked biheterocyclic energetic compounds were synthesized using CDI (1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole) induced dehydrative cyclization.

Probing impact of molecular structure on bulk modulus and impact sensitivity of energetic materials by machine learning methods,"Machine learning (ML) can map the complex relationship between structures and properties, thus exhibiting great promise in various fields. The bulk modulus (mechanical property) and the impact sensitivity are crucial for energetic compounds. However, relationships have not been elucidated between the molecular structure and the bulk modulus and between the two important properties. Thus, artificial neural network (ANN) and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) methods coupled with selected molecular descriptors were introduced to explore their relationship models for 240 nitroaromatic compounds. In total, six ML models are constructed. The coefficient of determination, root mean squared error and the t-test from 10-fold cross-validation indicate that ANN significantly outperforms SISSO for the bulk modulus and the impact sensitivity models. However, SISSO exhibits comparable prediction accuracy with ANN for the relationship model between the impact sensitivity and the bulk modulus. Besides, the feature evaluation reveals that the average molecular weight, the number of unsaturated and oxygen-containing groups, hydrophilicity and three-dimensional structure play major roles in influencing the bulk modulus while main contributions to the impact sensitivity come from the structure features involving oxygen-containing group, distribution of atomic properties and hydrophilicity. Furthermore, the SISSO model explicitly gives an inverse-like function relationship for the two important properties. It indicates that the impact sensitivity sharply decreases with increasing bulk modulus when the bulk modulus is small, while an opposite trend occurs in the case of relatively large bulk modulus. These findings could provide useful structural information for improving comprehensive properties of energetic materials.",2021
Electrochemical reduction of nitrotriazoles in aqueous media as an approach to the synthesis of new green energetic materials,"The synthesis of new azo and azoxy compounds via electrochemical reduction of nitrotriazoles has been investigated in aqueous media, using nitrotriazolone (NTO) and nitrotriazole (NTr) as representative substrates. Reduction of NTO produces mainly solid azoxytriazolone (AZTO), with azotriazolone (azoTO) and aminotriazolone (ATO) as minor products, while 3-hydroxylaminotriazole is the major product formed from NTr. AZTO and azoTO are of interest as new green high-nitrogen compounds for use as insensitive high explosives (IHE). The effect of varying reaction conditions such as pH and substrate concentration has been evaluated, and a mechanism is proposed accounting for the experimental observations. In particular, the ratio of azoxy to azo in the solid product is influenced by pH and temperature, and the minor product ATO is formed not via direct reduction of NTO but via a novel thermal disproportionation reaction of the hydrazotriazolone intermediate. Conditions of high substrate concentration and low cell temperature maximise the azoxy yield and minimise the formation of minor products. Results indicate that this green electrosynthetic approach may be generally useful for the synthesis of new azoxy and azo triazoles from suitable substrates.",2011
Energetic Tagged Zirconium-Based Metal-Organic Framework: A Novel Catalyst and High Energy Dense Material for Solid Propellants,"Catalyst for ammonium percholorate (AP) decomposition was limited to inert particles, with subsequent decrease in main decomposition temperature.

In this work, two-dimensional simulations are conducted for heterogeneous LX-17 energetic material containing array-distributed cavities to investigate the detonation initiation process induced by the impaction of the incident shock wave (ISW), and the impacts of cavity size and volume fraction on the shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) are also evaluated. First, we fix the cavity radius to be 40 mu m and the cavity volume fraction to be 12.57%, and compare the detonation initiation processes for neat and heterogeneous LX-17 energetic materials. The results indicate that cavities within LX-17 can accelerate the detonation initiation, i.e., shortening the initiation distance and time. Then, the flow characteristics and incident shock wave evolutions during the cavity collapse process are analyzed. The results show that the interaction between the cavity and the incident shock wave results in the local hot spots and causes LX-17 reactant to auto-ignite, so as to accelerate the shock-to-detonation transition. Finally, the influence of the cavity size and volume fraction on the detonation initiation process is assessed. It is found that as the cavity volume fraction increases, the detonation initiation distance and time increase and even become larger than the results predicted of the neat case, i.e., the acceleration effect of cavities on the detonation initiation weakens and the cavities even inhibits the shock-to-detonation transition. When the cavity volume fraction is fixed, it is found cases of small-size cavity predict longer initiation distance and time than cases of large-size cavity. The analysis indicates that increasing cavity volume fraction corresponds to smaller density of LX-17 reactant, and the hot spot duration time is shorter for cases of small-size cavity than cases of large-size cavity. Therefore, the detonation initiation distance and time increase as the cavity volume fraction increases and the cavity size decreases.",2023
Evolution of Oxidizing Inorganic Metal Salts: Ultrafast Laser Initiation Materials Based on Energetic Cationic Coordination Polymers,"An effective and novel design strategy for ultrafast laser-initiating materials has been established on the basis of coordination chemistry for the first time in the present work. In view of the positive effect of Ag ion and perchlorate on laser sensitivity, silver perchlorate as a representative of oxidizing inorganic metal salts was used to construct energetic cationic coordination polymers (ECCPs), which solved the inconvenient situation caused by the difficulty in applying these salts directly in energetic materials because of the unavoidable hygroscopicity and the inhomogeneity of physical mixtures of oxidants and reductants. With the nonenergetic nitrogen-rich ligand 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole-5-carbohydrazide (ATCA), one new laser-sensitive Ag(I)-based ECCP [Ag(ATCA)ClO4](n) (1) was successfully synthesized with a compact helical structure proved by X-ray single-diffraction crystal data. The physicochemical property evaluation revealed that this Ag-ECCP was not only completely devoid of the undesirable properties of the silver perchlorate and displayed excellent tolerance to moisture and noncorrosive properties to metal shells, but was also endowed with good thermal stability and excellent safety for mechanical stimulation. Moreover, theoretical calculations based on the standard molar enthalpy of formation and the lead plate explosive test as the actual damage experiment have proved that the compound has a superior detonation performance (up to 6800 m s(-1) and 0.511 kcal g(-1)) compared to the traditional primary explosives. More importantly, the laser-initiation-experiment-based femtosecond laser-testing system and high-speed photography demonstrated that this ECCP was an energetic material with great potential for application in the safety detonator as an ultrafast photosensitive initiating material for laser direct initiation, whose initiation delay time is as low as 73 ms using only 200 mJ initiation energy.",2019
Investigation of the Effect of Various Substituents on the Density of Tetrazolium Nitrate Salts as Green Energetic Materials,"The substitution effect of various functional groups such as -NO2, -CN, -N-3, -NF2, and -NH2 on the density of tetrazolium nitrate salts is investigated through multiple linear regression method. The methodology of this work introduces a new model, which related density of tetrazolium nitrate salts to the number of fluorine and nitrogen atoms, the presence of NF2 groups, NO2 groups, as well as CH3 groups in the structural formula. The new reliable correlation shows that the NF2 and NO2 group can cause increasing the density of tetrazolium nitrate salts, especially NO2, whereas the CH3 group can decrease their density. The new proposed relationship has good reliability and predictability, so it can be used to design new rich nitrogen compounds based on tetrazolium nitrate salts as green energetic materials. These results are also tested for N,N-azo-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate salts, which is caused to derive another correlation. This correlation shows that the presence of NF2 functional groups increases the density of N,N-azo-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate salts as well as the value of n(O)/n(C).",2016

Dimerization of merocyanine dyes.: Structural and energetic characterization of dipolar dye aggregates and implications for nonlinear optical materials,"Aggregation of polar merocyanine dyes has been identified as an important problem in the. fabrication of organic materials for photonic applications. In this work, a series of merocyanine dyes is synthesized, and their aggregation is investigated by a combination of several experimental techniques to reveal structure-property relationships. These studies provide clear evidence for the formation of centrosymmetric dimers for all investigated merocyanines in concentrated solution and in the solid state. The thermodynamics of dimerization in liquid solution is studied by concentration-dependent permittivity measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, and electrooptical absorption experiments. A centrosymmetric dimer structure with antiparallel ordering of the dipole moments is observed in solution by 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as in the solid state by X-ray crystallography and interpreted in terms of dipolar and pi-pi interactions. The optical properties of the dimer aggregates are satisfactorily explained by an excitonic coupling model. The effect of an external electric field on the dimerization equilibrium is considered and quantitatively determined by electrooptical absorption measurements. Implications of the observed findings on the design of nonlinear optical and photorefractive materials are discussed.",2002
Design of advanced and highly effective partially bio-energetic polybenzoxazines as the next generation of reactive structure materials,"In this study, a new class of energetic green benzoxazine polymers is introduced based on vanillin, as a renewable reactant. The newly developed monomers were afforded by the reaction of vanillin with exploshores groups bearing compounds, namely the 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine and the para-nitroaniline, respectively, following the typical Mannich reaction. The chemical structure and the formation of the oxazine ring of both monomers were confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR, FTIR, and elemental analysis. The ring opening polymerization mechanism was investigated by FTIR and DSC-TGA analyses. The energetic performances, as well as the physicochemical properties, were studied by a bomb calorimeter, deflagration tester, and electronic densimeter. Overall, both polymers showed promising energetic performances with deflagration temperatures of about 275 and 261 & DEG;C for the 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine and para-nitroaniline-based polybenzoxazines, respectively. The thermal analysis results highlighted that these polymers can be effectively used as reactive structure materials (RSMs) owing to their combination of high thermal stability above operational temperatures and remarkable energetic performances.",
Spectroscopic measurements of the combustion of aluminum and aluminum-based energetic material particles using a heterogeneous shock tube,"Aluminum is a desirable component of propellants, explosives, and energetic materials due to the high energy release associated with its oxidation. Considerable research has been done on aluminum combustion, but questions remain about the behavior of aluminum particles, particularly at small particle sizes where the traditional optical imaging techniques can no longer be employed. This study looks at the behavior of small (10 μm and smaller) aluminum and aluminum-based particles, including aluminum hydride and aluminum/metal oxide nanocomposites, using a heterogeneous shock tube. A dispersed cloud of individually burning particles is examined by analyzing the spectral emission and absorption of the burning cloud, through techniques including pyrometry, photometry, and emission and absorption spectroscopy. These measurements have led to the determination that aluminum particles below 10 μm do not burn with the gas-phase diffusion flame observed in larger (>20 μm) sizes, but rather with reactions occurring very close to the particle surface. These particles thus have lower combustion temperatures and longer burn times than would be expected under correlations developed based on large particle combustion. This size regime of particles is currently used in rocket propellants, and as compared to larger sizes, these particles burn with significantly different properties, such as a significant pressure dependence on burn rate and lower combustion temperatures. As size is decreased further to the nano-particle regime (∼10-500 nm), the particles were observed to burn with lower combustion temperatures, smaller diameter dependence, and Arrhenius-style burn rates. This behavior is consistent with a shrinking-core flame structure, where the oxide coating remains around the particle while condensed phase diffusion controls the oxidation process. The same diagnostic tools have also been applied to aluminum hydride to determine its combustion characteristics, as well as aluminum/metal oxide nanocomposites to measure the ignition characteristics and the degree of participation of the ambient environment in its combustion process. These measurements have significant implications for the use of aluminum-based particles in practical energetic material applications, and these implications will also be discussed.",2006
Proximal Detection of Traces of Energetic Materials with an Eye-Safe UV Raman Prototype Developed for Civil Applications,"A new Raman-based apparatus for proximal detection of energetic materials on people, was developed and tested for the first time. All the optical and optoelectronics components of the apparatus, as well as their optical matching, were carefully chosen and designed to respect international eye-safety regulations. In this way, the apparatus is suitable for civil applications on people in public areas such as airports and metro or railway stations. The acquisition software performs the data analysis in real-time to provide a fast response to the operator. Moreover, it allows for deployment of the apparatus either as a stand alone device or as part of a more sophisticated warning system architecture made up of several sensors. Using polyamide as substrate, the apparatus was able to detect surface densities of ammonium nitrate (AN), 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT), 3-nitrooxy-2,2-bis(nitrooxymethyl)propyl] nitrate (PETN) and urea nitrate (UN) in the range of 100-1000 g/cm(2) at a distance of 6.4 m using each time a single laser pulse of 3 mJ/cm(2). The limit of detection calculated for AN is 289 g/cm(2). AN and UN provided the highest percentages of true positives (>82% for surface densities of 100-400 g/cm(2) and fingerprints) followed by TNT and PETN (17%-70% for surface densities of 400-1000 g/cm(2) and fingerprints).",2016

Iron and Copper Doped Zinc Oxide Nanopowders as a Sensitizer of Industrial Energetic Materials to Visible Laser Radiation,"The development of methods ensuring reliable control over explosive chemical reactions is a critical task for the safe and efficient application of energetic materials. Triggering the explosion by laser radiation is one of the promising methods. In this work, we demonstrate a technique of applying the common industrial high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) as a photosensitive energetic material by adding zinc oxide nanopowders doped with copper and iron. Nanopowders of ZnO:Fe and ZnO:Cu able to absorb visible light were synthesized. The addition of one mass percent nanopowders in PETN decreased the threshold energy density of its initiation through Nd:YAG laser second harmonic (2.33 eV) by more than five times. The obtained energetic composites can be reliably initiated by a CW blue laser diode with a wavelength of 450 nm and power of 21 W. The low threshold initiation energy and short irradiation exposure of the PETN-ZnO:Cu composite makes it applicable in laser initiation devices. PETN-ZnO:Cu also can be initiated by an infrared laser diode with a wavelength of 808 nm. The proposed photochemical mechanism of the laser-induced triggering of the explosion reaction in the studied energetic composites was formulated. The results demonstrate the high promise of using nanomaterials based on zinc oxide as a sensitizer of industrial energetic materials to visible laser radiation.",2022
"Green Electrosynthesis of 5,5′-Azotetrazolate Energetic Materials Plus Energy-Efficient Hydrogen Production Using Ruthenium Single-Atom Catalysts","Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, that is, oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish OER is a significant limiting step that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermo-dynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value-added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost-effective production of value-added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single-atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35 V at a current of 10 mA cm(-2) by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole to synthesize 5,5'-azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high-temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by-products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.",2022
Exploring the highly dense energetic materials via regiochemical modulation: A comparative study of two fluorodinitromethyl-functionalized herringbone trifuroxans,"Maximization of the energy capability of energetic materials by organizing energetic moieties into dense arrangements is of great significance. In this study, two novel high-energy regioisomers, 3,4-bis(3-fluorodinitromethylfuroxan-4-yl) furoxan (BFTF-1) and 3,4-bis(4-fluorodinitromethylfuroxan-3-yl) furoxan (BFTF-2), were synthesized by employing controllable synthetic strategy. The constitutional isomers were thoroughly characterized using multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, BFTF-1 shows the highest crystal density (rho: 2.00 g cm(-3), 296 K) among fluorodinitromethyl-functionalized CHNOF compounds reported thus far and outstanding detonation performances (D: 9509 m s(-1), P: 42.6 GPa), which are significantly higher than that of BFTF-2 (rho: 1.91 g cm(-3), D: 9196 m s(-1)). The remarkable differences in inter- and intra-molecular interactions of BFTF-1 and BFTF-2 provide unequivocal evidence that the synergistic actions between fluorodinitromethyl and furoxan play a key role in crystal stacking, eventually causing a significant difference in density. This research demonstrates that regiochemical modulation via reasonable design could be a powerful tool to enhance the density and detonation property in the development of new energetic materials.",2020
Data-Driven Integrated Decision Model for Analysing Energetic Behaviour of Innovative Construction Materials Capable of Hybrid Energy Storage,"Aligning the European Union goals for climate neutrality by 2050 and the ambition for carbon equivalent emissions reduction to almost half by 2030 demands the exploration of alternative decarbonisation pathways. Energy consumption across all sectors is identified as a crucial contributor to this challenge, with a number of legislative and regulatory frameworks and commitments to be introduced every year. In response to these trends, the concept of exploiting a building's thermal mass through the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enhances the ability of building elements to reserve and deliver large amounts of energy during phase transitions. However, the incorporation of PCMs into building elements requires the thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour. This study evaluates and predicts the thermophysical properties of mineral particles carrying PCMs and coated with a cementitious layer able to be utilised as fillers in construction applications. By employing deep learning and predictive modelling techniques, the numerical data-driven model developed in this paper enhances accuracy and efficiency in property estimation and prediction, facilitating material selection, system design, and optimisation. A model in a MATLAB simulation environment is presented, evaluating and predicting the thermophysical properties of semi-organic particles able to enhance building envelope thermal mass as a hybrid energy storage solution. These findings show the time needed for a building block to undergo cooling, demonstrating a clear upgrade in the thermal discharge of the walls. Substituting traditional EP with PCM-enhanced EP leads to a minimum reduction of 1 & DEG;C per hour in the discharge rate, thereby extending the comfort duration of indoor spaces without necessitating additional space heating. These models offer the potential for assessing diverse material compositions and usage scenarios, offering valuable insights to aid decisions in optimizing building energy efficiency.",2023
Coupling characteristics of combustion-gas flows generated by two energetic materials in base bleed unit under rapid depressurization,"The present study is devoted to investigate the physical characteristics of the coupling combusting-gas flows generated by gun propellant and pyrotechnics along with the effect of initial pressure on the extension behavior of the igniter combustion jet under the rapid depressurization process that the BBU (base bleed unit) undergoes when a BBP (base bleed projectile) is flying out of the muzzle. A semi-closed bomb is designed to reproduce the depressurization process. The near-nozzle pattern evolution of the exhaust plume is observed by using an HSC (high-speed camera). Based on the experiment, a two-dimensional axisymmetric model is established including the high-resolution upwind scheme AUSM(+) and the finite-rate chemistry model (no turbulence-chemistry interaction). The cell-centered FVM (finite volume method) is employed to simulate the coupling characteristics of the two high-temperature combustion gases under sharp depressurization. The results show that as the pressure drops rapidly, the exhaust plume gradually transforms from highly underexpanded supersonic flow into a subsonic flow, in where the wave structure converts from Mach reflection to regular reflection. The periodic shock diamond and rhombic flame string are formed, and finally the flame becomes continuous. In the subsonic flow, the radial heat convection and diffusion downstream of the flame in BBU are stronger than upstream. During the depressurization process, the influence of initial NPR (nozzle pressure ratio) becomes more significant. As the initial NPR increases, the igniter flame squashes downstream more slowly, and the heat loss of the gas expansion accelerates, thus the radial heat convection and diffusion in BBU decrease.",2019
"Comparisons of Monte Carlo calculations with absorbed dose determinations in flat materials using high-current, energetic electron beams","International standards and guidelines for calibrating high-dose dosimetry systems to be used in industrial radiation processing recommend that dose-rate effects on dosimeters be evaluated under conditions of use. This is important when the irradiation relies on high-current electron accelerators, which usually provide very high dose-rates. However, most dosimeter calibration facilities use low-intensity gamma radiation or low-current electron accelerators, which deliver comparatively low dose-rates. Because of issues of thermal conductivity and response, portable calorimeters cannot be practically used with high-current accelerators, where product conveyor speeds under an electron beam can exceed several meters per second and the calorimeter is not suitable for use with product handling systems. As an alternative, Monte Carlo calculations can give theoretical estimates of the absorbed dose in materials with flat or complex configurations such that the results are independent of dose-rate. Monte Carlo results can then be compared to experimental dose determinations to see whether dose-rate effects in the dosimeters are significant. A Monte Carlo code has been used in this study to calculate the absorbed doses in alanine film dosimeters supported by flat sheets of plywood irradiated with electrons using incident energies extending from 1.0 MeV to 10 MeV with beam currents up to 30 mA. The same process conditions have been used for dose determinations with high-current electron beams using low dose-rate gamma calibrated alanine film dosimeters. The close agreement between these calculations and the dosimeter determinations indicates that the response of this type of dosimeter system is independent of the dose-rate, and provides assurance that Monte Carlo calculations can yield results with sufficient accuracy for many industrial applications. @ 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Onset of catalytic activity of graphene nanosheets in reaction with energetic materials evaluated by ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation,"A computational strategy based on ReaxFF reactive force field unravels details of the combustion of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine/graphene (RDX/GR). This method allows us to resolve the evolution of species and structures, as well as the catalytic mechanism of GR. A comparative analysis of decay rate in RDX (pure RDX, RDX/GR, and RDX/porous GR) demonstrates that the catalytic activity of GR is dependent on the density and temperature. The wrinkled graphene formed by thermal fluctuation and extrusion in the initial stage has more significant catalytic activity. O, OH, and NO2 tend to bond to the dangling sp2 C atoms in the wrinkled graphene. In combustion catalysis, GR accelerates the interatomic exchanges between active groups on GR and RDX. However, the atomic exchange hardly damages the integrity of the carbon nanosheets. The density functional theory method further verified that the active groups are adsorbed on graphene. The sorption energy of NO2 attached to the convex of wrinkled GR is 2.79 kcal/mol higher than that on the flat GR. Our findings shed light on the complicated interplay between combustion catalysts and energetic materials.",2022
Energetic and exergetic analysis of a new double pass solar air collector with fins and phase change material,"Advanced solar air collectors are widely implemented in research for drying purposes. This research study presents a new steady state energy balance and exergy equations for a novel double pass solar air collector with fins and phase change material (PCM) according to first and second law of thermodynamics. The mathematical equations of energy balance were solved using the matrix inversion method. The predictions were observed at mass flow rates ranging from 0.01 kg/sec to 0.15 kg/sec, and solar radiation ranging between 425 W/m(2) and 1000 W/m(2). The impacts of solar radiation levels and mass air rates on energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and the improvement potential have been estimated and evaluated. The optimum energy efficiency of proposed collector is 73% at mass air rate of 0.15 kg/sec. The exergy efficiency is nearly 2.5-4.2% at maximum solar radiation level of 1000 W/m(2) as well as the lowest and highest improvement potential are 980-2287 W for a solar radiation of 425-1000 W/m(2.)",2021
Dancing with Energetic Nitrogen Atoms: Versatile N-Functionalization Strategies for ,"Nitrogen-rich heterocycles represent a unique class of energetic frameworks featuring high heats of formation and high nitrogen content, which have generated considerable research interest in the field of high energy density materials (HEDMs). Although traditional C-functionalization methodology of aromatic hydrocarbons has been fully established, studies on N-functionalization strategies of nitrogen-containing heterocycles still have great potential to be exploited by virtue of forming diverse N-X bonds (X = C, N, O, B, halogen, etc.), which are capable of regulating energy performance and the stability of the resulting energetic compounds. In this sense, versatile N-functionalization of N-heterocyclic frameworks offers a flexible strategy to meet the requirements of developing new-generation HEDMs. In this Account, the role of strategic N-functionalization in designing new energetic frameworks, including the formation of N-C, N-N, N-O, N-B and N-halogen bonds, is emphasized. In the family of N-functionalized HEDMs, energetic derivatives, by virtue of forming N-C bonds, are the most widely used type due to the good nucleophilic capacity of most heterocyclic backbones. Although introduction of carbon tends to decrease energetic performance, significant improvement in material sensitivity makes this strategy attractive for safety concerns. More importantly, most explosophores can be readily introduced into the N-C linkage, thus providing a promising route to various HEDMs. Formation of additional N-N bonds typically gives rise to higher heats of formation, implying the potential enhancement in detonation performance. In many cases, the increased hydrogen bonding interactions within N-N functionalized heterocycles also improve thermal stability accordingly. Introduction of a single N,N '-azo bridge into several azole moieties leads to an extended nitrogen chain, demonstrating a new strategy for designing high-nitrogen compounds. The strategy of N-O functionalization has become an increasingly efficient tool for exploring new HEDMs with both high energy and low sensitivity. As a highly dense building block, introduction of oxygen not only improves density significantly but also gives rise to a better oxygen balance. Furthermore, the N-O functionalized strategy is highly suitable for a broad variety of N-heterocycles including five-membered azoles and six-membered azines. Newly explored N-halogen and N-B functionalization strategies have endowed the resulting HEDMs with some new energetic characteristics. Typical examples include the N-halogenated fused triazole and FOX-7 as potential hypergolic oxidizers with very short ignition delay times. In addition, some exploratory studies of N-B functionalized heterocycles have expanded energetic applications as hypergolic ionic liquids, green pyrotechnic colorants, and high-oxygen carriers. Overall, flexible N-functionalization methodologies involving different N-X bond formation have not only provided an efficient approach to diverse energetic ingredients but also expanded the application scope of energetic materials. Discussion and perspectives of N-functionalized protocols are given to summarize possible structure-property correlations, thus providing efficient guidelines for future design of new HEDMs.",2016
Generation of Electrohydraulic Shock Waves by Plasma-Ignited Energetic Materials: II. Influence of Wire Configuration and Stored Energy,"Electrohydraulic shock waves (SWs) have been used for shale gas exploitation in recent years. The traditional method to generate SWs is underwater pulsed discharge with a water gap load or an electrical wire (EW) load, but the SW energy is limited heavily by the stored energy. To obtain stronger SW, the EW explosion ignited energetic material (EM) load is proposed here. To obtain a good ignition performance, the influence of capacitor charging voltage, stored energy, wire diameter, and wire material (Cu and Mo) were studied. The results show that the higher the charging voltage is, the more effective the ignition is; liquidation and vaporization will affect the discharge but will not ignite the EM explosion effectively; the EMs given in this paper are more sensitive to the arc plasma. Besides, the nonrefractory copper is more suitable for the EM ignition than the refractory molybdenum.",2015
"Quantum-chemical design of tetrazolo[1,5-","The molecular structures of azole substituted tetrazolo[1,5-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazine (AsTT) derivatives were designed and fully optimized at the B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Isodesmic reaction was constructed to predict gas phase heat of formation (HOF) and heat of sublimation derived from Politzer approach was used to calculate HOF at condensed phase. The presence of nitrogen-rich AsTF backbone is found promising in increasing the HOF values. Politzer approach also extended to predict the densities of these derivatives from the calculated surface electrostatic properties. Kamlet-Jacobs equations were used to calculate detonation performances based on predicted solid phase heats of formation, densities and gaseous detonation products. The charge distribution on molecular surface and free space per molecule in the unit cell were used to analyze the sensitivity. The explosive power and power index were calculated to assess the potential of designed compounds. According to our calculations, the designed AsTT derivatives possess interesting explosive properties and could be the potential addition in high energy materials (HEMs). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Improved Detection of Highly Energetic Materials Traces on Surfaces by Standoff Laser Induced Thermal Emission Incorporating Neural Networks,"Terrorists conceal highly energetic materials (HEM) as Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in various types of materials such as PVC, wood, Teflon, aluminum, acrylic, carton and rubber to disguise them from detection equipment used by military and security agency personnel. Infrared emissions (IREs) of substrates, with and without HEM, were measured to generate models for detection and discrimination. Multivariable analysis techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM) and neural networks (NN) were employed to generate models, in which the emission of IR light from heated samples was stimulated using a CO2 laser giving rise to laser induced thermal emission (LITE) of HEMs. Traces of a specific target threat chemical explosive: PETN in surface concentrations of 10 to 300 ug/cm(2) were studied on the surfaces mentioned. Custom built experimental setup used a CO2 laser as a heating source positioned with a telescope, where a minimal loss in reflective optics was reported, for the Mid-IR at a distance of 4 m and 32 scans at 10 s. SVM-DA resulted in the best statistical technique for a discrimination performance of 97%. PLS-DA accurately predicted over 94% and NN 88%.",2013
Achieving ultra-high heat resistance of novel energetic materials through a hydrogen bonding and extended π-conjugation strategy,"With the increasing demand for deep oil well resources and rapid development of aerospace exploration, the search for advanced heat-resistant energetic compounds has attracted the attention of researchers in the field of energetic materials. In this study, two heat-resistant energetic materials, viz. 3,6-bis(3,5-diamino-4-nitropyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-triazine (NPX-01) and 2,4,6-tri(3,5-diamino-4-nitropyrazol-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (NPX-02) were designed and synthesized through a synergistic strategy of designing strong hydrogen bonding and extended pi-conjugation. The thermal decomposition temperatures of NPX-01 and NPX-02 reached 370.4 degrees C and 387.7 degrees C, respectively, which are even higher than those of commonly used heat-resistant energetic materials such as TATB (T-d = 360.0 degrees C) and PYX (T-d = 360.0 degrees C). Moreover, NPX-01 and NPX-02 also exhibited good detonation velocity (D = 8769 m s(-1) and D = 8310 m s(-1), respectively) and low mechanical sensitivities (IS >= 40 J, FS > 360 N), demonstrating their great potential as novel heat-resistant energetic materials.",2024
Comparison of 1-Propyl-5,"Laser ignitable explosives are potential candidates in future applications for replacing toxic and very sensitive primary explosives, which are used in current devices. In this study, the literature unknown ligand 1-azidopropyl-SH-tetrazole (APT, 1) was synthesized for the first time and applied in energetic coordination compounds (ECC). The complexes are based on different 3d transition metals (Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as well as various oxidizing anions (NO3-, ClO4-, and ClO3-) and were tested toward their capability as laser ignitable explosives. Furthermore, analogous complexes based on the literature known ligand 1-propyl-SH-tetrazole (PT, 2) were investigated for comparing the influence of the additional azide group toward the performance of the ECC. Toxicity measurements using Vibrio fischeri and the decreased sensitivities prove their usability as safer laser ignitable explosive with lower toxicities compared to currently used explosives.",2020
THE ENERGETIC AND EXPERIMENTAL BASED APPROACH TO DESCRIPTION OF BASIC MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SELECTED POLYMERS,"The paper presents a proposal of using an experimental phenomenological approach and energy based method to the modelling of mechanical properties of nonlinear elastic materials using examples of two selected polymers.

The volumetric part of energy has been used in the description of the material damage process interpreted as the appearance of the first plastic deformations, which is the original part of the work and continuous investigations carried out by Wegner and Kurpisz. All theoretical investigations have been illustrated using examples of PVC and PA-6.",2020
"1,2,4-Triazolium and Tetrazolium Picrate Salts: ""On the Way"" from Nitroaromatic to Azole-Based Energetic Materials","A family of energetic salts based on the picrate anion and several azolium cations were synthesized either by new methods or by known literature procedures. The cations of choice were the following: 5-amino-1H-tetrazolium (1), 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-tetrazolium (2), 5-amino-2-methyl-1H-tetrazolium (3), 5-amino-1,4-dimethyl-1H-tetrazolium (4), 5-amino-1,3-dimethyl-1H-tetrazolium (5), 1,5-diamino-1H-tetrazolium (6), 1,5-diamino-4-methyl-1H-tetrazolium (7), 3,4,5-triamino-1,2,4-triazolium or guanazinium (8) and 3,4,5-triamino-1-methyl-1,2,4-triazolium or methylguanazinium (9). A summary of the N-15 NMR shifts for all Compounds is given, and the proton-/methyl-induced shifts (PISs/MISs) are discussed with relation to the crystal structures. Because hydrogen bonding plays an important role in determining the density and thus the performance of energetic materials, the crystal structures are discussed in detail. In addition, tests to assess the impact (i) and friction (f) sensitivities of the compounds and thermal stability measurements (DSC) were also carried out, revealing insensitive compounds (i > 40 J, f > 360 N) with high thermal stabilities (T-d >175 degrees C). The constant volume energies of combustion were determined experimentally by oxygen bomb calorimetry and their validity was checked by quantum chemical calculation (MP2) of electronic energies. The detonation pressures and velocities of 1 (7795 ms(-1), 25.6 GPa), 2 (7343 ms(-1), 21.2 GPa), 3 (7213 ms(-1), 20.4 GPa), 4 (6876 ms(-1), 17.8 GPa), 5 (6846 ms(-1), 17.6 GPa), 6 (7864 ms(-1), 25.4 GPa), 7 (7492 ms(-1), 22.1 GPa), 8 (7495 ms(-1), 22.5 GPa) and 9 (7162 ms(-1), 19.8 GPa) were predicted by use of the EXPLO5 code. Lastly, the ICT code was used to predict the decomposition gases of all salts. ((C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2008)",2008
A comprehensive review on flow field properties in polymer mixing processes: a focus on applications in energetic materials,"The mixing process is a critical step in the production of energetic materials and has a profound impact on product performance. As modern formulations for energetic materials continue to advance, the needs placed on the mixing process have become increasingly complex. Understanding and mastering the properties of the mixing flow field are essential for achieving optimal mixing function, ensuring process safety, and optimizing the parameters of both the mixing process and equipment specifically for energetic materials. In this comprehensive review, we analyze the influence of flow field properties on the mixing process of energetic materials by examining the mixing mechanism of two types of flow within the flow field. Additionally, we provide evidence to support the advantages of elongational flow in achieving effective mixing. We also discuss the application of mixing flow field properties in the processing of energetic materials, including advancements in mixing equipment and methods designed to optimize flow fields. Finally, we address the current shortcomings in energetic material mixing and offer an outlook for future developments in this field.",2024
Core-shell type multi-arm azide polymers based on hyperbranched copolyether as potential energetic materials in solid propellants,"A series of novel multi-arm azide copolymers (POGs) with the same hyperbranched poly[3-ethyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)oxetane] core (PEHO-c) and different content of linear glycidyl azide polymer shell (GAP-s) have been synthesized by sequential cationic ring-opening polymerization and azidation. Detailed structural information of these copolyethers was deduced from Fourier transform infrared, H-1 NMR and inverse gated decoupled C-13 NMR spectroscopies, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis. The molecular weight of POG having GAP-s and PEHO-c with a molar ratio 14.95:1 (R-s/c) was around 31 000g mol(-1), far above that of linear GAP (around 4000g mol(-1)). The apparent viscosity and glass transition temperature (-51 to -23 degrees C) decreased first and then slightly increased with increasing molecular weight. Thermal analysis revealed that all the obtained POGs exhibited excellent resistance to thermal decomposition up to 220 degrees C. Moreover, the energetic properties, investigated using oxygen bomb calorimetric measurements, indicated that the enthalpy of formation of the POGs was higher than that of general linear GAP, but similar to that of branched GAP under reasonable R-s/c. The compatibilities of the POGs with common materials used in solid propellants were studied using differential scanning calorimetry and the results indicated that the POGs had good compatibility with these materials.

Study of the laser-induced decomposition of energetic materials at static high-pressure by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy,"The reactivity of laser-initiated energetic materials has been studied at high-pressure using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The results obtained for nitromethane (NM) are presented in this paper. A change in reactivity is clearly seen around 25 GPa. Below this pressure, a one-step reaction is found to occur. The decomposition products formed behind the combustion front are essentially carbon residues as shown by Raman spectroscopy. At higher pressure, a two-step mechanism is observed. The first step, which is similar to the reaction observed below 25 GPa, leads to the formation of carbonaceous products. It is followed by a slower step which leads to the formation of a transparent amorphous product. This product remains stable in the DAC after reaction.",2014
Correlated RNN Framework to Quickly Generate Molecules with Desired Properties for Energetic Materials in the Low Data Regime,"Motivated by the challenging of deep learning on the low data regime and the urgent demand for intelligent design on highly energetic materials, we explore a correlated deep learning framework, which consists of three recurrent neural networks (RNNs) correlated by the transfer learning strategy, to efficiently generate new energetic molecules with a high detonation velocity in the case of very limited data available. To avoid the dependence on the external big data set, data augmentation by fragment shuffling of 303 energetic compounds is utilized to produce 500,000 molecules to pretrain RNN, through which the model can learn sufficient structure knowledge. Then the pretrained RNN is fine-tuned by focusing on the 303 energetic compounds to generate 7153 molecules similar to the energetic compounds. In order to more reliably screen the molecules with a high detonation velocity, the SMILE enumeration augmentation coupled with the pretrained knowledge is utilized to build an RNN-based prediction model, through which R-2 is boosted from 0.4446 to 0.9572. The comparable performance with the transfer learning strategy based on an existing big database (ChEMBL) to produce the energetic molecules and drug-like ones further supports the effectiveness and generality of our strategy in the low data regime. High-precision quantum mechanics calculations further confirm that 35 new molecules present a higher detonation velocity and lower synthetic accessibility than the classic explosive RDX, along with good thermal stability. In particular, three new molecules are comparable to caged CL-20 in the detonation velocity.

"Energetic material derivatives of insoluble 3,4,5-triamino-1-tetrazolyl-1,2,4-triazole (TATT)","The energetic derivatives of nitrogen-rich 3,4,5-triamino-1-tetrazolyl-1,2,4-triazolium (TATT) cation combined with nitrate (1), chloride (2) and perchlorate (3) anions were synthesized from the reaction of 3,4,5-triamino-1-tetrazolyl-1,2,4-triazole with various acids. All salts were characterized by IR, NMR and elemental analysis. Their structures were verified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Salt 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system P21/c. Salt 2 and 3 crystallize in the triclinic system P-1. Both theoretical and experimental methods demonstrate these compounds having positive heats of formation.

Design and Synthesis of Energetic Materials towards Versatile Applications by N-trinitromethyl and N-nitromethyl Functionalization of Nitroimidazoles,"Modifying the properties of energetic materials is important not only for gaining insight into the relationship between structures and properties but also for multiple applications. A new family of energetic compounds, polynitroimidazoles featuring trinitromethyl, nitromethyl and methyl acetate moieties at the nitrogen position of heterocyclic rings were synthesized. The high-energy oxidizers 2-nitro and 4-nitro-1-(trinitromethyl)-1H-imidazoles were obtained by nitration of 1-acetonylpolynitroimidazoles in fuming HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4. 4,5-Dinitro-1-(nitromethyl)-1H-imidazole and 4,5-dinitro-1-(acetate methyl)-1H-imidazole were afforded by using 68% HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4 through controllable synthesis. All the intermediates and the target compounds were confirmed by X-ray diffraction. It is noteworthy that one of the N-trinitromethyl nitroimidazole derivatives showed high density (: 1.88gcm(-3)), attractive positive oxygen balance (: +18.3%) and good detonation performance (D: 9003ms(-1)) exceeding those of ADN, while N-nitromethyl derivative behaved higher thermal stability and lower sensitivity in contrast to those of NG. N-acetate methyl derivative gave an interesting melt-castable property (T-m.p.: 86(o)C, T-d: 224(o)C), acceptable detonation performance as well as low sensitivity towards impact and friction (IS>40 J, FS>360 N), making it a competitive replacement for DNAN. These chemical and physical properties indicate that these novel materials show promising energetic performance towards future applications.",2018
Water decontamination via the removal of Pb (II) using a new generation of highly energetic surface nano-material: Co,"CoMo(CO32-) layered double hydroxide of a highly energetic surface, as a new LDH consisting of divalent and hexavalent cations (M+2/M+6-LDH), was prepared by a homogeneous co-precipitation method. The structure and morphology of the prepared material was confirmed by several analytical techniques namely; X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The highly energetic surface of the prepared LDH was demonstrated via the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface energy is due to the formation of +4 surface charges in the brucite layer between Co+2 and Mo+6. The prepared LDH was applied as a novel adsorbent for the removal of Pb (II) from its aqueous solution at different experimental conditions of time, temperature and initial Pb (II) concentrations. The change of the Pb (II) concentrations; due to adsorption, was monitored by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The maximum uptake of Pb (II) by the Co Mo LDH was (73.4 mg/g) at 298 K. The Pb (II) adsorption was found to follow Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order model. The adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. The interference of other cations on the removal of the Pb (II) was studied. Na+ and K+ were found to increase the adsorption capacity of the Co Mo LDH toward Pb (II) while it was slightly decreased by the presence of Mn+2 and Cu+2. The synthesized LDH showed a great degree of recoverability (7 times) while completely conserving its parental morphology and adsorption capacity. The mechanism of the lead ions removal had exhibited more reliability through a surface adsorption by the coordination between the Mo+6 of the brucite layers and the oxygen atoms of the nitrates counter ions.

Additionally, the heats of formation were calculated on the basis of the experimental constant-volume energies of combustion measured by using bomb calorimetry. Lastly, the sensitivities toward impact and friction were assessed according to Bundesamt fur Materialforschung (BAM) standard methods.",2015
On the stored and dissipated energies in heterogeneous rate-independent materials,The present paper is a part of a work that aims at building a dissipative model of microcrack friction in quasi-brittle energetic materials. The latter is viewed as an assembly of elementary cells containing the most salient features of the microstructure heterogeneity. It is intended here to build an analytical model describing the mechanical and energetic response of such an elementary cell under confined tension. This is achieved by applying a previously published theory that allows for the determination of the amount of dissipated and stored energies in heterogeneous dissipative structures containing microcracks and other dissipative components.,2011
"Electrochemically triggered degradation of energetic material FOX-7 (2,2-dinitroethene-1,1-diamine) - Structural, redox, and spectrometric characterization in solution","This work represents systemati11c electrochemical and spectrometric characterization of 2,2-dinitroethene-1,1-diamine, the energetic material (explosive) known as FOX-7, in aqueous as well as various organic solvents.

Energetic Materials - Nitrated Phenyl Peroxy Anhydrides as Peroxide Based Explosives with Relatively High Densities and Thermal Stabilities,"Nine different nitrated phenyl peroxy anhydrides were synthesized using two different strategies and crystal structures of two compounds were determined. Sensitivities of the compounds toward impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were measured and the thermal stability was determined.

Detonation parameters and performance data were calculated using the EXPLO5 program yielding performance values in the range of trinitrotoluene (TNT).",2016
Nitrogen-rich salts of 1-aminotetrazol-5-one: oxygen-containing insensitive energetic materials with high thermal stability,"1-Aminotetrazol-5-one (ATO) is a new insensitive nitrogen-rich energetic compound with quite attractive detonation properties (D = 8.88 km s(-1), P = 35.0 GPa), but its formation always requires harsh conditions to facilitate the process. In this contribution we presented an improved synthesis route of ATO in excellent yields and high purity. A large variety of nitrogen-rich salts of ATO were synthesized by means of Bronsted acid-base or metathesis reactions, and confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction for the first time. These compounds were fully characterized by FT-IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All the salts except 7a decompose at temperatures over 220 degrees C; in particular, the aminoguanidinium salt and 3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazolium salt are fairly stable with a decomposition temperature of 259 degrees C and 261.5 degrees C, respectively. Based on heats of formation calculated with Gaussian 09 and combined with experimentally determined densities, detonation properties of the energetic salts were obtained. They exhibit good thermal stability, excellent impact sensitivities (>40 J), reasonable detonation pressures (23.6-31.0 GPa) and velocities (7.53-8.72 km s(-1)) and might be potentially insensitive energetic materials.",2015
The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX): Tracing the Interaction Between the Heliosphere and Surrounding Interstellar Material with Energetic Neutral Atoms,"The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission is exploring the frontiers of the heliosphere where energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are formed from charge exchange between interstellar neutral hydrogen atoms and solar wind ions and pickup ions. The geography of this frontier is dominated by an unexpected nearly complete arc of ENA emission, now known as the IBEX 'Ribbon'. While there is no consensus agreement on the Ribbon formation mechanism, it seems certain this feature is seen for sightlines that are perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field as it drapes over the heliosphere. At the lowest energies, IBEX also measures the flow of interstellar H, He, and O atoms through the inner heliosphere. The asymmetric oxygen profile suggests that a secondary flow of oxygen is present, such as would be expected if some fraction of oxygen is lost through charge exchange in the heliosheath regions. The detailed spectra characterized by the ENAs provide time-tagged samples of the energy distributions of the underlying ion distributions, and provide a wealth of information about the outer heliosphere regions, and beyond.",2013
Obtaining superior high-density fused-ring energetic materials ,"Two carbonyl and o-NH2-NO2-containing energetic materials and their analogues were effectively designed, synthesized and fully characterized with multinuclear NMR, IR and elemental analyses. Their structures were also further confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Among them, compound 7 exhibits good potential for application as a secondary explosive with extremely high density (2.04 g cm(-3)), good sensitivity (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N), and excellent calculated detonation performance (D-v = 8943 m s(-1), P = 35.0 GPa). Furthermore, a detailed comparative study based on X-ray diffraction, Hirshfeld surfaces and 2D fingerprint plots among compounds 4, 7 and 9 has demonstrated that the density and detonation performance could be effectively improved via introducing a carbonyl group into fused-ring compounds. More importantly, the sensitivity of the resulting energetic materials did not deteriorate. Obviously, this strategy via introducing carbonyl, o-NH2-NO2 and nitroamino groups into fused-ring energetic compounds will help in the design of next-generation high-energy and insensitive fused-ring energetic materials.",2024
Development of an Energetic Material Information Self-Destruction Microsystem Based on Bistable Off-On Actuator Composed of Fusible Alloy,"The physical self-destruction of an information storage chip (ISC) driven by a detonation wave generated using energetic materials is an important method to ensure the security of key core information. To solve the related problems of high electrostatic sensitivity, poor overcurrent capability, and easy erroneous triggering, a bistable OFF-ON actuator (BO-OA)-based energetic material information self-destruction microsystem is proposed based on a fusible alloy. First, the BO-OA model based on the fusible alloy is constructed. By performing a finite element numerical analysis and experimenting, the response time of the Bi-Sn alloy with a continuous temperature rise from 22 degrees C to 138 degrees C is obtained. Second, a model of the energetic material dose and detonation wave transmission in an air domain is constructed. An analysis using LS-DYNA software indicates that copper azide can produce GPa-level stress waves in a millimeter-level air domain to realize ISC physical self-destruction. Finally, through bulk silicon processing and in situ reaction of the energetic materials, self-destruction module preparation and functional integration are realized. Experiments and simulations show that when driven by a 12 V electromotive force, the BO-OA reaches the fusible alloy melting point of 138 degrees C within 320 mu s and can realize electrical conduction within 33 mu s. 0.45 mg of copper azide can generate a 3.27 GPa detonation wave within 5.9 mu s at 0.3 mm in the air domain to realize the physical self-destruction of the ISC. This scheme can greatly improve the safety of the energetic materials and provides strong practical value for information self-destruction.",2023
High-accuracy measurement of the heat of detonation with good robustness by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of energetic materials,"The heat of detonation of energetic materials (EMs) is determined by the release of chemical energy, bond energies, and chemical structures and can be reflected by the variation of emission intensities in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Herein, we propose a new method based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, combined with small-sample machine learning, to accurately determine the heat of detonation by consuming small-dose samples. A statistical correction strategy is applied to improve the spectral quality and extract spectral features including the emission peak intensity and emission shape correlation intensity. Thereby, a high-accuracy quantitative model based on the plasma spectra is developed to predict the heat of detonation with RMSEC = 0.0314 kJ g(-1) and R-c(2) = 0.99. Excellent model robustness is verified through three independent tests at different dates, which exhibit a strong predictive power with RMSET ' = 0.1776, 0.1217, and 0.1207 kJ g(-1) and R-T '(2) = 0.98, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively. The elements of importance for analysis in the model further clarify that the quantitative diagnosis of the heat of detonation for EMs makes sense by LIBS. Therefore, this work can significantly facilitate the safe and fast determination of the heat of detonation of explosives in small-dosage samples.",2023
Excitation of the anomalous-fluctuating physical fields and existential micro-structures in the burning wave of the energetic materials,"The problem of excitation of the anomalous-fluctuating physical fields and existential periodic micro-structures at ignition and burning of the energetic materials is one of the major problems arising at designing of the solid propulsion systems for various aerospace applications. Understanding and dynamic modeling of oscillatory response of the energetic materials combustion zone cannot be achieved until the combustion zone itself is properly characterized. Till today unified theory is not available mainly due to difficulty in probing thin reaction zones, whose dimensions changes with change in pressure condition in the solid propulsion system. During the last few years, all new and new researchers informed that on the burning surface of the energetic materials are observed the periodic micro-structures like a micro-torches. Both the experiment, and the theory confirms, that the spatial-periodic microstructures excitation is rather universal phenomenon. The present work focuses on one of the critical events, namely on the spatial-periodic micro-structures excitation in the evaporated energetic materials liquid-viscous layer. Suggested mechanism of the spatial-periodic micro-structures excitation in the evaporated energetic materials liquid-viscous layer opens possibility for understanding a very complex phenomenon in the area of the energetic materials on the new qualitative level. From principle-new positions are considered the fundamental physical phenomena, traditionally considered at the energetic materials decomposition in the unstable burning wave. In particular, essentially new explanation of the well-known mechanism of bubbles motion in the thin liquid-viscous layer, connected with excitation of unstable electro-magnetic fields and electric charges transport is given. In accordance with existing representations, the ""negative erosion"" phenomenon is the exclusively gas-dynamic effect which has been not connected with processes in the liquid-viscous layer of burning energetic material. However, the concept that is considered in the paper, allows consider the given phenomenon from the new, more realistic positions. Additional task of the given research consists in obtaining of additional confirmations of reality of the concept of excitation of the existential micro-structures in the burning wave.",2007
Synthesis and characterization of potential polycyclic energetic materials using bicyclic triazole and azetidine structures as building blocks,"Exploring the design strategy of new energetic materials is crucial to promote the development of energetic materials. In this study, a method for designing polycyclic energetic materials is proposed by combining the azetidine structure with azobis-1,2,4-triazole or bi-1,2,4-triazole. A series of typical triazolyl polycyclic compounds were designed and synthesized by simple nucleophilic reaction, which included 5,5 '- dichloro-3,3 '-bis(3,3 '-difluoroazetidine)-4,4 '-azobis-1,2,4-triazole (1), 5,5 '-dichloro-3,3 '-bis(3,3 '- difluoroazetidine)-4,4 '-bi-1,2,4-triazole (2), 5,5 '-dichloro-3-(N,N-dimethyl)-3 '-(3,3 '-difluoroazetidine)-4,4 '-bi-1,2,4-triazole (3) 5,5 '-dichloro-3,3 '-bis(3,3 '-dinitroazetidine)-4,4 '-bi-1,2,4-triazole (4), 5,5 '- dichloro-3-(N,N-dimethyl)-3 '-(3,3 '-dinitroazetidine)-4,4 '-bi-1,2,4-triazole (5), and 5,5 '-diazido-3,3 '- bis(3,3 '-difluoroazetidine)-4,4 '-azo-1,2,4-triazole (6). These designed and synthesized polycyclic compounds (1, 2, 3) have high decomposition temperatures (> 200 degrees C). The molecular van der Waals surface electrostatic potentials suggested the reactivity of compounds 1, 2, and 3 when attacked by nucleophiles. The natural bond orbital and Hirshfeld surface analysis proved the essential reason for the stability of these compounds in theory. The formula design example suggests that some triazolyl polycyclic compounds (4, 5, and 6) are potentially explosives, suggesting that this strategy is feasible for constructing the triazolyl polycyclic energetic compounds.",2023
"2-(1,2,4-triazole-5-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole as a novel building block for energetic materials","The exploration of novel nitrogen-rich heterocyclic building blocks is of importance in the field of energetic materials. A series of 2-(1,2,4-triazole-5-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives based on a new energetic skeleton have been first synthesized by a simple synthetic strategy. All three compounds are well-characterized by IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The compounds 5 and 8 are further characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. 8 and its salts (8a-8c) possess relative high decomposition temperature and low sensitivity, while 5 exhibits low decomposition temperature and high sensitivity. According to EXPLO5 calculation results of detonation performance, both 5 and 8 display acceptable detonation velocities (D) of 8450 m/s and 8130 m/s and detonation pressures (P) of 31.6 GPa and 29.2 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, 5 containing a rare diazonium ylide structure shows high impact sensitivity (4.5 J), making it has a potential as a primary explosive.",2022
"Modeling of explosives: 1,4,2,3,5,6-dioxatetrazinane as a new green energetic material with enhanced performance","Crystal structure prediction and characterization data have been computed for two novel carbon-free energetic compounds, namely 1,4,2,3,5,6-dioxatetrazinane (DOTZ) and its 2,5-dinitro derivative (DNDOTZ). Dynamic and mechanical stability of these crystalline materials at ambient pressure has been confirmed. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirmed thermal stability of DOTZ at 298 K and of DNDOTZ at 77 K. A comprehensive spectral characterization (IR, Raman, UV/Vis, NMR) has been performed to provide information for future experimental identification. The parent molecule exhibits powerful detonation properties, which exceed those of most compounds hitherto obtained experimentally or predicted theoretically. Meanwhile, DNDOTZ is predicted to be an effective solid oxidant for common explosives with negative oxygen balance, such as TNT, TNB, DATB, and TATB. Such mixtures demonstrate better propulsive properties than corresponding mixtures of these explosives with gaseous oxygen. By virtue of its zero oxygen balance, the only detonation products of DOTZ are environmentally friendly molecular nitrogen and water. Therefore, this compound is of great potential interest for further energetic applications.",2020
Bulk detection of explosives and development of customized metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors for the identification of energetic materials,"Based on previous work, a setup allowing discrimination between energetic and non-energetic materials was developed. In order to cover novel materials not yet included in databases, a library free approach was chosen. The evaluation of explosion hazards for solid and liquid samples in the lowest milligram range was carried out by relying on the response of the substances towards thermal activation rather than on their chemical nature. The reaction was monitored by a combination of metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors, photodiodes and a pressure sensor. Utilization of ambient air as a carrier gas and indirect control over sample weight by the geometry of the heater allow uncomplicated handling under real working conditions. In the first phase readily available physical and chemical sensors were applied. The rate of correct assignments was 99.8% with no false negatives and only 1 false positive out of 475 experiments. The possibility of library free operation was also confirmed by an additional series of experiments on materials not used for training the system. In the second phase the readily available MOX gas sensors were replaced by custom designed ones, which allowed single substances and classes of energetic materials by means to be discriminated by means of principal component analysis (PCA).

High-resolution simulations of cylindrical void collapse in energetic materials: Effect of primary and secondary collapse on initiation thresholds,Void collapse in energetic materials leads to hot spot formation and enhanced sensitivity. Much recent work has been directed towards simulation of collapse-generated reactive hot spots. The resolution of voids in calculations to date has varied as have the resulting predictions of hot spot intensity. Here we determine the required resolution for reliable cylindrical void collapse calculations leading to initiation of chemical reactions. High-resolution simulations of collapse provide new insights into the mechanism of hot spot generation. It is found that initiation can occur in two different modes depending on the loading intensity: Either the initiation occurs due to jet impact at the first collapse instant or it can occur at secondary lobes at the periphery of the collapsed void. A key observation is that secondary lobe collapse leads to large local temperatures that initiate reactions. This is due to a combination of a strong blast wave from the site of primary void collapse and strong colliding jets and vortical flows generated during the collapse of the secondary lobes. The secondary lobe collapse results in a significant lowering of the predicted threshold for ignition of the energetic material. The results suggest that mesoscale simulations of void fields may suffer from significant uncertainty in threshold predictions because unresolved calculations cannot capture the secondary lobe collapse phenomenon. The implications of this uncertainty for mesoscale simulations are discussed in this paper.,2017
Molecule Empowerment and Crystal Desensitization: A Multilevel Structure-Property Analysis toward Designing High-Energy Low-Sensitivity Layered Energetic Materials,"Layered energetic materials (LEMs) can effectively balance energy and mechanical sensitivity, making them a current research focus in the field of energetic materials. However, the influence of the layered stacking pattern on impact sensitivity is still unclear, leading to the lack of advanced design strategies for high-energy low-sensitivity LEMs. Herein, we first utilize novel indicators such as maximum plane separation and hydrogen bond dimension to perform high-throughput screening on over 10(6) candidate structures, resulting in 17 target crystals. A systematic analysis was then conducted on the relationships between the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the weakest energy-storing bond at the molecular level, the intralayer hydrogen bond energy (HBE), and the sliding energy barrier (SEB) at the crystal level with impact sensitivity. The findings suggest that a material can have low sensitivity only if at least two of the three properties perform well, and the interlayer sliding resistance can be reduced by enhancing the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions, which reasonably explains the experimental phenomena. More importantly, we developed a prediction model for the impact sensitivity of LEMs with a coefficient of determination of 0.88. Additionally, factors affecting HBE and SEB were identified, and a linear model was established based on molecular-level feature variables. Finally, a new strategy for designing high-energy low-sensitivity LEMs was proposed, namely, empowerment at the molecular scale and desensitization at the crystal scale. This study integrates high-throughput screening, multilevel structure-property relationship analysis, and mathematical model construction, offering new perspectives for the development of novel high-energy and low-sensitivity energetic materials.",2024
Compression Behavior and Vibrational Properties of New Energetic Material LLM-105 Analyzed Using the Dispersion-Corrected Density Functional Theory,"The 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a newly energetic material with an excellent performance and low sensitivity and has attracted considerable attention. On the basis of the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D), the high-pressure responses of vibrational properties, in conjunction with structural properties, are used to understand its intermolecular interactions and anisotropic properties under hydrostatic and uniaxial compressions. At ambient and pressure conditions, the DFT-D scheme could reasonably describe the structural parameters of LLM-105. The hydrogen bond network, resembling a parallelogram shape, links two adjacent molecules and contributes to the structure stability under hydrostatic compression. The anisotropy of LLM-105 is pronounced, especially for Raman spectra under uniaxial compression. Specifically, the red-shifts of modes are obtained for [100] and [010] compressions, which are caused by the pressure-induced enhance of the strength of the hydrogen bonds. Importantly, coupling modes and discontinuous Raman shifts are observed along [010] and [001] compressions, which are related to the intramolecular vibrational redistribution and possible structural transformations under uniaxial compressions. Overall, the detailed knowledge of the high-pressure responses of LLM-105 is established from the atomistic level. Uniaxial compression responses provide useful insights for realistic shock conditions.",2021
"Construction of Coplanar Bicyclic Backbones for 1,2,4-Triazole-1,2,4-Oxadiazole-Derived Energetic Materials","Combining different nitrogen-rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine-tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4-oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4-triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3-(5-Amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino-functionalized N-(5-(5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)nitramide (6) and N-(5-(5-(nitramino)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen-rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4-triazole-1,2,4-oxadiazole-derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7 c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.",2021
Anisotropic Impact Sensitivity of Metal-Free Molecular Perovskite High-Energetic Material (C,"Density functional theory simulations were carried out to investigate energetic molecular perovskite (C6H14N2)(NH2NH3)(ClO4)(3) which was a new type energetic material promising for future application. The electronic properties, surface energy, and hydrogen bonding of (100), (010), (011), (101), (111) surfaces were studied, and the anisotropic impact sensitivity of these surfaces were reported. By comparing the values of the band gaps for different surface structures, we found that the (100) surface has the lowest sensitivity, while the (101) surface was considered to be much more sensitive than the others. The results for the total density of states further validated the previous conclusion obtained from the band gap. Additionally, the calculated surface energy indicated that surface energy was positively correlated with impact sensitivity. Hydrogen bond content of the surface structures showed distinct variability according to the two-dimensional fingerprint plots. In particular, the hydrogen bond content of (100) surface was higher than that of other surfaces, indicating that the impact sensitivity of (100) surface is the lowest.",2022
"Selecting Suitable Substituents for Energetic Materials Based on a Fused Triazolo-[1,2,4,5]tetrazine Ring","The more energetic substituent introduced, such as nitramino, nitro, azido, and N-oxide group, the better the detonation performance but the lower the stability of the compounds obtained. In order to synthesize energetic materials that display both high detonation performance and low sensitivity, it is useful to understand how those energetic groups affect material properties. The syntheses of some materials based on the triazolo[1,2,4,5]tetrazine fused ring that contain combinations of different energetic groups are described. For the first time, a fused ring containing the nitramino and the N-oxide groups was synthesized (3). Compound 3 and its salts exhibit high densities (>1.82 g cm(-3) ) and detonation performances (>9047 m s(-1) , > 34.7 GPa) as well as acceptable sensitivities. As a result of hydrogen bonding, the hydrazinium salt (3b) has a density of 1.83 g cm(-3), with a high detonation velocity (9470 m s(-1)) and reasonable sensitivities (12 J, 120 N) which is superior to CL-20. Comparisons are made with our previously reported materials in order to demonstrate how energetic substituents affect properties.",2020
Phenomenon of Negative Erosion and Excitation of the Cellular Spatial-Periodic Micro-Structure at the Energetic Materials Unsteady Combustion,"The phenomenon of reduction of the burning rate as a result of blowing of the solid propellant burning surface with small velocity of the combustion products of the same composition refers to as the effect of ""negative erosion"". The phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is one of typical anomalies of burning. Understanding of the mechanism of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is important from the point of view of formation of correct representations about fundamental laws of burning of the energetic materials. In the paper the new concept of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is suggested. Earlier it was assumed, that the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is exclusively gas-dynamics effect. which has not been connected with the processes in the liquid-viscous layer of the burning solid propellant. ""Wandering"" micro-torches on the burning surface causes excitation of the micro-vortex cells - periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures. Suggested new concept of the phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is developed on the basis of the universal concept of the spatial-periodic micro-structures excitation on the energetic material burning surface, for the first time suggested in author's papers and opens new possibilities for guidance by processes in the burning wave of the energetic materials. The phenomenon of ""negative erosion"" is the most frequently observed in the solid propulsion systems with the charges having two and more coaxial channels.",2008
Effect of the concentration ratio on energetic and exergetic performance of concentrating solar collectors with integrated transparent insulation materials,"The effect of the concentration ratio on the performance of parabolic trough and central receiver collectors with integrated transparent insulation materials (TIMs) is analyzed in this work. A model based on optical, energy, and exergy analyses is developed to determine thermal and second law efficiencies of concentrated solar collectors as a function of the absorber temperature and concentration ratio. The results are compared with the respective traditional collector configurations without TIM. In general, high concentration ratios are fundamental to maintain high efficiencies. The incorporation of a TIM into concentrated solar collectors leads to higher thermal efficiencies at high operating temperatures even at low concentration ratios. An equivalent second law efficiency to that of the reference collector configuration can be achieved at lower concentration ratios by incorporating a TIM in parabolic trough or a TIM and a glass envelope in central receiver collectors. The idea of using a TIM deserves further exploration as it seems to be a promising alternative that contributes to a more efficient and cost-effective technology.",2019
"Electronic, Magnetic, Structural and Energetic Properties of 2D Materials, Solids and Surface/Interfaces with Applications for Catalysis and Optoelectronics","Understanding the perplexing properties of materials is one of the most challenging goals in the material science community. Regularly scientists use theoretical approaches to find justifiable answers, where approximations are typically unavoidable. Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as one of the most successful tools in this regard. However, the accuracy of a DFT calculation is determined by the employed exchange correlation approximation. The accuracy usually can be improved by using more sophisticated exchange correlation approximations, that are typically accompanied with higher computational cost. This Phd dissertation focuses on three projects in terms of DFT development and applications: 1) developing a new density functional to accurately predict chemi- and physi-sorptions of molecules on solid surfaces simultaneously for heterogeneous catalysis; 2) testing the newly developed numerically stable r2SCANdensity functional on thermodynamic stability of solids; and 3) computationally assisted high-throughput discovery of a novel 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor. For the first project, we developed a new density functional for accurately predicting molecular adsorption energies on solid surfaces. Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science, in particular for heterogeneous catalysis. Accurately and efficiently modeling the adsorption has been a challenging task as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formation and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory is the choice for describing such reaction while its approximations usually encounter difficulties in simultaneously capturing chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that achieves this goal by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and the Ar2 binding energy curve with minimal empiricism. This functional is not only accurate for 39 systems of molecular adsorptions on transition metal surfaces but also predicts the double minima of graphene on Ni(111) surface. Our work therefore opens a door for accurate and efficient modeling of molecular adsorption for general systems. For the second project, we tested the performance of r2SCANdensity functional for the stability of solids, which is assessed by comparing calculated and experimentally-determined enthalpies of formation and decomposition. The revision of the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) balances numerical stability with high general accuracy. In this thesis, we evaluated the formation and decomposition enthalpies, equilibrium volumes, and fundamental band gaps of 1015 solids using r2SCAN, SCAN, and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA, as well as the dispersion-corrected variants SCAN + rVV10 and r2SCAN+ rVV10. Comparisons with experimental data show that r2SCAN has not only retained the accuracy of SCAN but also outperforms SCAN for transition metal intermetallics. The recent realization of 2D magnetism in vdWs materials holds assurance for future spintronics and memory devices. In particular, vdW semiconducting antiferromagnets, which remain rare, are important in developing 2D magnetic devices with new functionalities due to the possibility of controlling both charge and spin as carriers. In the third project, we performed high-throughput computational screening to the metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPTs) family MM'P2X6 compounds where M and M' are transition metal, e.g., Cd, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Zn, and X is a chalcogenide such as S, Se. Firstly, the stable MM'P2X6 compounds were screened by ab initio free energy calculations. In the screened compounds, the CdFeP2Se6was extensively studied, which led to the discovery of a thermodynamically stable semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic ground state. Secondly, the synthesis efforts were carried out and yielded large layered CdFeP2Se6 single crystals. Our experimental studies reveal that CdFeP2Se6 crystals exhibit the short-range antiferromagnetic order at TN= 21K. Moreover, the optical measurements indicate the material has an indirect band gap of 2.23eV. In addition, we also demonstrate that CdFeP2Se6 single crystals can be thinned down to 2D atomic few layers through microexfoliation. These results demonstrate that bulk CdFeP2Se6 is a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, confirming our theoretical predictions and implying that the high-throughput computational search be an effective method for realizing 2D magnetic materials.",2022
Fused rings with ,"Oxidation reactions of 3,6-diamino-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazine give four N-oxide compounds.

Resulting from pi-pi stacking interactions between the fused rings, compounds 1-3 are impact and friction insensitive, are thermally stable and have good density.",2019
Shorter arms count: The energetic costs of raw material catchment in a new experimental approach at Sierra de Atapuerca,"A bioenergetic approach has been increasingly used to address key issues in palaeobiology and palaeocology. An experimental study aimed to quantify the energetic costs of quartzite catchment at Sierra de Atapuerca is presented here. Furthermore, several anthropometric and body composition variables related to energy expenditure were also taken. All these data were used to quantify and test some adaptive hypotheses, on the basis of the influence of upper and lower limb length on energy expenditure during transport. Furthermore, the experimental data were used to obtain a predictive equation to estimate energy expenditure in fossil hominins during this activity. It is proposed that the cost of lithic raw materials catchment could exert a selective pressure on the emergence of some features in the genus Homo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Design and synthesis of energetic materials towards high density and positive oxygen balance by ,"A new N-functionalized strategy of nitrogen heterocycles was utilized for the synthesis of nitroazole-based energetic materials, giving rise to a new family of highly dense and oxygen-rich energetic materials. They were characterized by IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, DSC, and X-ray diffraction. These new molecules exhibit high densities, moderate to good thermal stabilities, acceptable impact and friction sensitivities, and excellent detonation properties, which suggest potential applications as energetic materials or oxidizers. Interestingly, among tetrazole-based CHNO energetic materials compound 5 has the highest measured density of 1.97 g cm(-3) to date. 5c is the first and the only heterocyclic CHNO energetic salt with a positive OB until now. Compounds 5 and 6 exhibit excellent detonation properties (38.5 GPa, 9.22 km s(-1); 37.0 GPa, 9.05 km s(-1)), comparable to the highly explosive HMX. With high OB, the specific impulses of 5, 5b, 5c, and 6c are superior to those of AP and ADN as neat compounds, and the ratio of oxidizer/aluminium/PBAN (%) is 80 : 20 : 0 or 80 : 13 : 7. Furthermore, computational results, BDEs, Mulliken charges and Wiberg bond orders also support the superior qualities of the newly prepared compounds and the design strategy.",2016
Pressure-Induced Irreversible Phase Transition in the Energetic Material Urea Nitrate: Combined Raman Scattering and X-ray Diffraction Study,"In situ high-pressure Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been employed to investigate the behavior of the energetic material urea nitrate ((NH2)(2)COH+center dot NO3-, UN) up to the pressure of similar to 26 GPa. UN exhibits the typical supramolecular structure with the uronium cation and nitrate anion held together by multiple hydrogen bonds in the layer. The irreversible phase transition in the range similar to 9-15 GPa has been corroborated by experimental results and is proposed to stem from rearrangements of hydrogen bonds. Further analysis of XRD patterns indicates the new phase (phase II) has Pc symmetry. The retrieved sample is similar to 10.6% smaller than the ambient phase (phase I) in volume owing to the transformation from two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-bonded networks to three-dimensional (3D) ones. The mechanism for the phase transition involves the cooperativity of noncovalent interactions under high pressure and distortions of the layered structure. This work suggests high pressure is an efficient technique to explore the performance of energetic materials, and to synthesize new phases with high density.",2013
A Physics-Aware Deep Learning Model for Energy Localization in Multiscale Shock-To-Detonation Simulations of Heterogeneous Energetic Materials,"Predictive simulations of the shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) in heterogeneous energetic materials (EM) are vital to the design and control of their energy release and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of the thermo-mechanics of EM during the SDT, both macro-scale response and sub-grid mesoscale energy localization must be captured accurately. This work proposes an efficient and accurate multiscale framework for SDT simulations of EM. We introduce a new approach for SDT simulation by using deep learning to model the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated EM microstructures. The proposed multiscale modeling framework is divided into two stages. First, a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) is used to model the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated heterogeneous EM microstructures. PARC is trained using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of hotspot ignition and growth within microstructures of pressed HMX material subjected to different input shock strengths. After training, PARC is employed to supply hotspot ignition and growth rates for macroscale SDT simulations. We show that PARC can play the role of a surrogate model in a multiscale simulation framework, while drastically reducing the computation cost and providing improved representations of the sub-grid physics. The proposed multiscale modeling approach will provide a new tool for material scientists in designing high-performance and safer energetic materials.",2023
A Circular Economy Approach to Military Munitions: Valorization of Energetic Material from Ammunition Disposal through Incorporation in Civil Explosives,"Ammunition that has reached its end of life or become obsolete is considered hazardous waste due to the energetic material content that must be decommissioned. One of the technologies to dispose of ammunition involves the use of incinerators with sophisticated gas treatment systems; however, this disposal process has important limitations in terms of incinerator capacity, energy requirements and high costs. This article assesses the potential primary energy avoided and environmental benefits arising from the valorization of energetic material from military ammunition by incorporating it into civil emulsion explosives, as an alternative to destructive disposal. This approach follows the circular economy principle, as articulated inter alia in BS 8001:2007, by giving a new service to a residue through its incorporation into a new product. A prospective life-cycle model is implemented based on primary data from previous studies on the conventional disposal process and on the production of emulsion explosive. The model applies system expansion to calculate the environmental burdens avoided when energetic material from ammunition is incorporated into civil explosives. The results show that re-using ammunition through valorization of energetic material greatly reduces the environmental impacts in all categories compared to the conventional disposal process. The benefits arise mainly from avoiding the incineration and flue gas treatment processes in ammunition disposal, and displacing production of civil explosive components with the energetic material from ammunition.",2019
"A review on the high energy oxidizer ammonium dinitramide: Its synthesis, thermal decomposition, hygroscopicity, and application in energetic materials","Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) is considered as a potential substitute for ammonium perchlorate in energetic materials due to its high density, positive oxygen balance, and halogen-free characteristics. However, its application has been severely limited because of its strong hygroscopicity, difficult storage, and incompatibility with isocyanate curing agents. In order to better bloom the advantages of the highly energetic and environment-friendly ADN in the fields of energetic materials, an in-depth analysis of the current situation and discussion of key research points are particularly important. In this paper, a detailed overview on the synthesis, thermal decomposition, hygroscopic mechanism, and anti -hygroscopicity of ADN has been discussed, its application in powdes and explosives are also pre-sented, and its future research directions are proposed.(c) 2022 China Ordnance Society.

"Alkali metal salts of 3,6-dinitramino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine: promising nitrogen-rich energetic materials","The alkali metal salts of 3,6-dinitramino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DNAT, 1), Li-2(H2O)(4)(DNAT) (2), Na-2(H2O)(3)(DNAT) (3), K-2(H2O).DNAT) (4), Rb-2(DNAT) (5) and Cs-2(DNAT) (6) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All of these alkali metal salts possess higher thermal stability (from 240.9 degrees C to 260.0 degrees C) than that of DNAT substrate (108.3 degrees C) due to their numerous coordination bonds and the three-dimensional network structures of the complexes. The number of coordination water molecules, the atomic radius of metal and the different packing forms of the crystal structure contribute to the different thermal stabilities of the alkali metal salts. The experimental (constant-volume) energy of combustion values range from 1331 to 1531 kJ mol(-1). The compounds 1, 4, 5, and 6 are sensitive to impact and friction.",2019
Design and synthesis of phenylene-bridged isoxazole and tetrazole-1-ol based energetic materials of low sensitivity,"A variety of phenylene-bridged isoxazole and tetrazole-1-ol based green energetic materials was synthesized, for the first time, in good to excellent yields. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectroscopic techniques, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. The value of the present work is that all newly synthesized compounds have good thermal stabilities ranging between 167-340 degrees C and acceptable densities between 1.51 g cm(-3) to 1.82 g cm(-3). Detailed computational insight into the energetic properties of the new compounds shows that they have good energetic properties (propulsive and ballistic) with excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities which makes them promising candidates for solid propulsion systems.

"Facile synthesis of thermally stable tetrazolo[1,5-","Various thermally stable energetic materials with high nitrogen content, low sensitivity and better detonation performance were synthesized. The versatile functionalization of 1,2,4-triazine involving the introduction of oxadiazole and tetrazole is discussed. All the compounds were fully characterized using IR, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Compounds 2, 3, 9 and 12 were further verified using single-crystal X-ray analysis. Compound 9 can be considered a melt-cast explosive due to its lower onset melting temperature (112 degrees C). The detonation velocity, pressure, density, and heat of formation of all the synthesized compounds range between 7056 and 8212 m s(-1), 17.57 and 23.78 GPa, 1.70 and 1.81 g cm(-1), and 43 and 644 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Due to the high nitrogen percentage (53 to > 72%), these molecules can be used in car airbag applications. Due to the high thermal stability (> 220 degrees C) and lower sensitivity, these compounds can be potentially used as high-performing thermally stable secondary energetic materials.",2023
Characterization of dynamic compressive strength and impact release energy of Al/PTFE energetic materials reinforced by aluminum honeycomb skeleton,"The insufficient dynamic compressive strength of the Al/PTFE energetic material with traditional ingredients has seriously restricted its application in the field of national defence. However, the improvement of strength must be at the expense of activity. In view of the contradiction, this paper pioneers aluminum honeycomb skeleton reinforcement method to achieve both strength and activity. On the basis of traditional ingredients Al/PTFE (mass percentage of 26.5%/73.5%), three types of energetic materials were prepared by cold pressing sintering process by adding different aluminum honeycomb skeletons with arm lengths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The dynamic compressive strengths of the specimen are obtained by using self-built Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) loading system and high-speed camera acquisition system. Meanwhile, the impact reaction release energies are also evaluated experimentally by using the one-stage light gas gun loading system combined with the transient optical fiber pyrometer measurement system, the overpressure measurement system and the infrared thermal imager measurement system. In term of dynamic compressive strength and impact reaction release energy, the performances of three types of Aluminum honeycomb reinforced energetic material were compared with those of traditional ingredients energetic material. The experimental results show that compared with the strength (25.17 MPa) of traditional ingredients Al/PTFE energetic material, the strengths of three kinds of energetic materials reinforced by aluminum honeycomb framework with arm lengths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm are 1.5, 3.1 and 2.2 times that of the traditional ingredients Al/PTFE, respectively; Especially, at the impact velocity of 510 m/s, the release energy of three kinds of Al/PTFE energetic materials reinforced by aluminum honeycomb framework with arm lengths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm were 2.52 kJ/g, 1.94 kJ/g and 2.40 kJ/g, respectively. However, the release energy of traditional ingredients Al/PTFE energetic material was only 1.85 kJ/g. Compared with the traditional ingredients Al/PTFE, the compressive strengths and release energies of three kinds of energetic materials reinforced by different arm lengths of Aluminum honeycomb were significantly improved under the same impact conditions.",2020
Molecular Theory of Detonation Initiation: Insight from First Principles Modeling of the Decomposition Mechanisms of Organic Nitro Energetic Materials,"This review presents a concept, which assumes that thermal decomposition processes play a major role in defining the sensitivity of organic energetic materials to detonation initiation. As a science and engineering community we are still far away from having a comprehensive molecular detonation initiation theory in a widely agreed upon form. However, recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods allow for a constructive and rigorous approach to design and test the theory or at least some of its fundamental building blocks. In this review, we analyzed a set of select experimental and theoretical articles, which were augmented by our own first principles modeling and simulations, to reveal new trends in energetic materials and to refine known existing correlations between their structures, properties, and functions. Our consideration is intentionally limited to the processes of thermally stimulated chemical reactions at the earliest stage of decomposition of molecules and materials containing defects.",2016
Global stability analysis of gasless flames propagating in a cylindrical sample of energetic material: Influence of radiative heat-losses,Axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric gasless flames propagating in a narrow cylindrical sample of an energetic material are considered. The work is focused on the impact of radiative heat-losses from the outer surface of the slab on the flame structure and stability. A typical C-shaped response curve is found with two different flame velocities in the case of axisymmetric flames where the slowest velocity represents an unstable solution. Global linear stability analysis of such flames is performed. It is demonstrated that an increase in heat-losses promotes the flame instabilities for values of the Zel'dovich number lower than in the cases with the heat-losses neglected. The results of the stability analysis are successfully compared with the results of direct three-dimensional calculations showing oscillatory and spinning propagation of the gasless combustion waves.

Thermal stability of emerging N6-type energetic materials: kinetic modeling of simultaneous thermal analysis data to explain sensitivity trends,"A number of new high-performing energetic materials possess explosophoric functionalities, high nitrogen content, and fused heterocyclic blocks. Two representatives of these materials have been synthesized recently, namely, 1,2,9,10-tetranitrodipyrazolo[1,5-d:5',1'-f][1,2,3,4]-tetrazine (1) and 2,9dinitrobis([1,2,4]triazolo)[1,5-d:5',1'-f][1,2,3,4]tetrazine (2). The thermal stability of these energetic materials bearing the N-N-N = N-N-N fragment and three closely related compounds has been investigated for the first time. The thermal decomposition process of analyzed compounds was complicated by the appearance of the liquid phase, sublimation of the material, and autocatalysis by reaction products. In contrast to the traditional approach to the kinetic modeling based on data from either TGA or DSC, we use both signals' data measured at the same time and perform the joint kinetic analysis using the model-fitting technique to obtain the pertinent kinetic description of the process. Of the analyzed materials, 1 and 2 show the lowest thermal stability in melt with a characteristic rate constant of 2.6 x 10-3 s-1 at 250 1C. The kinetic parameters and calculated detonation performance data were used in the model to describe the mechanical sensitivity. The model output and the experimental friction sensitivity data show a respectable agreement, but more data are required to draw firm conclusions. In general, the provided thermal stability and kinetic data can be used for thermal response and storage modeling of these new N6-type energetic materials. The developed thermokinetic approach, joint model-fitting of several thermal analysis signals, can be applied to other complex thermally induced processes to increase the value and credibility of the kinetic findings.",2023
"New High Pressure Phases of Energetic Material TEX: Evidence from Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and First-Principles Calculations","Samples of energetic material TEX (C6H6N4O8) are studied using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) up to 27 GPa pressure. There are clear changes in the Raman spectra and XRD patterns around 2 GPa related to a conformational change in the TEX molecule, and a phase transformation above 11 GPa. The molecular structures and vibrational frequencies of TEX are calculated by density functional theory based Gaussian 09W and CASTEP programs.

"2,3,5,6-Tetra(1","A synthetic protocol was developed to create a unique nitrogen-rich (71.58% N) energetic material, namely, 2,3,5,6-tetra(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazine (H4TTP).

H4TTP was isolated and characterized using mass spectrometry, multinuclear (H-1, C-13) NMR spectroscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy (IR, Raman). The molecular structure was determined via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. High nitrogen content and relative planarity of the molecule, along with the attained properties such as hydrolytic stability, high thermal stability, density, detonation velocity, and its facile synthesis, make H4TTP a highly interesting energetic material.",2018
"Synthesis and Properties of Novel Thermally Stable and Insensitive 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole-based Energetic Materials","Two novel thermally stable and insensitive 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole-based energetic compounds, namely 1,4-bis(2',4',6'-trinitrophenyl)-dinitro[4,3-c]pyrazole (DTNBDNP) and 1,4-bis(2',4'-dinitrophenyl)-3,6-dinitro[4,3-c]pyrazole (DDNBDNP) were firstly reported. DTNBDNP and DDNBDNP were synthesized via the condensation reaction and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DTNBDNP and DDNBDNP decompose exothermically at 407.5 degrees C and 372.5 degrees C, respectively. Based on the densities and calculated heats of formation, the detonation properties were carried out using Gaussian 09 program and Kamlet-Jacobs equations, which were comparable with those of commonly thermally stable energetic materials, such as HNS and TATB. Results showed that polynitro-aromatic substituted 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole-based materials had the potential to be useful as new heat-resistant energetic compounds.",2018
Infrared spectroscopy to study ultrafast vibrational dynamics of select energetic materials and the electrostatic interactions of biologically relevant systems,"In this body of work, many tools to vibrational spectroscopy are presented. The techniques discussed include: transient absorption (pump-probe) spectroscopy, vibrational echo spectroscopy, and novel methods of internal Stark spectroscopy. Time dependent ultrafast infrared spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the inter- and intra-molecular interactions within various energetic materials while very novel Stark spectroscopy results of biologically relevant porphyrins are also demonstrated. The first vibrational relaxation studies on many different energetic materials are presented, while a temperature dependent pump probe study was performed on a more exotic and recently de-classified material. Picosecond infrared pump-probe measurements of the vibrational relaxation of the asymmetric NO 2 stretching mode that absorbs 6.26–6.40 μm (1597–1623 cm −1 ) of TNAZ, RDX, HMX, CL-20 (abbreviations defined later in the text), and nitromethane, are presented. In addition, a temperature dependent study was performed between 50 K and 298 K on TNAZ. All of the lifetimes fall in the range of 2 ps to 6 ps with the exception of nitromethane, which has a lifetime of 16 ps. The temperature dependence of TNAZ is flat and solvent independent, suggesting an intea-molecular relaxation pathway that does not involve low frequency modes. A clearer picture of molecular relaxation, the phonon bath, and the density of states within these systems is also presented. Internal vibrational Stark studies of two Fe (II) Deuteroporphyrins support suggestions that fluctuating electric fields contribute to the dephasing of the CO within the protein pocket. Data is presented that clarifies the coulombic interactions between the equatorial porphyrin substituents, the distal ligand and the CO cause a distinct spectral shift. This data opens a new pathway toward understanding the ability of the bound CO to experience dynamics of the solvent while protected within the protein pocket. An involved treatise into crystal structure, ab-initio estimated charge distribution, chromatic bandshift, and the symbiosis between these leads to very accurate estimates of the Stark tuning rate.",2003
Modification of an ,"The energy and stability properties of energetic materialsare often contradictory to each other (e.g., high energy vs low thermalstability). There is no doubt that it is still challenging to explore the ef-fective balance between energetic performance and molecular stability,especially for melt-castable materials. In this study, we selected the 4-methoxy-3,5-dinitropyrazole framework and a stable nitro group to de-sign a new energetic melt-castable compound, namely 4-methoxy-3,5-dinitro-1-(nitromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (MDNNMP). Compared with the N-methylation product DMDNP and the nitrato-substituted derivativeMC-7, MDNNMP exhibits a better balanced performance, includinggood thermal stability (T-d: 203.7 degrees C), detonation velocity (D-v: 8099 m s-1) and impact sensitivity (20 J). The favorable balanced performance ofMDNNMP suggests that it is a suitable candidate as a high-performancemelt-castable material. Additionally, compared with the nitratomethylgroup, the nitromethyl group demonstrates superior advantages in per-formance regulation.",
Triazole-induced planarization of a twisted tetrazole-based molecule towards energetic materials with improved thermostability and insensitivity,"Pursuing the structural planarization of energetic materials is an efficient method for achieving improved performance. Although many planar energetic molecules have been prepared so far, the innovation of advanced planar explosives still relies on the scientific intuition, experience and trial-and-error of researchers. Now, a triazole-induced planarization strategy is proposed based on the regulation of aromaticity, charge distribution, and hydrogen bonds. The incorporation of a triazole ring into the non-planar molecule 5-amino-1-nitriminotetrazole (VII) results in a planar energetic material named N-[5-amino-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]nitramide (3). Compared with VII (T-d = 85 ? IS < 0.25 J; FS < 5 N), 3 shows remarkably improved thermal stability (T-d = 145 ?) and reduced sensitivities (IS = 20 J; FS > 360 N). The variation of thermal stability and mechanical sensitivity from VII to 3 reflects the effectiveness and superiority of the planarization strategy. Benefiting from the properties of 3, its energetic salt 5 exhibits excellent overall performance (D-v = 9342 m s(-1); P = 31.6 GPa; T-d = 201 ? IS = 20 J; FS = 360 N), which is comparable to that of HMX. Moreover, the triazole-induced planarization strategy may serve as a guide for exploring advanced energetic materials.",2023
Enhancing Energetic Performance of Multinuclear Ag(I)-Cluster MOF-Based High-Energy-Density Materials by Thermal Dehydration,"It is an enormous challenge to construct high-energy-density materials meeting simultaneously requirements of high energy and excellent stability. In this work, the reaction of a Ag(I) ion with a nitrogen-rich ligand, 1H-tetrazole-5-acetic acid (H(2)tza), leads to a novel Ag7-cluster metal-organic framework, [Ag-7(tza)(3)(Htza)(2)(H(2)tza)(H2O)] (1), with remarkable high-energy content, stability, and insensitivity. Dramatically, the heating-dehydrated process of 1 produces a new stable energetic material, [Ag-7(tza)(3)(Htza)(2)(H(2)tza)] (la), which features superior energy and undiminished safety performance compared to those of 1.",2019
Critical parameters of a micro-hotspot model of the laser-pulse initiation of the explosive decomposition of energetic materials,"The work continues a series of studies of the micro-hotspot model a thermal explosion. The dependences of the critical energy fluence and the temperature of the reaction kernel in pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) on the radius of aluminum nanoparticles at half-maximum pulse durations of 10 to 150 ns are calculated. For each pulse duration, there is an optimal nanoparticle radius at which the critical energy fluence is minimal. The dependences of these parameters on the pulse duration are derived. It is shown that there is a universal relationship, independent of the pulse duration, between the normalized critical energy fluence and the nanoparticle radius.",2017
A solvent free nickle(II) compound derived from 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole-2-acetic acid for potential energetic material,"Coordination compounds based on tetrazole compounds may be potential candidates for energetic materials. A solvent free compound with three dimensional network [Ni(pytza)(2)](n) was prepared from a solvothermal reaction by using Hpytza and Ni(ClO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, where Hpytza = 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole-2-acetic acid. This compound was characterized by elemental analysis, IR and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Thermal behavior of the compound was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG). Furthermore, the apparent activation energy (E); Arrhenius equation; critical temperature (T-p); oxygen balance (OB %); entropy of activation (Delta S), enthalpy of activation (Delta H), and free energy of activation (Delta G) of the decomposition process were discussed, as well.

A supramolecular self-assembly material based on cucurbituril and cationic TPE as ultra-sensitive probe of energetic pentazolate salts,"The successful synthesis of the pentazolate anion (cyclo-N-5(-)) has been a great breakthrough in the field of energetic materials. However, the detection methods for these energetic materials based on the pentazolate anion are quite rare. Herein, two fluorescent probes for cyclo-N-5(-) anion were designed. Sensor 1 (TPE2N) was synthesized with a tetraphenylethylene functionalized by two cationic groups which can generate strong electrostatic interactions with pentazolate anion and result in specific fluorescent changes. Sensor 2 was designed based on sensor 1 and supramolecular cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). The unique structural features of CB[7] provide sites for the interaction between the cations and N-5(-) anion in its cavity, which would generate a platform for the detection and enhance the recognition performance. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiment and fluorescence titration experiment indicate the binding molar ratio between sensor 1 with CB[7] is 1:2. Both sensors display typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features and good water-solubility. The sensors demonstrate excellent sensitivity to pentazole hydrazine salt with high enhancement constant (sensor 1: 1.34 x 10(6); sensor 2: 3.78 x 10(6)) and low limit of detection (LOD: sensor 1 = 4.33 mu M; sensor 2 = 1.54 mu M). The formation of an AIE-based supramolecular sensor effectively improves the sensitivity to N-5(-) anion. In addition, the probes also have good selectivity of N-5(-) anion salts. The research would shed some light on the design of novel fluorescent sensors to detect pentazolate-based molecules and provides an example of supramolecular chemistry combined with fluorescent probes.

"Molecular Design and Performance Studies of 4-(1,2,4-Triazole-5-yl) Furazan Derivatives as Promising Energetic Materials","In this paper, eight 4-(1,2,4-triazole-5-y1) furazan (TZFZ) derivatives were designed, and the molecular configurations of TZFZ compounds were optimized by using the B3LYP/6-311+G* level. Meanwhile, the detonation performance, density, impact sensitivity, heat of formation and oxygen balance have been investigated. The results clearly and intuitively illustrate that the introduction of -NO2 and coordination oxygen plays a pivotal role in increasing the density and heat of formation. In summary, the properties of these compounds are better than the traditional explosives RDX and TNT, especially the density and detonation pressure. Energetic evaluations showed that compounds B1 (P = 36.73 GPa; D = 8.98 km.s(-1), p = 1.88 g.cm(-3)) and B7 (P = 38.51 GPa; D = 9.17 km.s(-1), p = 1.90 g.cm(-3)) could be seen as promising candidates of energetic insensitive compounds with remarkable performance.",2021
"Low-temperature heat capacities, standard molar enthalpies of formation and detonation performance of two CL-20 cocrystal energetic materials","Two cocrystals of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) were prepared by a solvent/non-solvent (acetonitrile/distilled water) method at room temperature. The low-temperature heat capacities of CL-20 center dot TNT cocrystal and 2CL-20 center dot HMX cocrystal were measured in the temperature range from 1.9 to 300 K using the heat capacity option of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). By fitting the heat capacity data to a series of theoretical and empirical models, the thermodynamic functions were derived. In addition, the standard molar heat capacities, entropies and enthalpies of cocrystal samples at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa were also obtained. The standard molar energies of combustion of CL-20, TNT, HMX, CL-20 center dot TNT cocrystal, and 2CL-20 center dot HMX cocrystal were determined. From the combustion results, the standard molar enthalpies of combustion and formation for the compounds at T = 298.15 K were derived. The detonation velocity (D) and detonation pressure (P) were obtained by Kamlet-Jacobs equations. 2CL-20 center dot HMX cocrystal shows superior detonation velocity and detonation pressure, which are higher than those of CL-20 center dot TNT cocrystal.

"The role of fluorine in energetic materials, and its impact on long range coupling constants and SN2 – E2 reactions","The role of fluorine has been investigated in three different areas: 1) energetic materials, 2) long range coupling constants and 3) bimolecular substitution and elimination reactions. High fluorine content can enhance the properties of energetic materials. It was demonstrated that the presence of an SF5 substituent within energetic compounds serves to increase their density while diminishing their shock sensitivity, which when combined with other favorable properties of aminofurazans produces a new class of high density- high performance energetic materials. Thermogravimetric analyses (DSC/TGA) as well as qualitative sensitivity tests indicated an improvement in the energetic properties of these new materials. The high fluorine content, combined with low hydrogen content and the presence of sulfur may allow these compounds to release “free fluorine” upon detonation, which could allow such high-energy, SF5-containing furazan derivatives to be useful in combating chemical and biological weapons. Through space coupling of fluorines comprises an interesting aspect of 19 F NMR spectrum. The 19 F NMR spectrum of new monosubstituted perfluoro[2.2]paracyclophanes display unusual 19 F- 19 F coupling patterns ( 4 J and 5 J) that suggest a skewed geometry in which the upper deck moves towards or away from the substituent. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the HF/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/EPR-III level of theory using Gaussian 03, and they shed light on the unusual structures and coupling of F8 and its derivatives. 4 J FF coupling constants were found to be transmitted through the space by direct contact between the electron cloud of the interacting nuclei, while 5 J FF coupling constants were also found to be transmitted through the space, but with help of an intermediate moiety that relays the spin polarization from one fluorine to the other. Finally, a measure of the quantitative effect of proximate fluorine substituents on the rates of S N 2 and E2 reactions has been obtained through a study of reactions on fluorinated n -alkyl bromides with a weak base, strong nucleophile azide ion and strong base/nucleophile methoxide ion in the protic solvent methanol and the aprotic solvent, DMSO. The order of reactivity for SN2 reactions of azide in methanol at 50oC was found to be: n -alkyl-Br > n -alkyl-CHFBr > n -perfluoroalkyl-CH 2 CH 2 Br >> n -perfluoroalkyl-CH 2 Br > n -alkyl-CF 2 Br. The order of reactivity for E2 reactions was found to be: n -perfluoroalkyl-CH 2 CH 2 Br >> n -alkyl-CF 2 Br > n -alkyl-CHFBr > n -alkyl-Br. Quantum chemical calculations support and help to understand these orders of reactivity. (Full text of this dissertation may be available via the University of Florida Libraries web site.

Deformation behavior of steel sheets under dynamic underwater impact: electric-pulse triggered energetic materials loading vs. wire explosion loading,"This paper considers the applicability of high-velocity forming by investigating the compound explosion process of electrical and chemical energy in electric-pulse-triggered energetic materials loading (ETEL). The deformation behavior of DP600 steel sheets during ETEL and wire explosion loading (WEL) is studied by experiments, numerical simulation, and microstructure analysis. The increment of quantized energetic materials (EMs) (0.5 g) on the deformation volume of the sheet is reduced during ETEL, indicating that triggering more EMs at the same discharge energy reduces its energy utilization. The percentage contribution of different discharge energies triggering the same mass of EMs to the deformation volume of the sheet has no effect, with 1.0 g EMs contributing about 35.5%. Compared with WEL specimens of a similar bulging height, an appropriate increase in discharge energy in ETEL is beneficial to improve the energy utilization. The relationships between the kinetic energy, plastic strain energy, stress, and strain of the sheets during ETEL/1.5 g and WEL/5472 J are analyzed by numerical simulation. The results show that ETEL has a smaller stress gradient difference than WEL, indicating that ETEL changes the stress distribution in the deformation zone and expands the strain distribution range. Compared with WEL/5472 J, the low angle grain boundary (LAGB) fraction of ETEL/1.5 g increases, and dislocations are uniformly distributed in the grains and disperse the strain concentration at the grain boundaries. The fracture specimens of ETEL also show multiple necking bands, large and deep dimples, and thicker tear ridges, indicating a significantly higher degree of deformation.",2024
Mesoscale strain and damage sensing in nanocomposite bonded energetic materials under low velocity impact with frictional heating via peridynamics,"The formation of hotspots within polymer bonded explosives can lead to the thermal decomposition and initiation of energetic materials. A frictional heating model is applied at the mesoscale in this study to assess the potential for the formation of hotspots under low velocity impact loadings. The frictional heating mechanism predominantly depends on the formation and growth of microstructural damage within the energetic material. Monitoring of the formation and growth of damage at the mesoscale is considered through the inclusion of piezoresistive carbon nanotube network within the energetic binder providing embedded strain and damage sensing. A coupled multiphysics thermo-electro-mechanical peridynamics framework is developed to perform computational simulations on an energetic material microstructure subject to low velocity impact loads. The coupled framework allows for the assessment of traveling compressive waves caused by impact with piezoresistive sensing, growth of damage with damage sensing and the possible formation of hotspots. The sensing mechanism has been shown to capture the presence of the compressive mechanical wave at different locations within the microstructure before large damage growth. It is observed that the development of hotspots is highly dependent on the impact energy. Higher impact energy leads to larger amounts of microstructural damage providing more damaged surfaces for friction to take place. The higher impact energy also yields larger relative velocities of sliding damage surfaces resulting in more frictional heating. With increase in impact energy, the model also predicts larger amounts of sensing and damage thereby supporting the use of carbon nanotubes to assess damage growth and subsequent formation of hotspots.",2020
Ignition of energetic materials by a high-current electron beam and the effect of irradiation on their thermal sensitivity,The ignition of a powdered nitrocellulose-nitroglycerin composition and its mixtures with lead oxide and zirconium in different ratios by a high-current electron beam is studied. Experimental results on assessing the influence of electron beam irradiation on the thermal sensitivity of the studied energetic materials are reported. It is shown that the key role in the ignition of the materials is played by the cathode flare generated at the cathode after the electron beam.,2015
"Thermal decomposition of energetic materials. 5. reaction processes of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine below its melting point.","Through the use of simultaneous thermogravimetry modulated beam mass spectrometry, optical microscopy, hot-stage time-lapsed microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy measurements, the physical and chemical processes that control the thermal decomposition of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) below its melting point (160-189 degrees C) have been identified. Two gas-phase reactions of RDX are predominant during the early stages of an experiment. One involves the loss of HONO and HNO and leads to the formation of H2O, NO, NO2, and oxy-s-triazine (OST) or s-triazine. The other involves the reaction of NO with RDX to form NO2 and 1-nitroso-3,5-dinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (ONDNTA), which subsequently decomposes to form a set of products of which CH2O and N2O are the most abundant. Products from the gas-phase RDX decomposition reactions, such as ONDNTA, deposit on the surface of the RDX particles and lead to the development of a new set of reaction pathways that occur on the surface of the RDX particles. The initial surface reactions occur on surfaces of those RDX particles in the sample that can accumulate the greatest amount of products from the gas-phase reactions. Initial surface reactions are characterized by the formation of islands of reactivity on the RDX surface and lead to the development of an orange-colored nonvolatile residue (NVR) film on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is most likely formed via the decomposition of ONDNTA on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is a nonstoichiometric and dynamic material, which reacts directly with RDX and ONDNTA, and is composed of remnants from RDX and ONDNTA molecules that have reacted with the NVR. Reactions involving the NVR become dominant during the later stage of the decomposition process. The NVR reacts with RDX to form ONDNTA via abstraction of an oxygen atom from an NO2 group. ONDNTA may undergo rapid loss of N2 and NO2 with the remaining portion of the molecule being incorporated into the dynamic NVR. The dynamic NVR also decomposes and leads to the formation of H2O, CH2O, N2O, NH2CHO, (CH3)2NCHO, (CH3)2NNO, C2H2N2O, and (CH3)3N or CH3NCH2CH3. The competition between reaction of the dynamic NVR with RDX and its own thermal decomposition manifests itself in a rapid increase in the rate of evolution of the NVR decomposition products as the amount of RDX remaining in the sample nears depletion. The reactions between the NVR film and RDX on the surface of the RDX particles leads to a localized environment that creates a layer of molten RDX on the surface of the particles where reactions associated with the liquid-phase decomposition of RDX may occur. The combination of these reaction processes leads to an acceleration of the reaction rate in the later stage of the decomposition process and creates an apparent reaction rate behavior that has been referred to as autocatalytic in many previous studies of RDX decomposition. A reaction scheme summarizing the reaction pathways that contribute to the decomposition of RDX below its melting point is presented.",c-15
Reaction Mechanism of Embedding Oxidizing Small Molecules in Energetic Materials to Improve the Energy by Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Novel host-guest/multicomponent energetic materials can be obtained by embedding hydrogen- or nitrogen-containing oxidizing small molecules between the molecules of high-energy explosives, which can improve their explosive energy. To better understand the mechanism of oxidizing small molecules in the reaction and improve the energy, ReaxFF-lg reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the thermal decomposition reaction at different temperatures of the CL-20/H2O2 solvate formed by embedding H2O2 in the cavity of CL-20. We propose an analytical method to investigate the mechanism of H2O2 in the CL-20 reaction by tracing the interactions between the H and O atoms of H2O2 and the C, H, N, and O atoms of CL-20. During thermal decomposition of CL-20/H2O2 CL-20 and H2O2 first separately decompose, and then, the decomposition products react. The H atoms, O atoms, and hydroxyl (HO) groups generated by H2O2 decomposition connect with the O atoms of nitro groups, leading to N-O bond cleavage. The O atoms generated by H2O2 decomposition connect with C atoms, leading to C-N bond cleavage, which catalyzes 'destruction of the CL-20 cage structure and increases the CL-20 decomposition rate. Eventually, the H and O atoms of H2O2 mainly bond to the O and C atoms of CL-20, respectively, which causes generation of greater amounts of H2O and CO2 and increases the heat released. These mechanisms increase the detonation velocity and pressure of explosives. The proposed analytical method can be used to investigate the reaction mechanisms of other host-guest/multicomponent energetic materials.",2019
Influence of high-reactivity energetic materials on microstructure and performance on iron-based cladding layer under low laser power,"Under low laser power conditions, the cladding layer is constrained by inadequate energy density, resulting in incomplete melting of certain powder particles and the occurrence of defects such as cracks and pores within the layer. This paper utilizes a QT500 substrate and synergistically integrates high-reactivity energetic materials (H-REMs) with metal powder. By external laser energy ignition, the localized combustion of the H-REMs (Al + Fe2O3) is induced, thereby providing additional heat input during the laser cladding process. Through in-depth analysis of extensive experimental data, the influence of H-REMson microstructure and performance of alloy cladding layerhas beenrevealed. The research results demonstrate that the inclusion of H-REMs leads to a 450 K increase in the maximum temperature of the molten pool. By incorporating high-reactivity energetic materials, the energy density utilization of the composite material increased from 0.2663 to 0.7375. The combustion wave generated by H-REMs induces mixing in the molten pool, resulting in cladding layer grain refinement and an average hardness increase of 80 HV1. The friction coefficient decreases from 0.71024 (prior to the addition of H-REMs) to 0.35809, representing a reduction of approximately 49 %.",2024
Influence of the Interface Material Layers and Semiconductor Energetic Disorder on the Open Circuit Voltage in Polymer Solar Cells,"Material layers at electrode/semiconductor interfaces are fundamental for the photovoltaic properties of polymer solar cells. The relationship between open-circuit voltage (V-OC) and the work function (phi) of these interface layers is still a matter of debate. Simulations, together with experiments on over more than 20 cell architectures based on P3HT:PC60BM, enabled us to analyze the physical dependence of V-OC on phi. In particular, when the work function of the contacts is well inside the gap we observe that performance depends strongly on even small variations of phi. On the other hand, when it approaches the energy levels of the semiconducting polymers, device operation becomes the most efficient and less sensitive to variations in phi. Furthermore, by varying the Gaussian density of states (DOS) of the active blend we were able to show that V-OC performance depends significantly also on the DOS. Our study based on the simultaneous variation of transport layers represents a promising method to optimize the design and performance of polymer solar cells. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Generation of Energetic Liquid Jet and Atomization by Pulse Laser Reflection at Inclined Surface of High Refractive Index Material,"In previous studies, we have shown the appreciable reduction of pulse laser ablation threshold by laser beam reflection at the transparent material interface with air. In this study, we have tested a similar situation but using transparent energetic and non-energetic liquids in air. Whole ablation and subsequent atomization processes were observed by Pulse laser shadowgraphy. Minimum laser fluence for laser ablation at water-air interface is found to be around 12-16 Jcm(-2). Several kinds of liquid samples tested in the present study include water, ethanol, engine oil and kerosene. It is found that liquid atomization process is quite similar for several liquid samples, and all the energetic liquids tested can be ignited by a heated NiCr wire above the liquid surface.",2009
"1-(3,5-Dinitro-1","A novel energetic heat-resistant explosive, 1-(3,5-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine (HCPT), has been synthesized along with its salts. An intensive characterization of the compounds is given, including H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The crystal structures of neutral HCPT (3), its triaminoguanidinium salt (10), 3,4,5-triamino-1,2,4-triazolium salt (12), and copper(II) complex (16) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical properties of the compounds, such as density, thermal stability, and sensitivity towards impact and friction were evaluated; all energetic compounds exhibited excellent thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures ranging from 215 degrees C to 340 degrees C, and high positive heats of formation between 622.8 kJ mol(-1) and 1211.7 kJ mol(-1). The detonation pressures and velocities for the energetic compounds were calculated using EXPLO5 (V6.01) based on experimental densities and calculated heats of formation, and the corresponding values were in the ranges of 26.5 GPa to 37.8 GPa and 8236 m s(-1) to 9167 m s(-1). Based on thermal stability values and energetic parameters, compounds 3 and 7 were superior to those of all of the commonly used heat-resistant explosives, which may find potential application as heat-resistant energetic materials.",2016
Volume of detonation determination based on gaseous products of energetic materials by time resolved LIPS combined with schlieren image,"The safe and fast measurement of volume of detonation (VoD) is always a hard task for macroscale explosion even though it is one of the important parameters to evaluate the explosion performance. Therefore, a promising technology to determine the VoD is highly desirable for evaluation of energetic materials. Herein, a new method of VoD determination based on gaseous products via small dose energetic materials by time correlated laser induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS) combined with schlieren image was proposed. Hydrodynamics of products after laser ablation on a time scale ranging from microsecond to millisecond was investigated. Based on the analysis of hydrodynamics of products after laser ablation, the effective spectra of gaseous products of each energetic material are obtained. Subsequently, a high-accuracy quantitative analysis model of VoD based on gaseous products using the method of principal component analysis- partial least squares (PCA-PLS) with small sample modeling algorithm has been developed( R-2>0.96). The VOD model accurately predicts the detonation parameters with the average relative error of test set (ARET) < 3% and the maximum relative error of test set (MRET) < 5%. Moreover, the results without spectra selection of the relative error of blind data show the max relative error is less than 7%. The results of variable importance in projection (VIP) identification indicate a robust association between the spectral signatures of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) and VoD. Furthermore, the N lines exert the most substantial influence on the VoD model. This method provides a new safe and fast determination technology for the evaluation of VoD and clarification of the related mechanism.

Alkaline and Earth Alkaline Energetic Materials Based on a Versatile and Multifunctional 1-Aminotetrazol-5-one Ligand,"In our effort to seek for the ""green"" energetic coordination polymers (CPs), a versatile and multifunctional 1-amino-tetrazol-5-one ligand was synthesized and its complexes with a series of alkaline and earth alkaline metals were prepared and comprehensively characterized. A broad range of differently shaped 1D, 2D, and 3D supramolecular structures for the prepared energetic compounds were found, where each metal was bound in a specific and characteristic fashion. All prepared CPs show very good thermostability, with decomposition temperatures above 236 degrees C and remarkable insensitivity to mechanical impact and friction (impact sensitivity > 40 J, friction sensitivity > 360 N). In terms of detonation performance, our CPs were calculated to have detonation velocities in the range of 6.8-8.1 km.s(-1) and detonation pressures in the range of 16.5-24.5 GPa. Upon their combustion, new materials show a range of characteristic flame colors (from yellow to blue), making these compounds as promising components for various ""green"" pyrotechnic formulations.",2018
Carbon-free energetic materials: computational study on nitro-substituted BN-cage molecules with high heat of detonation and stability,"A new series of high-energy density materials (HEDMs) B6N6H6-n(NO2)(n) (n = 1-6) are studied at the M06-2X/6-311++G**, B97XD/6-311++G** and B3LYP/6-311++G** levels. Analysis of the structural changes caused by substituting the NO2 and the electronic structures, such as electron localization function (ELF), Wiberg bond index (WBI), charge transfer and bond dissociation energies (BDE), provide important insights into the essence of the chemical characteristics and stability. Moreover, the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic (BOMD) simulation is performed to verify their stability, which suggests that only the BN-cage derivatives with one and two nitro groups bonding with boron atoms (NO2-1-1 and NO2-2-1) can remain stable under ambient conditions. To predict the detonation performance and sensitivity of these two stable BN-cage energetic molecules accurately, the density, gas phase enthalpy of formation, enthalpy of sublimation, detonation performance, impact sensitivity and BDE are calculated systematically. The calculation results show that both NO2-1-1 and NO2-2-1 have a higher heat of detonation, higher value of h(50), and larger BDE of trigger bonds than CL-20.",2018
Tuning the Properties of 5-Azido and 5-Nitramino-tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization - General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials,"5-Azido and 5-nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2-(2-azidoethyl)-5-nitraminotetrazoles (2, 2a-2d), as well as 1-nitrato and 1-azidoethyl substituted 5-azidotetrazole (7 and 10) and the methylation products of 5-azidotetrazole (5-azido-1-methyl-tetrazole, 11 and 5-azido-2-methyl-tetrazole, 12) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen-rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X-ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal-free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS-4 M level of theory.",2022

The energetic properties, detonation performance, and sensitivity were studied at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of density functional theory to seek for possible high energy density compounds. The effects of substituent groups on heat of formation (HOF), density rho, detonation velocity D, detonation pressure P, detonation energy Q, and sensitivity (evaluated using oxygen balance OB, the nitro group charges -Q(NO2), and bond dissociation energies BDE were studied and discussed. The order of contribution of the substituent groups to rho, D, and P was -NF2 > -ONO2 > -NO2 > -NHNO2 > -N-3 > -NH2 > -NC > -CN > -CH3; while to HOF is -N-3 > -NC > -CN > -NO2 > -NF2 > -ONO2 > -NH2 > -NHNO2 > -CH3. The trigger bonds in the pyrolysis process for NTNMT derivatives may be N-NO2, N-NH2, N-NHNO2, C-NO2, or O-NO2 varying with the attachment of different substituents. Results show that NTNMT-NHNO2, -NH2, -CN, and -NC derivatives have high detonation performance and good stability. In a word, the oxygen balance at about zero strategy in this work offers new routes for the improvement in properties and stabilities of energetic materials. Graphic abstract In the present paper, several 5-nitro-3-trinitromethyl-1H-1,2,4 triazole (NTNMT) derivatives were designed. Their energetic properties, detonation performance, and sensitivity were studied at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of density functional theory (DFT) to seek for possible high energy density compounds (HEDCs). The different substituents have some changes in the influence on heat of formation (HOF), density rho, detonation velocity D, detonation pressure P, detonation energy Q, and sensitivity.

Green primary energetic materials based on ,"In this study, a series of high-energy-density materials (1 center dot 2H(2)O-9) based on N-(3-nitro-1-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl) nitramide were synthesized and structurally characterized using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal results demonstrated that potassium 3-nitro-5-(nitroimino)-1-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolate hydrate (2 center dot H2O) exhibits an infinite two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) containing the coordination group NO2 and metal cation K+. Additionally, this 2D MOF exhibited a high oxygen content (46.41%) and a positive oxygen balance (14.77%). Heats of formation and the detonation properties of the newly prepared compounds were calculated using the Gaussian 09 and EXPLO 5 programs, respectively. Energetic evaluation indicated that these compounds demonstrate good detonation performances, all of which outperform traditional primary explosives mercury fulminate, lead azide, 2-diazo-4,6-dinitrophenol, and in some cases, even exceed the performance of high explosive RDX. Therefore, the high detonation parameters of the compounds enable these potential primary explosives to trigger the whole detonation easily. Furthermore, several attractive properties, such as an excellent density (2.00 g cm(-3)), an impact sensitivity of 2 J, a friction sensitivity of 32 N, and a low amount of toxic detonation products, make 2 center dot H2O an eco-friendly primary explosive.",2017
"Nitrogen-rich 1, 2-bis(tetrazol-5-yl) ethane and its Carboxylate Derivative for Potential Energetic Materials","Tetrazole and its derivatives with rich nitrogen atoms are usually considered as potential candidates for energetic materials. The different substituents may have an impact on either the rigidity and flexibility or the energetic performance of such compounds. Here, 1,2-bis(tetrazol-5-yl) ethane (H(2)btze) was prepared from succinonitrile and sodium azide from a [2+ 3] cycloaddition reaction, which was further reacted with chloroacetic acid to afford 1, 2-bis(tetrazol-5-yl) ethane diacetic acid (H(2)btzeda). In order to explore their potential as energetic materials, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric- differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) analyses were applied to investigate the thermal decomposition behavior of such compounds. Thermodynamic parameters (DH, DS and DG) and explosion property parameters (critical temperature of thermal explosion, detonation heat, specific volume of explosion, detonation temperature, detonation velocity, detonation pressure, working capacity) were calculated according to literature and the law of thermodynamics base on DSC data. The results show H(2)btze and H(2)btzeda with both high enthalpy can be used as potential energetic materials. Furthermore, H-2 btze has higher specific volume of explosion (943.94 L. kg(-1)) but lower detonation temperature (1994.44 K), compared with trinitrotoluene (TNT).",2016
Refinement of sensitive azides ,"Energetic materials (EMs) have been widely employed in both military and civilian areas for nearly two centuries. The introduction of high-energy azide anions to assemble energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs) is an efficient strategy to enhance energetic properties. However, azido-based EMOFs always suffer low stabilities to external mechanical stimulation. Herein, we employed an in situ hydrothermal reaction as a technique to refine azide anions with a neutral triazole-cyano-based ligand TrzAt (TrzAt = 2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)acetonitrile) to yield two tetrazole-based EMOFs, namely, [ZnBr(trmetz)](n) 1 and [Cd(trmetz)(2)](n) 2 (Htrmetz = 5-(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1H-tetrazole). Compound 1 features a closely packed 2D layered network, while compound 2 exhibits a 3D architecture. With azide anions inlaid into a nitrogen-rich and chelating ligand in the EMOFs, compounds 1 and 2 present remarkable decomposition temperatures (T-dec >= 300 degrees C), low impact sensitivities (IS >= 32 J) and low friction sensitivities (FS >= 324 N). The calculated heat of detonation (Delta H-det) values of 1 and 2 are 3.496 and 4.112 kJ g(-1), respectively. In particular, the Delta H-det value of 2 is higher than that of traditional secondary explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT, Delta H-det = 3.720 kJ g(-1)). These results indicate that EMOFs 1 and 2 may serve as potential replacements for traditional secondary explosives. This work provides a simple and effective strategy to obtain two EMOFs with satisfactory energy densities and reliable stabilities through an in situ hydrothermal technique for desensitization of azide anions.",2023
Electrostatic interactions for directed assembly of high performance nanostructured energetic materials of Al/Fe,"Electrostatic self-assembly in organic solvent without intensively oxidative or corrosive environments, was adopted to prepare Al/Fe2O3/MWCNT nanostructured energetic materials as an energy generating material. The negatively charged MWCNT was used as a glue-like agent to direct the self-assembly of the well dispersed positively charged Al (fuel) and Fe2O3 (oxide) nanoparticles. This spontaneous assembly method without any surfactant chemistry or other chemical and biological moieties decreased the aggregation of the same nanoparticles largely, moreover, the poor interfacial contact between the Al (fuel) and Fe2O3 (oxide) nanoparticles was improved significantly, which was the key characteristic of high performance nanostructured energetic materials. In addition, the assembly process was confirmed as Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. The assembled Al/Fe2O3/MWCNT nanostructured energetic materials showed excellent performance with heat release of 2400 Jig, peak pressure of 0.42 MPa and pressurization rate of 105.71 MPa/s, superior to that in the control group Al/Fe2O3 nanostructured energetic materials prepared by sonication with heat release of 1326 J/g, peak pressure of 0.19 MPa and pressurization rate of 33.33 MPa/s. Therefore, the approach, which is facile, opens a promising route to the high performance nanostructured energetic materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016
"Multimillion-to-billion atom molecular dynamics simulations of deformation, damage, nanoindentation, and fracture in silica glass and energetic materials","Multimillion-to-billion molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to study atomistic mechanisms of deformation, damage and failure in silica glass and energetic materials. The simulations are based on experimentally validated interatomic potentials and employ highly efficiently algorithms for parallel architectures. The onset of void-void interaction is investigated by performing MD simulations of amorphous silica under hydrostatic tension. The simulations reveal that nanocavities in amorphous silica (a-SiO 2 ), which are linked to Si-O rings, play an important role in void-void coalescence and inter-void ligament failure. Nanocracks nucleated by the migration of three-fold coordinated Si and nonbridging O on —Si-O-Si-O— rings are observed in the multimillion MD simulations of a single void in amorphous silica subjected to a high shear rate. With the increase in shear strain, nanocracks appear on void surfaces and the voids deform into a threadlike structure. At a strain of 40%, the voids break into fragments. The results are similar to experimental and theoretical studies of bubble deformation and breakup under shear. Defects such as voids are known to be important in the detonation of energetic materials. To investigate deformation of a void in an RDX crystal under high shear rate, we have performed million-atom reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD simulations. Simulations reveal that without breaking a bond, the excess strain energy leads to translational and rotational motion of RDX molecules. At a strain of 13%, molecules with high kinetic energy collapse inward without affecting the rest of the system. MD simulations of nanoindentation in amorphous silica reveal migration of defects and their recombination in the densified plastic region under and the material pileup region around the indenter. The plastic flow of silica glass is related to the defect transport mechanism where a defect migrates a considerable distance via a chain of bond-switching events[44]. We obtained a hardness value of 7.2 GPa using a sharp indenter and 8.0 GPa for a slightly blunt indenter. We have also performed nanoindentation simulation on a (100) α-RDX crystal surface using ReaxFF. Simulation reveals localized melting and decomposition of RDX molecular fragments. We have found a distinct (210) plane boundary, where molecules above the (210) plane have displaced dramatically and molecules below the plane remain intact. Simulation also shows the fragmented RDX molecules diffuse from the substrate and walk on the indenter surface.",2008
Effect of Porosity on Dynamic Mechanical Properties and Impact Response Characteristics of High Aluminum Content PTFE/Al Energetic Materials,"In order to obtain the effect of porosity on the dynamic mechanical properties and impact response characteristics of high aluminum content PTFE/Al energetic materials, PTFE/Al specimens with porosities of 1.2%, 10%, 20%, and 30% were prepared by adding additives. The dynamic compression properties and impact response characteristics of high aluminum content PTFE/Al energetic materials with porosity were studied by using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) impact loading experimental system. Based on the one-dimensional viscoplastic hole collapse model, an impact temperature rise analysis model including melting effects was used, and corresponding calculation analysis was performed. The results show that with the increase of porosity, the yield strength and compressive strength of the material will decrease. Under dynamic loading, the reaction duration of PTFE/Al energetic materials with different porosities generally shows a tendency to become shorter as the porosity increases, while the ignition delay time is basically unchanged. In this experiment, the material response has the optimal porosity with the lowest critical strain rate, the optimal porosity for PTFE/Al energetic materials with different porosity and high aluminum content (50/50 mass ratio, size of specimens Phi 8 x 5 mm) is 10%. The research results can provide an important reference for the engineering application of PTFE/Al energetic materials.",2020
"Void collapse generated meso-scale energy localization in shocked energetic materials: Non-dimensional parameters, regimes, and criticality of hotspots","The formation of hotspots due to collapse of voids leads to enhanced sensitivity of heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials. Several mechanisms of void collapse have been identified, but the regimes in which these mechanisms dominate have not been clearly delineated using scaling arguments and dimensionless parameters. This paper examines void collapse in cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) to demarcate regimes where plastic collapse and hydrodynamic jetting play dominant roles in influencing hotspot related sensitivity. Using scaling arguments, a criticality envelope for HMX is derived in the form Sigma(cr) = Sigma (P-s, D-void), i.e., as a function of shock pressure P-s and void size D-void, which are controllable design parameters. Once a critical hotspot forms, its subsequent growth displays a complex relationship to P-s and D-void. These complexities are explained with scaling arguments that clarify the physical mechanisms that predominate in various regimes of hotspot formation. The insights and scaling laws obtained can be useful in the design of HE materials.",2019
The effects of crystal proximity and crystal-binder adhesion on the thermal responses of ultrasonically-excited composite energetic materials,"Composite energetic materials have been shown to generate heat under certain ultrasonic excitations, enough to drive rapid reactions in some cases. In an attempt to isolate the proposed heat generation mechanisms of frictional and viscoelastic heating at crystal-crystal and crystal-binder interfaces, a systematic study was conducted with cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine crystals arranged as discrete inclusions within Sylgard 184 binder. Groups of three embedded crystals, or ""triads,"" were arranged in two geometries with the crystals either in contact or slightly separated. Additionally, samples with good crystal-binder adhesion as well as ones mechanically debonded using compression were considered. The samples were excited ultrasonically with a contact piezoelectric transducer, and the top surface of each sample was monitored via infrared thermography. The contacting triads showed evidence of an intense localized heat source conducting to the polymer surface above the crystal locations in contrast to the separated triads. The debonded samples of both types reached higher maximum surface temperatures, on average. The results of both two-way and nested analysis of variance indicate a statistically significant difference for both adhesion and separation distance on temperature rise. We conclude that friction between crystal contact points and a debonded, moving binder at the crystal interface (also a mode of friction) play a significant role in localized heat generation, while viscoelastic/viscoplastic heating appears comparatively minor for these specific excitation conditions. The significance of frictional heat generation over viscoelastic heating in these systems may influence future design considerations related to the selection of binder materials for composite energetic materials.

Merger of Energetic Affinity and Optimal Geometry to Boost Hydrogen Storage in Porous Materials: Ab initio based Multiscale Simulations,"Hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel for various applications such as automobiles and portable devices because it is lightweight, abundant, and its oxidation product (water) is environmentally benign. However, its utilization is impeded by the lack of a safe and efficient storage device. Herein, we investigate and propose a new building block approach for an exhaustive search of optimal hydrogen uptakes in a series of low density boron nitride (BN) nanoarchitectures via an extensive 3868 multiscale simulations based on ab initio results. By probing various geometries, temperatures, pressures, and doping ratios, our results demonstrate a maximum uptake of 8.65 wt% at 300K, the highest hydrogen uptake on sorbents at room temperature without doping. Next, we investigate the Li+ doping of the nanoarchitectures exhibiting a set of optimal combinations of gravimetric and volumetric uptakes, surpassing the US DOE targets. Our findings suggest that the non-intuitive merger of energetic affinity and optimal geometry in BN building blocks overcomes the intrinsic limitations of sorbent materials, putting hybrid BN nanoarchitectures on equal footing with hydrides while demonstrating a superior capacity-kinetics-thermodynamics balance. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to improve the stability and accuracy of the fitting of empirical force- field parameters against ab initio data. Overall, the proposed building block approach, combined with the novel concepts and strategies for exhaustive search of optimum structure-property relationships in adsorption, opens up an entirely new phase space for making efficient high performance gas storage materials.",2016
"Sorption and desorption kinetics of nitroglycerin and 2,4-dinitrotoluene in nitrocellulose and implications for residue-bound energetic materials","Energetic materials (EMs) bound to propellant residues can contribute to environmental risk and public health concerns. This work investigated how nitrocellulose, a common binding material in propellants, may control the release dynamics of nitroglycerin (NG) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) from propellant residues. Batch adsorption/desorption experiments on nitrocellulose and re-interpretation on results from past leaching studies involving propellant-bound EMs were conducted. Mechanistic modeling of adsorption/desorption kinetics based on intra-particle diffusion (IPD) predicted aqueous intrinsic diffusivities (D-IW) to within a factor of 2 of expected values. Furthermore, the IPD model was able to predict effective diffusivities (D-ew) during the early leaching of NG from propellant residues to within a factor of 2 over a 3-log unit range. Prediction of leaching D-eff's associated with fired residues was less successful probably due to the neglect of compositional and morphological heterogeneity within the residues. Close correlations were found between the early and late D-effs of residue-bound NG and between the fast-and slow-domain rate constants for both EMs, suggesting that the late leaching kinetics of bound-EMs may be empirically assessed from the early kinetics. This work illustrates that, in addition to dissolution, retarded diffusion through nitrocellulose matrix may also limit the overall release and transformation of residue-bound EMs in the field. Implications and limitations of the current study, and the steps forward are also presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Trace analysis of energetic materials via direct analyte-probed nanoextraction coupled to direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry,"Direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) has proven to be a useful forensic tool for the trace analysis of energetic materials. While other techniques for detecting trace amounts of explosives involve extraction, derivatization, solvent exchange, or sample clean-up, DART-MS requires none of these. Typical DART-MS analyses directly from a solid sample or from a swab have been quite successful; however, these methods may not always be an optimal sampling technique in a forensic setting. For example, if the sample were only located in an area which included a latent fingerprint of interest, direct DART-MS analysis or the use of a swab would almost certainly destroy the print. To avoid ruining such potentially invaluable evidence, another method has been developed which will leave the fingerprint virtually untouched. Direct analyte-probed nanoextraction coupled to nanospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DAPNe-NSI-MS) has demonstrated excellent sensitivity and repeatability in forensic analyses of trace amounts of illicit drugs from various types of surfaces. This technique employs a nanomanipulator in conjunction with bright-field microscopy to extract single particles from a surface of interest and has provided a limit of detection of 300 attograms for caffeine. Combining DAPNe with DART-MS provides another level of flexibility in forensic analysis, and has proven to be a sufficient detection method for trinitrotoluene (TNT), RDX, and 1-methylaminoanthraquinone (MAAQ).

"Synthesis and Investigation of 2,3,5,6-Tetra-(1","The structures and properties of several energetic compounds based on a high-nitrogen-content anion, namely 2,3,5,6-tetra(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazine (H4TTP) are reported here for the first time. These energetic salts were synthesized by reacting H4TTP with various alkali metal hydroxides (sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium) and N-based (ammonia, hydrazine, hydroxylamine, guanidine carbonate, aminoguanidine bicarbonate). The resulting materials were comprehensively characterized by multinuclear (H-1, C-13) NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, DSC, as well as low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Heats of formation for the metal-free species as well as detonation parameters were calculated. The presented energetic materials (EMs) show high thermal stability (207 degrees C <= T-dec <= 300 degrees C), while the metal-free ionic derivatives exhibit desirable properties such as detonation velocity (6873 m s(-1)<= VC-J <= 8364 m s(-1)), detonation pressure (14.3 GPa <= p(C-J)<= 24.9 GPa), and specific impulse (141.4 <= I-sp <= 192.5 s).",2018
Electrochemical sensor for nitroaromatic type energetic materials using gold nanoparticles/poly(,"In this work, a novel electrochemical sensor was developed for the detection of nitroaromatic explosive materials, based on a gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode coated with poly(o-phenylenediamine-aniline film) (GC/P(o-PDA-co-ANI)-Au-nano electrode). Nitroaromatic compounds were detected through their pi-acceptor/donor interactions with o-phenylenediamine-aniline functionalities on the modified electrode surface. The enhanced sensitivities were achieved through pi-pi and charge-transfer (CT) interactions between the electron-deficient nitroaromatic compounds and sigma-/pi-donor amine/aniline groups linked to gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), providing increased binding and preconcentration onto the modified GC-electrodes. Selective determination of nitroaromatic type explosives in the presence of nitramines was enabled by o-PDA and reusability of the electrode achieved by Au-NPs. Calibration curves of current intensity versus concentration were linear in the range of 2.5-40 mg L-1 for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with a detection limit (LOD) of 2.1 mg L-1, 2-40 mg L-1 for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) (LOD=1.28 mg L-1), 5-100 mg L-1 for tetlyl (LOD=3.8 mg L-1) with the use of the GC/P(o-PDA-co-ANI)-AU(nano) electrode. For sensor measurements, coefficients of variation of intra- and inter-assay measurements were 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively (N=5), confirming the high reproducibility of the proposed assay. Deconvolution of current contributions of synthetic (TNT+DNT) mixtures at peak potentials of constituents was performed by multiple linear regression analysis to provide high sensitivity for the determination of each constituent. Determination options for all possible mixture combinations of nitroaromatic explosives are presented in this work. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the analysis of nitroaromatics in military explosives, namely comp B, octol, and tetrytol. Method validation was performed against GC-MS on real post-blast residual samples containing both explosives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
Ordered and layered structure of liquid nitromethane within a graphene bilayer: toward stabilization of energetic materials through nanoscale confinement,"The structural characteristics involving thermal stabilities of liquid nitromethane (NM)-one of the simplest energetic materials-confined within a graphene (GRA) bilayer were investigated by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. The results show that ordered and layered structures are formed at the confinement of the GRA bilayer induced by the van der Waals attractions of NM with GRA and the dipole-dipole interactions of NM, which is strongly dependent on the confinement size, i.e., the GRA bilayer distance. These unique intermolecular arrangements and preferred orientations of confined NM lead to higher stabilities than bulk NM revealed by bond dissociation energy calculations.",2015
A microactuator based on the decomposition of an energetic material for disposable lab-on-chip applications: fabrication and test,"A microactuator consisting of an inflatable elastic membrane based on the decomposition of a small mass of energetic material deposited on a silicon microstructured platform is presented for disposable lab-on-a-chip applications. The energetic-material-based actuator is characterized by its small size (< 0.25 mm(2) x 100 mu m), bio-compatibility and capability of generating sufficient overpressures (> 10 kPa) under low electrical power (< 100 mW) to eject a few nanolitres of fluid. This device has been fabricated using MEMS and microfluidic-compatible technology. The characterization of the actuation gave a pressurization of 13 kPa and a membrane deformation of 46 mu m for an electrical initial power of 90 mW (6.5 V, 13.9 mA). All these characteristics make such a microactuator well adapted for microfluidic applications and especially for the ejection of fluids contained in micro-channels of a disposable lab-on-a-chip.",2009
Determination of the combustion heat of several new energetic materials based on a small-mass combustion heat measurement device,"A device for determining the combustion heat of small mass for energetic materials (EMs) on the basis of 3D thermoelectric sensing technology was established.

The standard uncertainty of the test results ranges from 0.13% to 0.43%, indicating that the new combustion heat measurement device can be widely used to determine the combustion heats of small amounts of EMs.",
Accelerating the discovery of energetic melt-castable materials by a high-throughput virtual screening and experimental approach,"With the growth of chemical data, computation power and algorithms, machine learning-assisted high-throughput virtual screening (ML-assisted HTVS) is revolutionizing the research paradigm of new materials. Herein, a combined ML-assisted HTVS and experimental approach was applied to accelerate the search for energetic melt-castable materials with promising properties. The ML-assisted HTVS system is composed of high-throughput molecular generation (in a heuristic enumeration method) and five machine learning-based property prediction models (including density, melting point, decomposition temperature, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure). Using this system, we rapidly targeted 136 promising candidates from a generated molecular space containing 3892 molecules. With extensive efforts on experimental synthesis, eight new energetic melt-castable materials (MC-1 to MC-8) were obtained, and their measured properties were in good agreement with the predicted results. This work verifies the effectiveness of the combined ML-assisted HTVS and experimental approach for the accelerated discovery of energetic melt-castable materials.",2021
Near-surface bipartition model for the study of material response of plasma-facing surfaces exposed to energetic charged particles,"In order to predict the erosion rates and lifetimes of candidate plasma facing component (PFC) materials, the sputtering yields of Mo, W and deuterium-saturated Li surfaces bombarded by energetic charged particles were calculated by a new near-surface analytical sputtering model based on a bipartition model of charge particle transport theory. Lithium was considered as an alternative material providing low-recycling regime operation in advanced tokamak devices; expected charged-particle energies range from 100-1000eV. Comparisons were made with Monte Carlo calculations of the TRIM code and experimental results, where available. The maximum sputtering yield of W by 3 keV He+ ions, for example, was 0.032 and for Li by 0.4 keV He+ ions was 0.17. Also calculated were the dependencies of maximum energy deposition and particle and energy reflection coefficients on the incident energy of energetic runaway electrons impinging on different material surfaces. The results are particularly important for estimating the lifetime of PFCs and analyzing the extent of impurity contamination, especially for high-power density and with a high plasma current fusion reactor.

Molecular dynamic simulation of performance of modified BAMO/AMMO copolymers and their effects on mechanical properties of energetic materials,"Based on molecular dynamic method, densities, mechanical behavior and mechanical performance of P(BAMO/ AMMO) (Polymer 1) and two novel modified P(BAMO/AMMO) (Polymer 2: containing amino group, Polymer 3: containing nitro group), and their effects on mechanical properties of four energetic materials are investigated, the main results are as follow: Polymer 2 (1.235 g/cm(3), 240 +/- 5 K) and Polymer 3: 1.281 g/cm(3), 181 +/- 3 K) possess higher densities and lower glass transition temperatures than Polymer 1 (1.229 g/cm(3), 247 +/- 4 K). The modification makes Polymer 1 difficult to expand, improves its mechanical properties, but has few effect on its diffusion coefficient at same temperature and state. In addition, three binders are compatible with TNT, HMX and CL-20, and may react with DNTF. All polymers particularly improve rigidity of four energetic materials, and enhance their ductility except Polymer 2 on TNT. The ability of Polymer 2 and Polymer 3 improving rigidity (except Polymer 3 on HMX) and ductility of TNT and HMX is inferior to that of Polymer 1, but it is contrary for CL-20 and DNTF (except Polymer 2 on rigidity of DNTF). Moreover, Polymer 2-based interfacial crystals exhibit higher rigidity than Polymer 3-based interfacial crystals.",2020

The salts have characterized through elemental analysis, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy, (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13 and mass spectrometry. The crystal structures determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal decomposition behaviors investigated by using the DSC and TG-DTG technologies. The enthalpies of formation are calculated through the combustion heat data measured through the oxygen bomb calorimetry. All the salts have acceptable thermal stability with the highest decomposition temperature of 301.8 degrees C, excellent high positive formation enthalpies ranging from 350.5 kJ mol(-1) to 1500.3 kJ mol(-1), and good insensitivity to outer stimuli compared to the traditional RDX. The promising detonation parameters of the salts yield detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) are ranging from 7327 m s(-1) to 8931 m s(-1), and from 21.7GPa to 32.7 GPa.

"Pressure-induced hydrogen bonds reconstruction of energetic material 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine: A DFT study","Pressure-induced changes in molecular structure can result in the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. The structure and vibrational properties of hydrogen-bonded material 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine were calculated to 50 GPa. When compression, the compressibility displays anisotropy. At 37 GPa, the N-H length increases abruptly to 1.51 angstrom, suggesting that N-H has broken. The discontinuous changes indicate that 37 GPa is a critical point for structural changes. The hydrogen bond network becomes strengthened, resulting in a decrease in the vibrational activity of NH/NH2. At 37 GPa, the direction of NH correlated vibration modes change. In Hirshfeld analysis, the strengthening of N...H interactions was confirmed.",2023
Transferability of electronic structure of four energetic materials by using single crystal and high resolution X -ray diffraction experiments,"The electronic structures of four energetic materials, trinitrodiazapentalene (C 6 H 3 N 5 O 6 , TNDAP), β-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (C 4 H 8 N 8 O 8 , β-HMX), 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (C 3 H 4 N 4 O 6 , TNAZ), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-s-triazine (C 3 H 6 N 6 O 6 , RDX), have been analyzed using Hansen-Coppens multipole refinements, using high resolution X-ray diffraction data collected at low temperature, as well as from theoretical calculated structure factors from the solid state phase using density functional theory (DFT), plus B3LYP level theory, and the 6-31G* basis set. However, when comparing both the deformation density and the electrostatic potentials from the theoretical results in TNDAP and TNAZ, they disagree with the experimental results. Therefore, those results have been deposited in appendices A4 and A6, for future reference. In HMX and RDX the theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental results. The physical properties derived from the electronic structure in these four energetic materials, such as multipole populations, the values of the electron density and its Laplacian of the electron density at the bond critical points, have also been calculated using “Atoms in Molecules” (AIM) theory both from the solid state phase calculation, and the experiment, as well as directly calculated from the free molecule in the gas phase. The electron density and the magnitude of its Laplacian from the gas phase are always larger than for the solid state phase calculation and the experiment. This may be due to the packing effect. The transferability of the experimental electronic structure of the NO 2 groups from HMX to TNDAP, TNAZ and RDX are also presented here. Even though the major populated multipoles are robust (small e.s.d.'s), these are few in number, compared with other lower populated multipoles for which the populations span a larger range. Since the deformation electron density distributions are reconstructed using linear combinations of the multipoles, it is necessary to give more degrees of freedom in the refinements. Therefore, those electron density distributions which have a wider range of the multipole populations should not be fixed in the refinements. Utilizing the same coordinate system setup in the multipole refinements of the functional groups, this system can be used as a starting point for solving the charge distribution of a larger system.",2004
Inference of chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties from constant-volume combustion of materials,"Constant-volume combustion tests have been widely used to characterize the reactivity, the combustion efficiency, and the gas-generating performance of energetic materials. However, the currently used perfor-mance metrics (ignition delay time, pressurization rate, and maximum pressure) highly rely on the specific experimental condition, which leads to the challenge of fairly comparing the material performance tested in different conditions and laboratories. For this reason, there has been a need for a new metric independent of the experimental conditions, along with a novel analytical tool. In this work, we proposed a kinetic modeling framework to infer the chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties from the pressure profiles in constant-volume combustion tests. In this framework, a physical model predicts the thermodynamic states of the system during the constant-volume combustion process, while an inverse model calibrates the model parameters to fit the model to the experimental observation via sensitivity analysis. We demonstrated the success of the framework in inferring the chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties with both synthesized data and experimental measurements. Moreover, the physical model with the inferred properties enabled a comprehensive understanding of how gas release and temperature rise contribute to the pressure rise in the constant-volume reactor. Therefore, the classical constant-volume combustion experiments can be utilized to infer properties for the design of energetic materials with desired gas and heat generation profiles and for modeling the energetic behaviors in more complex systems.",2023
Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analyses of the Nonlinear Behavior of Heterogeneous Material Microstructures: Applications to Dynamic Response of Energetic Materials and Cyclic Response of a Titanium Alloy,"This dissertation is concerned with understanding the uncertainty and variability in the failure and nonlinear response of materials with heterogeneous microstructures at fine scales (i.e., micrometers to millimeters). In the microscale simulations with uncertainty in the complex morphologies and material behaviors, characterization of the relative roles of the competing and interacting deformation and failure mechanisms is achieved by the proposed uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis frameworks. Two separate material systems subjected to two different loading conditions are investigated. In the first case, the dynamic response of energetic materials in the form of particulate crystals embedded in a polymer matrix and in polycrystalline form are investigated. In the second case, the probabilistic characterization of nucleation of microcracks in a titanium alloy subjected to cyclic loading is performed. This dissertation particularly focuses on the identification of the critical microstructural mechanisms and parameters that lead to the onset of failure at this scale.",2021
Nitrogen-rich salts based on polyamino substituted ,"A new family of nitrogen-rich energetic salts based on 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azo-1,2,4-triazole containing an N,N'-azo linkage has been synthesized and fully characterized by IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectrum, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and sensitivities toward impact, friction and electrostatics. The crystal structures of chloride 2, nitrate 3, perchlorate 4 and isomerization product 10 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All the salts exhibit high thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures of over 200 degrees C, except for nitroformate 6. The measured densities of salts 2-7 fall in the range of 1.71 to 1.99 g cm(-1). Theoretical performance calculations (Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5) provided detonation pressures and velocities for energetic salts in the ranges 26.3 to 45.7 GPa and 8042 to 9580 m s (1) , respectively. Moreover, these salts exhibit reasonable impact sensitivities (IS = 8-40 J) and friction sensitivities (FS 90-360 N); these salts also exhibit excellent thermal stabilities, high detonation properties and reasonable sensitivities, which, in some cases, are superior to those of TNT, TATB and HMX, and present a favorable balance between the energy and stability of energetic materials. In addition, these salts exhibit excellent specific impulses (265 to 301 s), which make them competitive energetic materials.",2014
 Genotoxicity Prediction by Similarity Search and Machine Learning Algorithm: Optimization and Validation of the Method for High Energetic Materials,"The European regulation REACh (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals) has placed responsibility on the industry to manage the risk from chemicals since 2006. In order to ensure a high level of protection of human health and environment, toxicity prediction methods are now a widely used tool for regulatory decision making and selection of leads in new substances design. These in silico methods are an alternative to traditional in vitro and in vivo testing methods, which are laborious, time-consuming, highly expensive, and even involve animal welfare issues. Many computational methods have been employed to predict the toxicity profile of substances, but they are mostly adapted to pharmaceutical molecules and not to High Energetic Materials (HEMs).In line with these restrictions, ArianeGroup set up a collaborative project with the French CNRS to develop optimized tools for the prediction of HEM properties, such as genotoxicity. Several in silico methods can be used to predict the properties of molecules, such as QSAR, Local QSAR or Machine Learning. We already demonstrated that using Local QSAR allows for better predictions with a good reliability [1].We therefore developed a genotoxicity prediction tool based on the structural similarity search coupled with a supervised machine learning algorithm. This tool is composed of 3 predictive models: the Ames test, the Chromosomal Aberration test and the Mouse Lymphoma Assay. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of these models to predict the genotoxicity of HEMs. We also present the methodology we applied to build these models and to optimize their performances. The dimensional reduction of the training set and the hyperparameters tuning of the different algorithms showed a performance acceleration and a significant reduction of the overfitting, which caused a decline in the generalization capacity of the predictive models. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated on a test set of HEMs and compared to the results of other prediction softwares.",2023
Oil-in-water nanoemulsion adhesive system: Preparation by ultrasonic homogenization and its application in 3D direct writing composite energetic materials,"Stable and low-particle size nanoemulsions were prepared using ultrasound homogenization. The conditions for preparing low-viscosity nanoemulsions were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) experimental design. The results showed that the addition of composite surfactants at 1%, an ultrasound amplitude of 35%, an ultrasound time of 4 min, and an ultrasound temperature of 20 degrees C yielded nanoemulsions with the best particle size and stability. The particle distribution was uniform, and the cold and heat stability were good. Compared with traditional emulsions, the low-viscosity nanoemulsion had better environmental stability, storage stability, and exhibited a phenomenon of self-reducing particle size at 40-55 degrees C, indicating that the emulsion had good performance under complex environmental conditions. The performance test of composite energetic materials using two types of emulsions as bonding systems showed that the low-viscosity nanoemulsion composite energetic material effectively reduced friction sensitivity, increased detonation velocity, and had better thermal stability and smaller propagation size. The results confirmed that the low-viscosity nanoemulsion perfectly met the requirements of bonding agents for composite energetic materials. This study provides a new approach for bonding agent systems of composite energetic materials and can serve as a new method to meet the special requirements of composite energetic materials.",2024
"4,4′-Dinitrimino-5,5′-diamino-3,3′-azo-bis-1,2,4-triazole: A High-Performing Zwitterionic Energetic Material","Mixed acid nitration of electrochemically generated 4,4',5,5'-tetraamino-3,3'-azo-bis-1,2,4-triazole (TAABT) generated the novel energetic material 4,4'-dinitrimino-5,5'-diamino-3,3'-azo-bis-1,2,4-triazole (DNDAABT). Various energetic salts of DNDAABT were also prepared and characterized to confirm their structures and determine their explosive sensitivities and performances. The free acid of DNDAABT exists as a zwitterionic molecule that leads to a high-density material with predicted detonation parameters comparable to those of TKX-50 (bis(hydroxylammonium) 5,5'-bis(tetrazolate-1 N-oxide). Due to the insensitive nature of TAABT, it was predicted that DNDAABT would demonstrate remarkably low sensitivities for a primary N-nitramine. However, it was found that DNDAABT and all salts produced have primary explosive sensitivities, albeit with relatively high thermal stabilities for primary N-nitramines.",2021
Energetic and exergetic analysis of a sloped solar still integrated with a separated heat storage system incorporating phase change material,"A single slope solar still coupled with a separated heat storage system consisting of a double glazing solar collector provided with latent heat storage material(PCM) is investigated in this paper. This system is moulded for working autonomously and continuously throughout the day. A transient model is developed for assessing the performances of this device under summer climatic conditions of the Algerian Sahara. In this model, the fraction of molten PCM was assessed at each time step, which allowed inspecting the evolution of PCM material during all the time of computations. The results indicate that the additional heat storage system supplied heat to the still for 20 h continuously during the daytime. Accordingly, it is found that the increase rates of daily and nocturnal yields were respectively 63% and 635% (an increase of more than six times) compared to the conventional system. Furthermore, it is exhibited that the useful energy is strongly influenced by the increase of PCM mass, so this parameter must be lowered as possible. Also, it is shown that in the summer season; there is an optimum tilt angle of 15. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that a great part of the irreversibility generated in the system is caused by the solar radiation and the PCM irreversibility represents only 7% of the total irreversibility. It is also revealed that the daily irreversibility decreases slightly with increasing the water mass and collector slope angle, but possesses an optimum at a PCM thickness of 6 cm.",2021
"Pushing the limits of energetic materials - the synthesis and characterization of dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate","The safe preparation and characterization (XRD, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, DSC, mass spectrometry, sensitivities) of a new explosive dihydroxylammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) that outperforms all other commonly used explosive materials is detailed. While much publicized high-performing explosives, such as octanitrocubane and CL-20, have been at the forefront of public awareness, this compound differs in that it is simple and cheap to prepare from commonly available chemicals. TKX-50 expands upon the newly exploited field of tetrazole oxide chemistry to produce a material that not only is easily prepared and exceedingly powerful, but also possesses the required thermal insensitivity, low toxicity, and safety of handling to replace the most commonly used military explosive, RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane). In addition, the crystal structures of the intermediates 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diol dihydrate, 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diol dimethanolate and dimethylammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate were determined and presented.",2012
A General Model of Impact Sensitivity for Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Materials: A Combined Incremental Theory and Genetic Function Approximation Study,"In this paper, we report the first example of impact sensitivity prediction based on the genetic function approximation (GFA) as a regression method. The prediction is applicable for a wide variety of chemical families, which include nitro compounds, peroxides, nitrogen-rich salts, heterocycles, etc. Within this work, we have obtained 7 empirical models (with 27-32 basis functions), which all provide 0.80 <= R2 <= 0.83 and 7.2 J <= RMSE <= 7.8 J (for 450 training set compounds) and 0.64 <= R2 <= 0.70 and 11.2 J <= RMSE <= 12.4 J (for 170 test set compounds). The models were developed using Friedman Lack-of-Fit as a scoring function, which allows avoiding an overfitting. All the models have simple descriptors as basis functions and include linear splines. Furthermore, the applied descriptors do not require expensive calculation procedures, namely, non-empirical quantum-chemical calculations, complex iterative procedures, real space electron density analysis, etc. Most descriptors are based on structural and topological analysis and a part of them require very cheap semi-empirical PM6 calculations. The prediction takes a few minutes as an average, and most of the time is for the structure preparation and manual calculation of the descriptor ""Increment"", which is based on our recent incremental theory. In this work, we report the first attempt of the development of a universal method for impact sensitivity prediction extrapolated to trending energetic materials - nitrogen-rich compounds. A simple two-step methodology including both manual and machine calculation usually takes a few minutes to provide this paramount-importance property with an acceptable accuracy. image",2024
"New Role for an N,N′-Alkylidene Bridge: Taming the Hygroscopicity of Acidic Energetic Materials with Enhanced Stability","Hygroscopicity can cause undesirable chemical reactions, affect the stability and compatibility, and also the reduce strength and detonation performance of energetic materials; therefore, it should be avoided for civil and military applications. The existence of acidic protons in the molecule is the main causes of hygroscopicity, and the most common strategy to eliminate acidic hydrogen includes the formation of salts, introduction of N-CH3 or N-NH2 groups, etc. In this work, we present the preparation of tricyclic fused-ring energetic compounds derived from bi(1,2,3-triazole) by introducing an N,N'-alkylidene bridge which could act as a ""buffer"" to reduce the external stimuli, therefore resulting in compounds with enhanced thermal stability and reduced sensitivity as well as elimination of the hygroscopicity and acidity in the meantime. Their physical and chemical properties were determined and interpreted by both experimental and theoretical methods. The nonhygroscopicity, good thermal stability (C1, T-d = 277 degrees C; C2, T-d = 290 degrees C), low sensitivity (C1, IS = 30 J, FS > 360 N; C2, IS = 50 J, FS > 360 N), and detonation properties (C1, D = 8287 m s(-1); P = 29.4 GPa; C2, D = 8027 m s(-1); P = 25.4 GPa) comparable to those of TATB (D = 8114 m s(-1); P = 31.2 GPa) make them desirable candidates as high-energy insensitive energetic materials.",2022
Exchanging of NH,"Two series of fused-ring energetic materials containing NH2 (Amino)/NHNH2 (Diazanyl)/NHOH (Hydrox-ylamino) groups were successfully synthesized and fully characterized. The thermal properties of all newly synthesized energetic compounds were measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The heat of formation and detonation properties were obtained using the Gaussian 09 and EXPLO5 v6.06.02 programs, respectively. Among them, diazanyl-based compound 10 and hydroxylamino-based compound 11 exhibit excellent density (p >= 1.86 g.cm(-3), good thermal stability (T-d >= 202.0 degrees C), excellent calculated detonation performance (Dv >= 8830 m.s(-1), P >= 29.8 GPa) and good sensitivities (IS >= 25 J, FS > 360 N), whose values are comparable to those of RDX. Thus, they have significant potential for application as secondary explosives. In addition, the relationships between the substituents (Amino, Diazanyl, Hydroxylamino) and sensitivities were investigated using Hirschfeld surfaces, 2D fingerprint plots, and electrostatic potential. Results demonstrate that amino group plays an important role in the good thermal stability and insensitive of energetic materials. However, substituting amino groups with diazanyl or hydroxylamino groups can significantly improve the detonation properties of fused-ring energetic materials. These findings provide a reference for the development of the next-generation of advanced fused-ring energetic materials.",2023
"1,2,3-Triazole with linear and branched catenated nitrogen chains - The role of regiochemistry in energetic materials","Two energetic molecules possessing a linear and branched N8 structure were synthesized based on the oxidative coupling of N-aminotriazoles. Despite the same chemical formula and azo functionality, the decomposition temperatures (T-d) of these two regioisomers reflect a gap of more than 80 degrees C. Based on the data of single crystal X-ray diffraction, comparative investigation associated with the bond length and stacking pattern rationalize the different properties of density and molecular stability. Theoretical analyses, e.g., charge distribution and Hirshfeld surface, were carried out subsequently to gain more insight into the regiochemistry of catenated nitrogen-atom chains. The difference of charge distribution between two molecules caused by regional heterogeneity is the main reason for their different stabilities.",2021
"Computational studies on novel energetic materials: (E)-2,4,6-Trinitro-N-(2,4,6-trinitrobenzylidene) benzenamine and its isomers",Some novel energetic isomeric materials have been designed substituting three nitro groups on each aromatic ring at different positions of N-benzylidenebenzamine. Structure-1 differs from HNS by having an aza-substitution (centric perturbation) at the olefin carbon. The other structures are constitutional isomers of I. By using DFT [B3LYP/6-31 G(d)] approach various MO and ballistics properties of these structures have been calculated and compared with values of HNS and HNAB which are related to 1.,2010
Linking a farm model and a location optimization model for evaluating energetic and material straw valorization pathways-A case study in Baden-Wuerttemberg,"Diminishing fossil carbon resources, global warming, and increasing material and energy needs urge for the rapid development of a bioeconomy. Biomass feedstock from agro-industrial value chains provides opportunities for energy and material production, potentially leading to competition with traditional food and feed production. Simulation and optimization models can support the evaluation of biomass value chains and identify bioeconomy development paths, potentials, opportunities, and risks. This study presents the linkage of a farm model (EFEM) and a techno-economic location optimization model (BIOLOCATE) for evaluating the straw-to-energy and the innovative straw-to-chemical value chains in the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg taking into account the spatially distributed and price-sensitive nature of straw supply. The general results reveal the basic trade-off between economies of scale of the energy production plants and the biorefineries on the one hand and the feedstock supply costs on the other hand. The results of the farm model highlight the competition for land between traditional agricultural biomass utilization such as food and feed and innovative biomass-to-energy and biomass-to-chemical value chains. Additionally, farm-modeling scenarios illustrate the effect of farm specialization and regional differences on straw supply for biomass value chains as well as the effect of high straw prices on crop choices. The technological modeling results show that straw combustion could cover approximately 2% of Baden-Wuerttemberg's gross electricity consumption and approximately 35% of the district heating consumption. The lignocellulose biorefinery location and size are affected by the price sensitivity of the straw supply and are only profitable for high output prices of organosolv lignin. The location optimization results illustrate that economic and political framework conditions affect the regional distribution of biomass straw conversion plants, thus favoring decentralized value chain structures in contrast to technological economies of scale.",2019
Regioisomeric N-C functionalization of an asymmetric N-rich framework: a promising pathway to heat-resistant energetic materials,"Energetic materials with high decomposition temperatures have wide applications in extreme environments such as spacecraft separation systems and drilling engineering. In this study, regioisomeric N-functionalization of an asymmetric pyrazole-triazole backbone yielded a highly thermostable energetic compound, 1-methyl-3-(1-methyl-3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-5-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole (4), alongside a trace amount of its regioisomer, 1-methyl-5-(1-methyl-4,5-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole (5). The structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. At a decomposition temperature of 337 ?, compound 4 competes effectively with its isomer 5 (T-d, 189 ?) and with other reported N-methyl functionalized nitrogen-rich azoles. Additionally, its low sensitivity to impact and friction adds value as a heat-resistant energetic compound. Compared to analogous N-C functionalized bisazoles I (T-d = 275 ?) and Me2TNBI (T-d = 258 ?), the thermal behaviors of 4 and 5 highlight the synergistic effect of the asymmetric backbone and regioisomeric N-C functionalization on designing heat-resistant energetic materials.",2023
Laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM): a novel microscale technique for characterizing energy release at high heating rates,"In this review we detail the expansion of laser-induced shock waves into the air following nanosecond-pulsed laser ablation of energetic materials for comparison of the microsecond-timescale energy release among different samples; subsequent self-sustained combustion reactions provide information about the millisecond-timescale energy release. This technique is called laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM). A detailed description of the processes involved in LASEM is presented, along with the experimental conditions for successfully differentiating similar energetic materials. The influence of material properties and sample preparation, laser properties, high-speed imaging parameters, and data fitting methodology on the characteristic laser-induced shock velocities is reviewed with relevant examples. Related work by other groups is also discussed, demonstrating the increasing usage of laser-induced plasmas and their subsequent effects for energetic material characterization on a laboratory scale. We provide examples of recent capability upgrades. Finally, we enumerate the open questions relating to LASEM experimental results and their relationship to detonation chemistry.",
Direct detonation initiation with thermal deposition due to pore collapse in energetic materials - towards the coupling between micro- and macroscale,"In this work we investigate the initiation of detonations in energetic materials through thermal power deposition due to pore collapse. We solve the reactive Euler equations, with the energy equation augmented by a power deposition term. The deposition term is partially based on previous results of simulations of pore collapse at the microscale, modelled at the macroscale as hotspots. It is found that a critical size of the hotspots exists. If the hotspots exceed the critical size, direct initiation of detonation can be achieved even with a low power input, in contrast to the common assumption that a sufficient power is necessary to initiate detonation. We show that sufficient power is necessary only when the size of the hotspots is below the critical size. In this scenario, the so-called explosion in the explosion', the initial ignition does not lead to a detonation directly, but detonation occurs later as a result of shock-to-detonation transition in the region processed by the shock wave generated by the initial ignition.",2017
Reactive Bonding with Integrated Reactive and Nano Scale Energetic Material Systems (iRMS): State-of-the-Art and Future Development Trends,This paper introduces different principles and deposition methods that use a specific form of local heat generation.

The resulting heat can be used as heat source for bonding processes.,2014
Development of T -jump /Raman spectroscopy as a complement to T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy for the pyrolysis of energetic materials,"In the attempt to understand various combustion issues, several methods have previously been used to generate combustion-like simulations for energetic materials. Low heating rate and temperature experiments have been conducted using DSC and TGA. Information obtained was useful but could not be extrapolated into combustion processes. However controlled higher heating rate experiments using FTIR detection have provided further insight into the mechanism of decomposition by analyzing evolution of gaseous products. As only IR-active species were detected, the stoichiometry of the decomposition reaction could only partially be determined. The decomposition equation was computed by assuming that O 2 , H 2 , and N 2 made up the difference in the atom balance. Advances made in this dissertation, namely the development of T-jump/Raman spectroscopy, eliminated the need to assume the concentrations of IR-inactive products. T-Jump/Raman spectroscopy, like its complement T-jump/FTIR spectroscopy, utilizes a controlled, high heating rate to pyrolyze energetic materials. The method was validated using a variety of test materials: cured mixtures of BTTN/GAP/RDX, nitrate esters, and 5-substituted 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydropyrimidines. In all of these studies, the discrepancies in the elemental atom balances were usually within 5%. Insight was gained into the overall decomposition mechanism of these compounds and mixtures. In the cured mixture study, the use of the curing agent HMDI was found to produce a propellant which tended to burn more cleanly than a mixture cured with N-100. The investigation of the aliphatic nitrate esters showed a strong correlation between the oxygen balance and the composition of the gaseous pyrolysis products. However, a study on a group of 5-substituted 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydropyrimidines demonstrated that the thermal decomposition was more affected by the substituent on the 5 position than the oxygen balance. The identity of the substituent seemed to trigger the decomposition, as indicated both by the temperature and gaseous products.",2003
"Smart Host-Guest Energetic Material Constructed by Stabilizing Energetic Fuel Hydroxylamine in Lattice Cavity of 2,4,6,8,10,12-Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane Significantly Enhanced the Detonation, Safety, Propulsion, and Combustion Performances","The host-guest inclusion strategy has become a promising method for developing novel high-energy density materials (HEDMs). The selection of functional guest molecules was a strategic project, as it can not only enhance the detonation performance of host explosives but can also modify some of their suboptimal performances. Here, to improve the propulsion and combustion performances of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW), a novel energetic-energetic host-guest inclusion explosive was obtained by incorporating energetic rocket fuel, hydroxylamine (HA), into the lattice cavities of HNIW. Based on their perfect space matching, the crystallographic density of HNIW-HA was determined to be 2.00 g/cm(3) at 296 K, which has reached the gold standard regarding the density of HEDMs. HNIW-HA also showed higher thermal stability (T-d = 245.9 degrees C) and safety (H-50 = 16.8 cm) and superior detonation velocity (DV = 9674 m/s) than the epsilon-HNIW. Additionally, because of the excellent combustion performance of HA, HNIW-HA possessed higher propulsion performances, including combustion speed (S-C = 39.5 mg/s), combustion heat (Q(C) = 8661 J/g), and specific impulse (I-sp = 276.4 s), than epsilon-HNIW. Thus, the host-guest inclusion strategy has potential to surpass the limitations of energy density and suboptimal performances of single explosives and become a strategy for developing multipurpose intermolecular explosives.",2021
"Novel high performance energetic materials of fluorine-containing 2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol derivatives with substituted azoles","Azoles such as tetrazole, triazole, pyrazole, and imidazole are considered to be core nitrogen rich structures. 2,6-Dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol was treated with imidazole, 3-nitropyrazole, 1,2,4-triazole, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole, 5-aminotetrazole, and 5-nitrotriazolone to synthesize acid-base salts using a proton transfer mechanism. The spectroscopic characterization of the synthesized compounds 1-7 was carried out by IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and F-19 NMR spectroscopies. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of compounds 1 and 3 showed that they possess densities of 1.675 and 1.670 g/cm(3), respectively. The detonation properties of all the synthesized compounds were studied using computational software such as the LOTUSES, EXPLO 5, and EXTEC codes. The blast peak over pressure and blast impulse were determined for each compound. The thermal behaviour of the synthesized compounds was analyzed using TGA/DSC thermogram, and each compound was found to exhibit acceptable thermal stability. The performance of the synthesized compounds were found to be high and fit into the category of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs).",2021
Assembly of Tetrazolylfuroxan Organic Salts: Multipurpose Green Energetic Materials with High Enthalpies of Formation and Excellent Detonation Performance,"A series of highly energetic organic salts comprising a tetrazolylfuroxan anion, explosophoric azido or azo functionalities, and nitrogen-rich cations were synthesized by simple, efficient, and scalable chemical routes. These energetic materials were fully characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13, N-14, N-15) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Additionally, the structure of an energetic salt consisting of an azidotetrazolylfuroxan anion and a 3,6,7-triamino-7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazolium cation was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.57-1.71 g cm(-3)), very high enthalpies of formation (818-1363 kJ mol(-1)), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.54-8.26 kms(-1) and detonation pressures 23.4-29.3 GPa). Most of the synthesized energetic salts have moderate sensitivity toward impact and friction, which makes them promising candidates for a variety of energetic applications. At the same time, three compounds have impact sensitivity on the primary explosives level (1.5-2.7 J). These results along with high detonation parameters and high nitrogen contents (66.0-70.2 %) indicate that these three compounds may serve as potential environmentally friendly alternatives to lead-based primary explosives.",2019
Nitrogen-rich 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole-2-acetic acid and its alkaline earth metal coordination polymers for potential energetic materials,"Tetrazole and its derivatives with rich nitrogen atoms may be potential candidates for energetic materials. Alkaline earth metal coordination compounds based on such ligands are relatively less investigated. Hpytza was prepared from 4-cyanopyridine and sodium azide, ethyl bromoacetate, where Hpytza = 5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazole-2-acetic acid. Hpytza and four alkaline earth metal coordination polymers [Mg (pytza)(2)](n) (1),[Ca(pytza)(2)(H2O)(2)](n)center dot 3nH(2)O (2), [Sr(pytza)(2)(H2O)(2)](n) (3) and [Ba(pytza)(2)(H2O)(2)](n)center dot nH(2)O (4) were prepared under solvothermal conditions. The thermal behavior of these compounds were characterized by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) analyses. Furthermore, the critical temperature of thermal explosion and relevant thermal parameters Delta S, Delta H, Delta G of Hpytza and polymers 1-4 were calculated, as well, indicating that these compounds are potential energetic materials.

Crystal engineering with energetic picric acid halogen-based salts: Promising properties of a new family of insensitive materials,"Newly designed 1:1 energetic salts formed by pairing the picric acid with 3-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, 3-bromoaniline, and 4-iodoaniline were achieved by the solvent evaporation method. The structures of the target salts were then determined and characterized according to single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques, infrared spectroscopy, and thermal analyses (DSC and TGA). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction results revealed that the salts are mainly formed through host-guest (anions-cations) with the aid of inter-molecular hydrogen bond (N-H center dot center dot center dot O, C-H center dot center dot center dot O) and halogen bond (C-Br center dot center dot center dot O, C-I center dot center dot center dot O). The enthalpies of formation, the optimized structures, total energies, and frontier orbital energies of each compound were calculated using Gaussian 09, whereas the detonation performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 software package. Using the BAM fall hammer instrument, it was determined that the salts were less impact sensitive than picric acid. This significant difference in impact sensitivities of salts may arise from considerably halogen-bonded and hydrogen-bonded interactions, packing coefficient, oxygen-oxygen (O center dot center dot center dot O) interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and electrostatic potential surface properties. These findings might be exploited to build novel crystallization techniques based on energetic halogen compounds. Thus, the novel four energetic salts exhibit an appealing combination of high energy and low sensitivity and therefore may be exploited as a potential insensitive biocidal material option in the future in place of picric acid in low vulnerability formulations.

Imino-bridged N-rich energetic materials: C,"This study reports the synthesis of a series of novel imino-bridged N-rich energetic compounds, namely C4H3N17 (N%: 82.4) and their derivatives, which were formed by four tetrazole (CN4) moieties. C4N173- could be acidified by different concentrations of HCl and N-rich anions such as C4H2N17- and the neutral compound 3 (C4H3N17) could be obtained. The new compounds all exhibit good energetic performance (D: 8023-9668 m s(-1); Td: 169-277 degrees C; IS > 25 J; FS > 252 N). Remarkably, the ammonia oxide adduct compound 8 (C4H15N21O4) was exceedingly powerful (D: 9668 m s(-1)) similar to CL-20 (9706 m s(-1)) and showed good stability (Td: 168 degrees C; IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N). Moreover, compound 11 (C4H8NaN19) exhibits not only the thermal stability and high density of metallic salts but also the mechanical stability of nonmetallic salts, which provides an important strategy for the design and synthesis of energetic materials. Among them, compounds 3, 4, and 6-11 were characterized via single-crystal diffraction to further confirm their exact molecular structure and arrangement.",2021
Research on propellant components: I. Vibrational spectroscopy correlations in energetic materials. II. Aging studies of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene based binder,"This dissertation consists of two research projects dealing with the chemistry of rocket propellant components. The first project is an investigation of the vibrational spectroscopy of fifty-nine energetic nitro and nitramino compounds. The geometries were optimized and the vibrational frequencies were calculated using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31+G*). Detailed descriptions of the molecular motions were assigned to the observed infrared spectra. Trends in the vibrational modes of the nitro group were sought. A previously unreported correlation was found between the nitro group internal bonding angle and its asymmetric stretching frequency. The concept of meta and ortho/para directing groups was found to apply to trends in coupled motions in the nitroaromatic compounds. The second project concerns the aging of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based solid rocket propellant. One-dimensional aging profiles were developed at temperatures low enough to be considered actual storage temperatures. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to follow chemical changes in the HTPB binder associated with aging. Success was marginal, but the first evidence of the peroxyl group was obtained. Extraction of the soluble fraction of the binder enabled profiles to be developed based on crosslinking. A new concept of in situ oxygen sensors was used to investigate diffusion of O 2 into the propellant. Results for samples aged at two temperatures led to the hypothesis that increased concentrations of dissolved O 2 at lower temperatures lead to increased reaction rates of aging at higher temperatures. This finding has potentially important ramifications for storage of propellant and how aging studies are interpreted.",2004
Exploring Cuneanes as Potential Benzene Isosteres and Energetic Materials: Scope and Mechanistic Investigations into Regioselective Rearrangements from Cubanes,"Cuneane is a strained hydrocarbon that can be accessedvia metal-catalyzedisomerization of cubane. The carbon atoms of cuneane define a polyhedronof the C (2v ) point groupwith six faces two triangular, two quadrilateral, and two pentagonal.The rigidity, strain, and unique exit vectors of the cuneane skeletonmake it a potential scaffold of interest for the synthesis of functionalsmall molecules and materials. However, the limited previous syntheticefforts toward cuneanes have focused on monosubstituted or redundantlysubstituted systems such as permethylated, perfluorinated, and bis(hydroxymethylated)cuneanes. Such compounds, particularly rotationally symmetric redundantlysubstituted cuneanes, have limited potential as building blocks forthe synthesis of complex molecules. Reliable, predictable, and selectivesyntheses of polysubstituted cuneanes bearing more complex substitutionpatterns would facilitate the study of this ring system in myriadapplications. Herein, we report the regioselective, Ag-I-catalyzed isomerization of asymmetrically 1,4-disubstituted cubanesto cuneanes. In-depth DFT calculations provide a charge-controlledregioselectivity model, and direct dynamics simulations indicate thatthe nonclassical carbocation invoked is short-lived and dynamic effectsaugment the charge model.",2023
New technology for preparing energetic materials by nanofiltration membrane (NF): rapid and efficient preparation of high-purity ammonium dinitramide (ADN),"The development of environment-friendly and non-toxic green energetic materials and their safe, environmentally friendly, and economical production is very important to the national economy and national security. As an innovative, efficient, and environmentally friendly energetic material, the preferred preparation method of ammonium dinitramide (ADN) is the nitro-sulfur mixed acid method, which has the advantages of high yield, simple method, and easy access to raw materials. However, the large number of inorganic salt ions introduced by this method limits the large-scale production of ADN. Nanofiltration (NF) has been widely used in various industrial processes as a separation method with high separation efficiency and simple operation. In this study, NF was used for the desalination and purification of ADN synthesized by the mixed acid method. The effects of NF types, operation process (pressure, temperature, and feed solution concentration) on desalination efficiency, and membrane flux during purification were examined. The results showed that 600D NF could achieve the efficient desalination and purification of ADN. It was verified that the highest desalination and purification efficiency was achieved at 2 MPa pressure, 25 degrees C, and 1 time dilution of the feed solution, and the membrane flux of the desalination and purification process was stable. Under the optimized process conditions, the removal rate of inorganic salts and other impurities reached 99% (which can be recycled), the purity of ADN reached 99.8%, and the recovery rate reached 99%. This process has the potential for the large-scale production of ADN and provides a new process for the safe, efficient, and cheap preparation of energetic materials.",2023
A Novel Correlation for Predicting the Density of Tetrazole-,"In this study, a new and reliable model is derived for predicting the density of tetrazole N-oxide salts using molecular structure descriptors through multiple linear regression methods (MLR). The proposed model is based on the elemental, functional group and type of molecule descriptors. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the model was 0.9321 for 36 energetic tetrazole N-oxides with different molecular structures as an exploratoryset. The predictive ability of this model has been checked using a cross validation method (Q(LOO)(2) = 0.9325 and Q(LMO)(2) = 0.9324). The new correlation had a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.033 g. cm(-3) and an average absolute deviation (AAD) of 0.025 g. cm(-3). This correlation also gave good predicted results for a further 10 energetic tetrazole N-oxides as a test set. The new reliable model can also be appliedfor designing novel energetic tetrazole N-oxides.",2018
Radiation engineering analysis of shielding materials to assess their ability to protect astronauts in deep space from energetic particle radiation,"An analysis is performed on four typical materials (aluminum, liquid hydrogen, polyethylene, and water) to assess their impact on the length of time an astronaut can stay in deep space and not exceed a design basis radiation exposure of 150 mSv. A large number of heavy lift launches of pure shielding mass are needed to enable long duration, deep space missions to keep astronauts at Or below the exposure value with shielding provided by the vehicle. Therefore, vehicle mass using the assumptions in the paper cannot be the sole shielding mechanism for long duration, deep space missions. As an example, to enable the Mars Design Reference Mission 5.0 with a 400 day transit to and from Mars, not including the 500 day stay on the surface, a minimum of 24 heavy lift launches of polyethylene at 89,375 lbm (40.54 tonnes) each are needed for the 1977 galactic cosmic ray environment. With the assumptions used in this paper, a single heavy lift launch of water or polyethylene can protect astronauts for a 130 day mission before exceeding the exposure value. Liquid hydrogen can only protect the astronauts for 160 days. Even a single launch of pure shielding material cannot protect an astronaut in deep space for more than 180 days using the assumptions adopted in the analysis. It is shown that liquid hydrogen is not the best shielding material for the same mass as polyethylene for missions that last longer than 225 days. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.",2013
"ReaxFF-/g: Correction of the ReaxFF Reactive Force Field for London Dispersion, with Applications to the Equations of State for Energetic Materials","The practical levels of density functional theory (DFT) for solids (LDA, PBE, PW91, B3LYP) are well-known not to account adequately for the London dispersion (van der Waals attraction) so important in molecular solids, leading to equilibrium volumes for molecular crystals similar to 10-15% too high. The ReaxFF reactive force field is based on fitting such DFT calculations and suffers from the same problem. In the paper we extend ReaxFF by adding a London dispersion term with a form such that it has low gradients (lg) at valence distances leaving the already optimized valence interactions intact but behaves as 1/R-6 for large distances. We derive here these lg corrections to ReaxFF based on the experimental crystal structure data for graphite, polyethylene (PE), carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and for energetic materials: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-s-triazine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), and nitromethane (NM). After this dispersion correction the average error of predicted equilibrium volumes decreases from 18.5 to 4.2% for the above systems. We find that the calculated crystal structures and equation of state with ReaxFF-lg are in good agreement with experimental results. In particular, we examined the phase transition between alpha-RDX and gamma-RDX, finding that ReaxFF-lg leads to excellent agreement for both the pressure and volume of this transition occurring at similar to 4.8 GPa and similar to 2.18 g/cm(3) density from ReaxFF-lg vs 3.9 GPa and similar to 2.21 g/cm(3) from experiment. We expect ReaxFF-lg to improve the descriptions of the phase diagrams for other energetic materials.",2011
"Pressure dependent phase transformations of energetic material 2,4-dinitroanisole using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and first principles calculations","The molecular structure of 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) is optimized using Gaussian 09W program, two stable molecular structures with different methoxy group orientations are obtained and vibrational frequencies are calculated for the two optimized molecular structures. DNAN crystal structure is optimized using CASTEP and VASP codes and phonon frequencies are calculated and assigned. Computed frequencies compare well with experimental values. Pressure dependent phase transformation in DNAN is investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Differences between the Raman spectra of DNAN and trinitrotoluene (TNT) point to a larger phonon energy gap in DNAN to be a possible reason for the lower impact sensitivity of DNAN. Appearance of new Raman bands and discontinuity of the bands above 1.3 GPa indicates a phase transformation. Changes in the X-ray diffraction patterns confirm the phase transformation. The transformation of the ambient monoclinic to an orthorhombic structure starts at around 2 GPa. At 6.8 GPa the monoclinic structure completely transforms into orthorhombic with a volume collapse of 10%. Bulk moduli for the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases are estimated as similar to 12 GPa and 27 GPa respectively, pointing to a lower impact sensitivity of the orthorhombic phase.

"Combination of Polynitropyrazole and 5-Amino-1,2,4-oxadiazole Derivatives: An Approach to High Performance Energetic Materials","A series of N-methylene-bridged polynitropyrazoles and 5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives were successfully synthesized. All these compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Noteworthy, a special packing diagram similar to multiparallel ladder (or gene chains) is formed in compound 9 through numerous hydrogen bonding and p-p interactions. On the basis of crystal structure, the energy properties and stability of those compounds were further explored. Results show that thanks to the high density (rho(7) = 1.86 g cm(-3) and rho(8) = 1.84 g cm(-3)), positive heats of formation (Delta H-f(7) = 1090.7 kJ mol(-1) and Delta H-f(8) = 480.3 kJ mol(-1)), and good oxygen balance (OB7 = 0 and OB8 = +6.96%) of compounds 7 and 8, they exhibit excellent detonation performance (D-v = 8897 and 9014 m s(-1), P = 35.2 and 36.7 GPa, respectively), which are comparable to the high explosive, such as RDX and HMX.",2020
"Combination of 1,2,4-Oxadiazole and 1,2,5-Oxadiazole Moieties for the Generation of High-Performance Energetic Materials","Salts generated from linked 1,2,4-oxadiazole/1,2,5-oxadiazole precursors exhibit good to excellent thermal stability, density, and, in some cases, energetic performance. The design of these compounds was based on the assumption that by the combination of varying oxadiazole rings, it would be possible to profit from the positive aspects of each of the components. All of the new compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, H-1, C-13, and (in some cases) N-15 NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (DSC). The structures of 2-3 and 5-15H(2)O were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Theoretical performance calculations were carried out by using Gaussian03 (RevisionD.01). Compound 2-3, with its good density (1.85gcm(-3)), acceptable sensitivity (14J, 160N), and superior detonation pressure (37.4GPa) and velocity (9046ms(-1)), exhibits performance properties superior to those of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX).",2015
"Synthesis and properties of novel nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched dicationic 3,4-diaminotriazolium salts as attractive energetic materials","The incorporation of both fuel and oxidizer properties into a single molecule to effectively improve the oxygen balance of energetic compounds has become one of the most acceptable strategies for the design of modern high-energy-density materials (HEDMs). To identify more powerful and less sensitive HEDMs with favorable oxygen balance, novel nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched dicationic 3,4-diaminotriazolium salts were prepared via the quaternization of 3,4-diamino-triazole with 4,4'-bis(nitramino)azofurazan and 4,4'-bis(nitramino)azoxyfurazan, and then fully characterized. These compounds exhibited favorable thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures up to 216 degrees C, high densities over 1.82 g.cm(-3) as well as acceptable sensitivities. In addition, the two-dimensional fingerprint spectra based on Hirshfeld surface analysis were adopted to illustrate structure-property relationships. Based on the combination of experimentally determined densities and heats of formation calculated with Gaussian 03, the energetic properties were determined using the EXPLO5 v6.02 program. The newly synthesized ionic salts displayed excellent detonation properties (V-d, 9115-9220 m.s(-1); P, 33.9-35.4 GPa), comparable to those of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX), thus highlighting their potential in energetic material applications.

The effect of hydrostatic pressure on melt-castable energetic materials bis-oxadiazole-bis-methylene dinitrate: A density functional theory study,"Using density functional theory calculations, the structural and electronic properties of the melt-castable energetic materials of bis-oxadiazole-bis-methylene dinitrate (BODN) were studied. The calculated lattice parameters, molecular geometry and band gap by the semi-empirical dispersion (Grimme) corrected generalized gradient approximation functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE-G06) are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical results. Also, the pressure effect on BODN was studied in this work. It is found that although the calculated lattice parameters a, b and c are all decreased monotonically with pressure up to 25 GPa, the b-axis is the easiest compressible. The compression behaviors of geometry were investigated, and found the bond C1-N1 and C3-O2 respective in the oxadiazole and alkyl nitric ester groups were more compressible than the others. The molecular interactions were examined by the Hirshfeld surface and 2D-fingerprint analysis. Moreover, the predicted band gap under high-pressure conditions was discussed as well.",2020
Nanosecond-pulsed discharge in liquid nitrogen: optical characterization and production of an energetic non-molecular form of nitrogen-rich material,"Nanosecond-pulsed discharge in liquid nitrogen ignited using a needle electrode and positive 60 kV high voltage pulses was characterized using fast and shadow imaging, as well as optical emission spectroscopy. Estimation of temperature was done using molecular nitrogen emission of second positive system ro-vibrational transition spectra, and the maximum temperature increase is estimated to be similar to 60 K. We also report on the first observations of plasma-generated unstable material from liquid nitrogen, presumably a form of polynitrogen compound.",2019
The effect of the concentration of high-absorbing inclusions on the laser initiation threshold of energetic materials: model and experiment,"A model has been developed which makes it possible to determine the temperature profile arising in energetic materials containing absorbing inclusions when exposed to laser radiation. The model takes into account the dispersion of these inclusions, the time and intensity of irradiation, and the properties of the energetic materials proper. The proposed model explains the obtained experimental data, according to which the dependence of the threshold for NCP initiation on the content of graphene additives is characterized by the minimum of 3 wt. % graphene. In this case, the threshold of initiation is reduced by about 10 times.",2019
"Synthesis, characterization and thermal decomposition mechanism of new 5-amino-3-hydrazinyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-based energetic materials","The construction and comprehensive characterization of energetic ionic salts 5-amino-3-hydrazinyl-1H-1,2,4triazolium diperchlorate (2) and 5-amino-3-hydrazinyl-1H-1,2,4-triazolium 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazolate-5-one (3), which are based on 5-amino-3-hydrazinyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole, were conducted. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed to explore the thermal and kinetic behaviors of the novel energetic ionic salts. An isoconversional approach and non-linear regression analysis were employed to propose accurate kinetic models for characterizing the decomposition of the energetic ionic salts based on the data from DSC and the most possible mechanism functions governing the decomposition of 2 and 3 was determined. Furthermore, experimental measurements and theoretical calculations were employed to examine diverse physicochemical characteristics, including densities, mechanical sensitivities, heat of formation as well as detonation parameters. The findings suggest that salt 2 exhibits a good detonation pressure of 37.4 GP and a satisfactory detonation velocity of 9031 m/s, exceeding RDX in terms of energy content and suggesting its potential as a viable high-energy explosive substitute for RDX. While salt 2 exhibits a slightly lower level of detonation performance than HMX, it possesses better sensitivity, which mean that salt 2 retains a considerable potential for valuable applications.",2024
"1-Trinitromethyl-3,5-dinitro-4-nitroaminopyrazole: Intramolecular Full Nitration and Strong Intermolecular H-Bonds toward Highly Dense Energetic Materials","Full nitration is one of the most effective strategies used in synthesizing high-density energetic materials, but this strategy has reached its limit because the resultant compounds cannot be further functionalized. To overcome this limitation, we present the synergistic action of full nitration and strong intermolecular H-bonding in designing and synthesizing 1-trinitromethyl-3,5-dinitro-4-nitroaminopyrazole (DNTP) with a density that exceeds those of the reported monocyclic CHON compounds. The detonation velocity and specific impulse of DNTP exceed those of 1-trinitromethyl-3,4,5-trinitropyrazole (TTP), HMX, and ADN.",2024
A positional isomer of LLM-116: ,"It has long been a driving force in the development of energetic materials to hunt for novel energetic materials (EMs) with high energy and low sensitivities. Recently, the combination of nitrogen-heterocycles and NNO2 moiety could generate novel energetic derivatives with high energy content and low sensitivity benefiting from the high heat of formation and abundant hydrogen bonding interactions. The critical role of isomerism strategy in tuning the laser ignition combustion performances of EMs is rarely mentioned in the chemical enterprise, although some researches reveal that isomerism strategy has significant effects on their thermal behaviors, mechanical sensitivity and detonation performance. In this work, the positional isomerism of nitramine-pyrazole was investigated, and 3-nitramine-4-nitropyrazole and a series of energetic derivatives were synthesized and well characterized. Their physical properties, energy performance, as well as laser-ignited combustion performance, were further explored. The experimental results showed that all compounds possess excellent detonation pressure, and detonation velocity (P: 26.5 similar to 30.4 GPa, D: 7876 similar to 8377 m s(-1)), which were much better than those of trinitrotoluene (TNT) (P: 19.5 GPa and D: 6881 m s(-1)). Moreover, all of the resulting energetic derivatives exhibited low mechanical sensitivities (IS>40 J). Interestingly, they also had excellent laser ignited combustion properties owing to the NNO2 moiety attached to nitropyrazole backbone.",2024
An efficient strategy for the preparation of insensitive energetic materials: intramolecular cyclization of picrylhydrazone into an indazole derivative,"The intramolecular cyclization reaction of picrylhydrazone into an indazole derivative was systematically studied. The optimized conditions, mechanism and the generality of the cyclization reaction from picrylhydrazone to indazole were investigated. Picrylhydrazones1a-6aand indazole derivatives1band3b-7bwere synthesized through a one-step reaction and the crystal structures of2a,4aand5bwere characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Among all the compounds, the indazole derivatives exhibit an increase of 24-341 m s(-1)(0.3-4.3%), 0.6-3.1 GPa (2.2-14.3%) and 9-82 degrees C (5.0-44.0%) in detonation performance and thermal stability as well as a decrease of 4-10 J (15.4-33.3%) and 50-120 N (16.1-50.0%) in mechanical sensitivity to impact and friction compared with picrylhydrazones. Furthermore, the structure-property relationship was demonstrated by a combination of fingerprint plots, Hirshfeld surfaces and explosive properties. All those results demonstrated that this study can enrich the future prospects of the design of energetic materials.",2020
Rationally Constructed Surface Energy and Dynamic Hard Domains Balance Mechanical Strength and Self-Healing Efficiency of Energetic Linear Polymer Materials,"Polymeric materials that simultaneously possess excellent mechanical properties and high self-healing ability at room temperature, convenient healing, and facile fabrication are always a huge challenge. Herein, we report on surface-energy-driven self-healing energetic linear polyurethane elastomers (EPU) that were facilely fabricated by two-step methods to acquire high healing efficiency and mechanical properties. By constructing surface energy and dynamic hard domains, energetic linear polyurethane elastomers not only obtained high healing ability and mechanical properties at high or room temperature but also avoid the use of some assisted healing conditions and complex chemical structure design and decrease manufacturing difficulty. Based on the interfacial healing physical model, various trends of surface tension, radius, and depth of the crack bottom were calculated to analyze the healing mechanism. We propose that polyurethane elastomers with low junction density could generate excess surface energy resulting from damage and drive self-healing, and incorporating a small amount of disulfide bonds increases the slightly packed hard phase and decreases the healing energy barrier. This work may offer a novel strategy for improving mechanical tensile and healing ability in the field of self-healing material application.",2021

Meanwhile, we also predicted the stability, detonation properties, heats of formation (HOF) and thermodynamic properties of all FTT compounds. Results showed that all compounds have superior HOF far exceeding that of common explosives. In addition, the detonation performance (Q = 1426-1804 cal g(-1); P = 29.54-41.84 GPa; D = 8.02-9.53 km s(-1)), which is superior to 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TATB). It is also concluded that the introduction of coordination oxygen on the tetrazine ring can improve the HOF, density and detonation performance of the title compound, and -NH-NH- bridge and -NHNO2 group are also the perfect combination to increase these values. In view of thermal stability, because of the fascinating performance of D3, E3, F1 and F3 , makes them very attractive to be chosen as HEDMs.",2021

Halogen bonds as a tool in the design of high energetic materials: evidence from crystal structures and quantum chemical calculations,"Positive electrostatic potential over the central area of the molecular surface is one of the main characteristics of high energetic materials (HEMs) that determines their sensitivity towards detonation. The influence of halogen bonds on the values of the electrostatic potential of selected HEM molecules was studied in crystal structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by quantum chemical calculations. Analysis of halogen bonds in crystal structures containing halogen-substituted 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl fragments showed that these groups form halogen bonds (183 contacts). Analysis of electrostatic potential maps calculated for geometries of non-halogen bonded and halogen bonded HEM molecules extracted from crystal structures showed that halogen bonding modifies electrostatic potential in the centers of these compounds. Since in selected crystal structures other types of non-covalent interactions were also present, quantum chemical calculations on model systems were used to reveal and quantitatively describe the influence of halogen bonds on the electrostatic potential of selected HEM molecules. These results could be used for the design of new classes of halogen-containing high energetic molecules with reduced sensitivities towards detonation.",2021
"Investigating the energetic, exergetic, and sustainability aspects of a solar still integrating fins, wick, phase change materials, and external condenser","Renewable-based desalination systems as one of the sources of a chief human sustenance are of tremendous significance to tackle the climatic detriments associated with their fossil fuel-based counterparts. This experi-mental study deals with investigating a double slope solar still (SS) retrofitted with a combination comprising fins, phase change materials (PCM), external condenser (EC), and wick materials (WM). A comprehensive assessment of energy, exergy, economic, exergo-economic, exergo-environmental, and sustainability indicators have been carried out. Results reveal that the SS with all the mentioned modifications, i.e., fins, PCM, EC, WM (Case V) achieved the highest improvement of 32.46 % in daily productivity over the conventional SS (Case I) that achieved a daily baseline yield of 2.28 L/m2. Moreover, SS with fins (Case II), fins and PCM (Case III), fins, PCM, and EC (Case IV), and Case V exhibited respectively 3.49 %, 14.51 %, 28.21 %, and 39.36 % improvement in energy efficiency over the conventional case. Exergy analysis reveals that Case V achieved the maximum efficiency (5.26 %), which is 12.88 %, 25.84 %, 41.78 %, and 64.90 % more than Case IV, Case III, Case II, and Case I, respectively. The payback time for the different solar still configurations based on the energy and exergy analyses has been observed within the reasonable ranges of 0.81-1.23 yr and 10.22-12.64 yr, respectively. The exergo-economic parameter based on energy has been seen to be varying in the range of 62.15-69.39 kWh/$ while the cost of water varied within 0.0082-0.0095 $/L, with the least one attributed to Case V. This experi-mental investigation also substantiates the decrease in waste exergy ratio and the increase in sustainability index by the incorporation of fins and phase change materials with the traditional solar still.",2022
"High-pressure structural, mechanical, and vibrational properties of NAPTO: The first fused-ring energetic material with a 2D layered structure","Understanding the structural-property relationship under extreme conditions is important for energetic materials. Herein, the effects of pressure on the structural, mechanical, and vibrational properties and molecular interactions of the first fused-ring energetic material with a 2D layered structure, 4-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol-[3,4-d]1,2,3-triazine-2-oxide (NAPTO), are determined using density functional theory calculations. The simulated crystal lattice parameters within dispersion corrected scheme are in good agreement with experiment at ambient condition. Also, the elastic constants and mechanical properties were studied in the pressure range of 0-25 GPa. It is found that the ductility, stiffness, and deformation resistance of solid NAPTO are enhanced due to the intensified atom-atom contacts and hydrogen bond interactions under pressure, which is also confirmed by the Hirshfeld surface and 2D-fingerprint plot analysis. Furthermore, based on the hydrogen bond coordination relaxation theory, the pressure-induced frequency shifts of the N-H stretching vibrational modes which marks hydrogen bonding were discussed as well.",2021
"Propagation of a reaction front in a narrow sample of energetic material with heat losses: Chaotic regimes, extinction and intermittency","The influence of heat-losses on the flame dynamics in narrow samples of energetic material is investigated numerically. The model is reduced to a one-dimensional form with the flame-sheet approximation applied for the reaction rate. Both the steady-state solutions and its linear stability analysis are treated analytically. A typical C-shaped response curve is found for the dependence of the flame-propagation velocity on the heat-loss parameter, with solutions along the lower branch of slower flames being always unstable. It is found that a part of the upper branch of the C-shaped response curve is also unstable and the Poincare-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation takes place at a certain value of heat-loss intensity even if the steady state solution is stable under the corresponding adiabatic conditions. The numerical simulations show that an increase in heat-losses induces, for sufficiently high Zel'dovich numbers, the Feigenbaum's cascade of period doubling bifurcations after which a chaotic dynamics is setting in. The chaotic dynamics precedes the flame extinction occurring for the further increase of the heat-loss parameter which, nevertheless, remains significantly lower than the steady extinction limit dictated by the C-shaped response curve. Apparently, the parametric dependence of the extinction time in these cases is also irregular with appreciable disparities in magnitude. Finally, the intermittency effect is detected slightly below the extinction limit with irregular dynamics alternating by apparently periodic stages. These results may be important for the flammability limits theory and practical fire safety applications. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2018
"Equations of state for energetic materials from density functional theory with van der Waals, thermal, and zero-point energy corrections",It is shown that the introduction of zero-point energy and thermal effects to density functional theory with an empirical van der Waals correction results in a significant improvement in the prediction of equilibrium volumes and isothermal equations of state for hydrostatic compressions of energetic materials at nonzero temperatures. This method can be used to predict the thermophysical properties of these materials for a wide range of pressures and temperatures. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

On the morphological long-term development of dumped material in a low-energetic environment close to the German Baltic coast,"The development of the bed bathymetry of an experimental dumping area was followed over three-and-a-half years by means of multibeam echosounder techniques. Two types of material were discharged in the bight of Mecklenburg in the Baltic Sea in approximately 20 m of water depth. One set of the discharges was 2900 m(3) of glacial till and the other set was a 2400 m(3) mixture of glacial till, sand and minor amounts of cohesive matter. Only approximately 2500 m(3) (86%) of the glacial till and 1500 m(3) (63%) of the mixed soil materials were deposited on the seabed. This means that already during the dumping process a considerable part of the sediment material drifted away. The glacial till formed crater-like rings of 30 m diameter with peaks up to 1.4 m above seabed, whereas the spatial structure of the mixed soil material was somewhat more diffuse, but with similar magnitudes in the peaks and troughs. The morphological changes were small and their quantification required a high measuring precision in the order of few cm in the vertical. The dominant processes of surface deformation was flattening of peaks and filling of troughs. The speed of this process decreased with horizontal scale: structures of less than 4 m horizontal extension had a trend to disappear within less than five years, whereas structures of larger than 8 m extension showed little change and are estimated to remain detectable for many decades. In contrast to the reworking of the matter inside the dumping structures, no net transport of material out of the dumping area could be detected. Extrapolating the observed morphological changes into the future it is estimated that without significant decrease in internal shear strength of the disposed till the structures will persist for at least 70 years. This can be attributed to the high internal stability of the dumped glacial till and the low hydrodynamic forces present at the seabed in this region. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Nitration products of 5-amino-1,"The nitration of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (1). 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-tetrazole (3), and 5-amino-2-methyl-2H-tetrazole (4) with HNO3 (100%) was undertaken, and the corresponding products 5-(nitrimino)-1H-tetrazole (2) 1-methyl-5-(nitrimino)-1H-tetrazole (5), and 2-methyl-5-(nitramino)-2H-tetrazole (6) were characterized comprehensively using vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopy, multinuclear (H-1, C-13, N-14, and N-15) NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The molecular structures in the crystalline state were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermodynamic properties and thermal behavior were investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the heats of formation were determined by bomb calorimetric measurements. Compounds 2, 5, and 6 were all found to be endothermic compounds. The thermal decompositions were investigated by gas-phase IR spectroscopy as well as DSC experiments. The heats of explosion, the detonation pressures, and velocities were calculated with the software EXPLO5, whereby the calculated values are similar to those of common explosives such as TNT and RDX. In addition, the sensitivities were tested by BAM methods (drophammer and friction) and correlated to the calculated electrostatic potentials. ne explosion performance of 5 was investigated by Koenen steel sleeve test, whereby a higher explosion power compared to RDX was reached. Finally, the long-term stabilities at higher temperatures were tested by thermal safety calorimetry (FlexyTSC). X-Ray crystallography of monoclinic 2 and 6, and orthorhombic 5 was performed.",2007
Phase transition and trigger mechanism of initial reaction under pressure for benzofuroxan energetic materials: Raman spectroscopy and first-principle calculations,"Low-pressure (below 2 GPa) Raman spectra of benzofuroxan are investigated using a gasketed Mao-Bell-type sapphire anvil cell and Raman spectrometer to clarify the pressure-induced structural change and molecular vibration behavior. The first-principle calculations are performed to compare with the experimental data and to analyze the phase transition and trigger mechanism of initial reaction. Variations of pressure-induced Raman band width, shift, and intensity are examined. The results show that the benzofuroxan molecule will become nonplanar with increasing pressure. A phase transition occurs because of an abrupt redshift in shift-pressure relationship and reduction of the cell volume, appearing of a new vibration band above 0.13 GPa. Several active vibration modes are found, and the effects of the active mode vibrations on the initial decomposition of benzofuroxan are analyzed using the relaxed scan method for the main change in bond length, bond angle, or dihedral angle to obtain the optimal reaction channel leading to initial decomposition. The results demonstrate that the initial decomposition is the open-loop reaction in N(O)-O position, which is originated from the increase of dihedral angle O-C-N(O)-O from the out-of-plane torsional vibration of furoxan ring (518 cm(-1)). The scanning energy barrier related to dihedral angle O-C-N(O)-O is about 22.6 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the calculated activation barrier (18.1 kcal/mol) of open-loop reaction. This proves the reliability of our conclusions.",2021
The elastic constants and related properties of the epsilon polymorph of the energetic material CL-20 determined by Brillouin scattering,"The acoustic phonons of the epsilon polymorph of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazatetracyclo [5.5.0.0(5,9).0(3,11)] dodecane (epsilon-CL-20) have been studied using Brillouin scattering spectroscopy. Analysis of the acoustic phonon velocities allowed determination of the complete stiffness tensor for this energetic material. The results are compared to a theoretical determination of the epsilon-CL-20 elastic constants, bulk moduli, and shear moduli. The observed ordering of elastic constants, C-22 > C-33 > C-11, is noted to be different from other nitramine energetic materials. Finally, the elasticity of epsilon-CL-20 is compared to recently published reports on cyclotrimethylene trinitramine's (RDX) elasticity and the beta polymorph of cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine's (beta-HMX) elasticity.

Probing the Reaction Dynamics of Energetic Materials: The Influence of Physical Properties and Heat Transfer on Ignition and Combustion Characteristics,"Energetic materials convert chemically stored potential energy to kinetic energy through combustion. A current focus within this field is to address the constraints related to mass transfer, which hinder the rapid release of energy from solid-state energetic materials. Nanomaterials have emerged as a promising avenue for overcoming these limitations by reducing the distance between fuels and oxidizers, thereby increasing energy release rates. This dissertation focuses on understanding reaction mechanisms and combustion behavior of solid nanoenergetic composite materials by tuning chemical and physical properties of the components as well as manipulating heat transfer of the composites. Specifically, it sheds light on the crucial role of oxidizer physical properties in influencing the ignition behavior of nanoscale boron, as well as the dominant effect of physical properties of fuels and their corresponding oxides on the microscopic combustion characteristics of composites containing different fuels. A significant portion of this dissertation focuses on tuning the energy release rate of nanoenergetic composites by manipulating heat transfer through various approaches, including: a) Altering the equivalence ratio between fuel and oxidizer, b) Decreasing agglomerate surface tension using an additive, and c) Incorporating carbon fiber to intercept and retain hot agglomerates near the burning surface. These approaches share a common objective of controlling the residence time of agglomerates on or near the burning surface, with longer residence times resulting in increased heat feedback and, consequently, higher energy release rates. Additionally, this dissertation explores the development of energetic biocidal agents using a series of metal iodates by studying their decomposition mechanisms and combustion behavior of assembled composites with nanoscale aluminum as the fuel.",2024
New Solvent-Free Melting-Assisted Preparation of Energetic Compound of Nickel with Imidazole for Combustion Synthesis of Ni-Based Materials,"In this work two approaches to the synthesis of energetic complex compound Ni(Im)(6)(NO3)(2) from imidazole and nicklel (II) nitrate were applied: a traditional synthesis from solution and a solvent-free melting-assisted method.

"Solvent Free Potassium 3,5-dinitro-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrazin-2-olate 3D EMOF as Thermally Stable Energetic Material","Heat-resistant explosives play a vital role in indispensable applications. For this, we have synthesized a novel, three-dimensional, solvent-free energetic metal-organic framework (EMOF) potassium 3,5-dinitro-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrazin-2-olate (KDNODP) straightforwardly. The synthesized EMOF was characterized through IR, NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry studies. Furthermore, single-crystal X-ray diffraction provided a complete description of KDNODP. It exhibits a three-dimensional EMOF structure with remarkably balanced properties such as high density (2.11 g cm-3), excellent thermal stability (291 degrees C), good detonation performance (8127 m s-1 and 26.94 GPa) and low mechanical sensitivity (IS=35 J; FS=360 N) than the commonly used heat-resistant explosives HNS (density=1.74 g cm-3; VOD=7164 m s-1, DP=21.65 GPa, IS=5 J) as well as the similar reported energetic potassium MOFs. To gain insights into the packing and intermolecular interactions, the Hirshfeld surface and a 2D fingerprint analysis were examined. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the particle size and morphological characteristics of KDNODP. These outcomes highlight a successful method for creating 3D EMOF based on a six-membered heterocycle as a potential heat-resistant energetic material.

Comparative Study of Experiments and Calculations on the Guest Molecules' Escaping Mechanism of CL-20-Based Host-Guest Energetic Materials,"CL-20-based host-guest energetic materials havehigh applicationvalue in the field of energetic materials. The phase-transition inhibitionand stabilization mechanisms of CL-20-based host-guest energeticmaterials were revealed by combining experiments with molecular dynamics(MD) simulation. Based on the crystal structures, the super-cell modelsof host-guest energetic materials including CL-20/H2O, CL-20/H2O2, CL-20/N2O, and CL-20/CO2 were constructed. The phase transformation behavior and stabilitysequence of CL-20-based host-guest energetic materials wereinvestigated using MD integrated with in situ powder X-ray diffraction(PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry (DSC-TG)experiments. The escaping abilities of guest molecules from (002),(020), (021), (102), and (111) crystal faces of CL-20/H2O, CL-20/H2O2, CL-20/N2O, and CL-20/CO2 were evaluated using the target-MD method. It is proposedthat the guest molecules could escape from the (002) crystal facemore easily than the other faces. The escaping behaviors were studiedusing MD simulations. Based on the analysis of mean-square displacement(MSD), diffusion coefficients, and binding energies at different temperatures,the thermal stability order of the four CL-20-based host-guestmaterials was CL-20/CO2 > CL-20/N2O >CL-20/H2O2 > CL-20/H2O. This isconsistent withexperimental observations by in situ XRD and DSC analyses on thesehost-guest energetic materials. Meanwhile, by studying theescape paths of guest molecules, it was concluded that the escapemethod of guest molecules from a CL-20 crystal cell is ""jumping""diffusion. By studying the MSD of host molecule CL-20 and the radialdistribution function between the host molecule and the guest molecule,the structural stabilization mechanism of host-guest energeticmaterials was revealed. Our findings will help to reveal the solid-phase-transitioninhibition mechanism of host-guest energetic materials andpromote the development of host-guest explosives as smart materials.",2023

Multi-scale modeling of shock initiation of a pressed energetic material I: The effect of void shapes on energy localization,"Accurate simulations of the shock response of heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials require closure models, which account for energy localization in the micro-structure. In a multi-scale framework, closure is provided by reaction rate models that account for ignition and growth of hotspots, allowing for prediction of the overall macro-scale sensitivity of a HE material. In the present meso-informed ignition and growth (MES-IG) model, the reaction rate is expressed as a function of shock pressure and morphology of the void field in a pressed energetic material. In MES-IG, the void morphology is quantified in terms of a limited number of parameters: viz., overall porosity, void size, and shape (aspect ratio and orientation). In this paper, we quantify the effects of arbitrary variations in void shapes on meso-scale energy deposition rates. A collection of voids of arbitrary shapes is extracted from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of real, pressed HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) samples and classified into groups based on their similarity in shapes. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed on the highly contorted ""real "" void shapes, and the calculated hotspot ignition and growth rates are compared with values predicted by the MES-IG. It is found that while the parameterization of complex void morphologies in terms of orientation and aspect ratio gives fairly good agreement between DNS and MES-IG reaction rates, the intricate details of highly complex void shapes impact hotspot characteristics to a significant extent. This work suggests possible improvements for the prediction of reaction rate in the energetic microstructure by adopting a more detailed description of shapes.",2022

Radiation engineering analysis of shielding materials to assess their ability to protect astronauts in deep space from energetic particle radiation,"This paper explores the changes in the radiation quantity whole body effective dose equivalent (E) caused by galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) by varying position, geometry, material, and thickness of radiation shielding in order to determine possible launch characteristics of a vehicle design. The On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS) was used to simulate deep space missions lasting 180 or 400 days with a mission radiation surrogate exposure limit of 150 mSv. Previous work used only spherical shielding; however, the shielding geometries investigated in this paper were right circular cylinders and spheres comprised of aluminum, polyethylene, liquid methane, water, and liquid hydrogen. Materials were evaluated individually, in multimaterial pressure vessel mock-ups, and personal protection forms for individual astronauts. With single-material shielding, a single launch of shielding material to low Earth orbit (LEO) was possible for all materials for a 180 day mission, but insufficient for a 400 day mission. Multi-material and personal protection forms, as well, were found to be suitable for a 180 day mission, but not for a 400 day mission. Overall, no feasible designs in these analyses were able to meet the surrogate limit and protect an astronaut for 400 days.",2020
Effect of interfacial heat transfer on the critical conditions of shock-wave initiation of chemical reaction in porous energetic materials,"This paper presents the results of numerical analysis of a viscoplastic model for hotspot formation based on the solid-state mechanism of hotspot ignition of an energetic porous material under shock-wave loading. The highly viscous pore collapse regime is considered, which is of great interest for theoretical studies of the shock-wave initiation of heterogeneous energetic materials. Interfacial heat transfer was described under the assumption that the gas is ideal and hence homobaric (uniform in pressure).

Boosting intermolecular interactions of fused cyclic explosives: the way to thermostable and insensitive energetic materials with high density,"Density is a crucial factor affecting the energetic performance of explosives. However, the method of increasing density by introducing sensitive high-energy substituents is at the expense of molecular stability. Here, the packing efficiency of energetic materials was enhanced by boosting the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding and pi-type interactions. Two fused cyclic tetrazine explosives with strong hydrogen bonds and edge-to-face stacking were successfully obtained via facile and effective nucleophilic substitution reaction and a series of their salts were also synthesized. All the compounds were fully characterized by IR, multinuclear NMR spectra, elemental analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Four of them were also structurally characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The physicochemical properties of all the compounds were investigated. The results show that the strong intermolecular interactions give the neutral compounds high density while maintaining low mechanical sensitivity, high thermal stability and good detonation property. The hydroxylammonium and hydrazinium salts show comparable detonation velocities with RDX while exhibiting superior mechanical insensitivities. These findings demonstrate that boosting intermolecular interactions of fused cyclic explosives is promising in obtaining novel high density energetic materials.",2021
Preparation and study on combustion performance of AP@ZrH 2 core-shell composite energetic materials with high volume energy density,"The development of composite energetic material with high volume energy density could increase the range and loading capacity of solid propellants. In this study, a series of core -shell composite energetic materials AP@ZrH 2 were fabricated by decorating ZrH 2 on the ammonium perchlorate (AP) through a solvent-nonsolvent method. A substantial increase in combustion heat (13373.67 J/g) and maximum burning temperature (1415.33 degrees C) are detected in composites in contrast to physically mixed sample (10660.46 J/g and 837.22 degrees C). This is due to the enhancement of the decomposition performance of AP, which provides sufficient oxidation gas atmosphere for combustion of ZrH 2 . In addition, the delay time (524 ms) and burning time (114 ms) of composites are significantly decreased compared to the physical mixed sample (2145 and 256 ms). The remarkable combustion performance and burning rate could be attributed to reduced mass and heat transfer distances. Finally, the improvement of combustion efficiency in the composites makes the size of the residual particles smaller. (c) 2024 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Experimental and modeling studies of binary organic eutectic systems to be used as stabilizers for nitrate esters-based energetic materials,"Four binary mixtures with potential for stabilizing energetic materials have been investigated. The phase diagrams of N-(2-methoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline + diphenylamine, N-(2-methoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline + N-(2-acetoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline, N-(2-methoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline + 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and N-(2-methoxyethyl)-p-nitroaniline + 1,3-diethyl-1,3-diphenylurea have been determined by differential scantling calorimetry. All systems display a simple eutectic behavior. Consistency tests have been applied to inspect the quality of the SLE data, showing very satisfactory quality factors. The SLE data have also been correlated by Wilson and NRTL models. The employed equations calculated the equilibrium temperatures with a root mean square deviations varying from 1.37 to 2.29 K. These models have been applied to compute the excess thermodynamic functions as well, giving highly comparable values for a further qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show a positive deviation from ideality for all the investigated systems due to the dominant effect of the self-association molecules. The XRD studies revealed the existence of weak interactions between the components in the formed eutectics and suggested that they are mechanical systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Development of NiO-Nanocarbon and MnO,"Automobile and transportation on land and in air are the major causes of global environment pollution through the chemical combustion of petroleum fuels. The need of the hour is to run the transportation units by fuel cells which convert fuels to energy through electrochemical oxidation, straight to pure electrical energy with no polluting substances. Development of fuel cell lies on exhaustive research on development of high energetic electrocatalytic electrodes over which the fuels break to produce free electron and ions, delivering electrical energy. The present work aims at developing two electrocatalytic materials: NiO-nanocarbon and MnO2-nanocarbon by electrosynthesis method. The performance of the materials was investigated by electrochemical characterization: cyclic voltammetry, chronoammetry, polarization tests and impedance spectroscopy. The materials were found to deliver a high current on electro-oxidation of glucose. The effect of nanocarbon on NiO and MnO2 has enhanced the current to a level of over 100 mA/cm(2). XRD study showed the presence of metal oxides and carbon. The electron microscopy images revealed fine grain oxides with entrapped nanocarbon. The carbon seems to be in the form of graphene, produced during electrochemical exfoliation at anode.

Construction of zwitterionic 3D hydrogen-bonded networks: Exploring the upper-limit of thermal stability in ternary CHN-based energetic materials,"Two energetic zwitterionic CHN compounds 5-(1,3-diamino-5-iminio-1,5-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)tetrazole (5) and 5-(6,7-diamino-3-iminio-3H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazol-2(7H)-yl)tetrazole (6) were synthesized effectively by using a straightforward one-step synthetic route. With a rational arrangement of amino and tetrazole units as hydrogen bond (HB) donors and acceptors, 6 has more HB acceptors and displays a layer-by-layer structure. In comparison, the crystal packing of 5 displays twisted layers. In addition, the N-amino group of 6 contributes to inter-layer hydrogen-bonded interactions, thereby giving rise to a three-dimensional hydrogen bonded network. Benefiting from unique structural features, the decomposition temperature of 6 is 371 degrees C, which approaches the relatively excellent among energetic ternary CHN compounds.

"Multi-scale thermal, energetic and economic analysis of composite insulating materials made of silica aerogel in a fibrous inorganic mat","Composite materials made of silica aerogel in a fibrous inorganic mat, hereafter called ""aerogel blankets "", represent promising insulating materials that can overcome the low mechanical resistance of monolithic aerogels, while preserving their very low thermal conductivity. Firstly, this paper details an experimentally validated mathematical model to predict the aerogel blankets' effective thermal conductivity, as a function of the blankets' density, fiber volume fraction, and temperature. Secondly, an experimental test building retrofitted internally with a layer of needle glass fiber (NGF) aerogel blanket is monitored, and its thermal behavior is compared to the baseline case before the retrofit. The retrofitted wall U-value is derived from experimental data series using stationary and transient parametric methods. Then, a validated whole building Energy Plus numerical model is used to predict the annual energy consumption of a detached single-family house retrofitted with an NGF aerogel blanket, in the climates of Brussels (Belgium), Nice (France), and Stockholm (Sweden). Lastly, a 1-D COMSOL multiphysics model evaluates the economic profitability of installing the blanket as an interior thermal insulation system. Results show that the aerogel blankets have an effective thermal conductivity of about 0.0165 W.m(-1).K-1. The designed mathematical model can reliably predict the gaseous conduction in the blanket, but deviations from the experimental measurements appear when considering the radiative and solid conduction components. The blanket's effective thermal conductivity increases with fiber volume fraction and temperature while its dependency curve to density is concave, with a minimum for densities of around 140 kg. m(-3). Retrofitting a wall with 2.5 cm of NGF aerogel blanket as an internal insulation system almost doubles the thermal resistance of the experimental wall and decreases the heating load by more than 40 % in all tested climates. Internal thermal insulation with aerogel blankets is more profitable than conventional insulation materials, in places of high floor area price, because it can preserve the indoor living space.

New atom/group volume additivity method to compensate for the impact of strong hydrogen bonding on densities of energetic materials,"The quantitative impact of strong hydrogen bonding on the densities of energetic materials is discussed. On the basis of our new volume parameters designated for neutral high-energy density materials, the volume of each NH2 or NH group must be corrected by -8 angstrom(3) to Compensate for strong bonding: i.e., (1) when both carbon atoms vicinal to an NH2 or NH group have nitro groups or one C-NO2 and one N-oxide; or (2) if the molecule has C2 symmetry, e.g., at least two nitro and two NH2 groups in the vicinal position, two NH2 groups may be corrected by -8 angstrom(3) in total (exemplified by 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7), 2,4,6-triamino-3,5-dinitropyridine (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) Refcode: TIBMUM), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrimidine (CCDC refcode: CIWMAW01, etc.); or (3) when some heterocycles (triazole, pyrazole, etc.) contain the fragment -NHNO2.

Multi-scale modeling of shock initiation of a pressed energetic material. II. Effect of void-void interactions on energy localization,"Heterogeneous energetic materials (EMs) contain microstructural defects such as voids, cracks, interfaces, and delaminated zones. Under shock loading, these defects offer potential sites for energy localization, i.e., hotspot formation. In a porous EM, the collapse of one void can generate propagating blast waves and hotspots that can influence the hotspot phenomena at neighboring voids. Such void-void interactions must be accounted for in predictive multi-scale models for the reactive response of a porous EM. To infuse such meso-scale phenomena into a multi-scale framework, a meso-informed ignition and growth model (MES-IG) has been developed, where the influence of void-void interactions is incorporated into the overall reaction rate through a function, f(v-v). Previously, MES-IG was applied to predict the sensitivity and reactive response of EM, where f(v-v) was assumed to be a function of the overall sample porosity alone. This paper performs a deeper analysis to model the strong dependency of f(v-v) on other factors, such as void size and shock strength. The improved model for void-void interactions produces good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the HE microstructures and, thus, advances the predictive capability of multi-scale models of the shock response and sensitivity of EM.

To meet these needs, a novel heat-resistant energetic compound 3-(3,5-dinitrophenyl)-5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazole (3) with low mechanical sensitivity on the basis of combining dinitrobenzene and aminooxadiazole was synthesized through a simple method in this work. The structures of energetic intermediate 3-(3,5-dinitrophenyl)-5-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole (2) and 3 were characterized by NMR (H-1 and C-13), infrared spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The results showed that both 2 and 3 are mechanically insensitive (IS > 60 J, FS > 360 N) and heat-resistant (T-d = 270 and 320 degree celsius, respectively) with detonation properties (D = 6135 and 6396 m s(-1), P = 15.7 and 15.2 GPa) and both have relatively low melting points (T-m = 127 and 164 degree celsius, respectively).",2024
HMX surface modification with polymers via sc-CO2 antisolvent process: A way to safe and easy-to-handle energetic materials,"The continuous need for energetic materials with increased performance and improved safety characteristics stimulates synthetic efforts as well as physical modification of existing compounds. The present study reports the fabrication of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX)-based composites with common commercial polymers, polymethyl acrylate (PMA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene rubber (ABS), ethyl cellulose (EC), polylactide (PLA), and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). To precipitate the polymer on the HMX particles, the supercritical CO2-based anti-solvent method was employed. Surface state studies with various modes of scanning probe microscopy show that the polymers at less than 3 wt% content do not form a continuous layer but precipitate as globular islands. Nevertheless, the coating effectively absorbs the mechanical stress, resulting in a much lower sensitivity to impact and a considerable improvement of the HMX friction sensitivity. Specifically, for HMX@3PMA composite the impact and friction sensitivities are 54 J and 240 N, as compared to 7 J and 150 N for neat HMX. Additionally, the beneficial improvement of flowability is observed for the fabricated composites, and evidenced by small-scale flow cup studies. Importantly, the suggested procedure affords the safe and easy-to-handle energetic material powder containing only 1-3 wt% of the polymer additive.",2022
Energetic and thermal comfort assessment of phase change material passively incorporated building envelope in severe hot Climate: An experimental study,"Phase change materials (PCMs) can beneficially work as a successful thermal energy storage medium in different applications. PCMs have shown a remarkable enhancement in building energy-saving and thermal comfort in hot locations. In this paper, the thermal behaviour of a PCM-enhanced thermally-poor building envelope is studied experimentally. To this aim, two identical rooms, one loaded with PCM (PCM room) and the other without (reference room), are built and tested under a severe hot climate of Al Amarah city, Iraq. Previously examined parameters, such as the optimal position and thickness of the PCM layer in the roof and the best-thermally performed PCM capsules integrated concrete bricks, are considered to build the PCM room. Several energetic and thermal comfort indicators such as maximum temperature reduction (MTR), average temperature fluctuation reduction (ATFR), decrement factor (DF), time lag (TL), operative temperature difference (OTD), discomfort hours reduction (DHR) and maximum heat gain reduction (MHGR) are determined and discussed to show the potential of PCM. The experimental results revealed that the incorporated PCM could remarkably improve the thermal performance of building envelope exposed to high outdoor temperatures. Amongst envelope elements and compared with the reference room, the roof and east wall of the PCM room recorded the best thermal behaviour, where the MTR difference, ATFR, DF, and TL difference reached 3.75 ?, 6.5 ?, 25.6%, 70 min for the roof, and 2.75 ?, 2.4 ?, 12.8% and 40 min for the east wall, respectively. Moreover, the PCM room shows a thermal comfort enhancement by 11.2% and 34.8%, considering the DHR and MHGR, respectively, compared with the reference one. The study highlighted that suitable ventilation means are necessary to improve the building performance and reach acceptable thermal comfort when the PCM is incorporated passively.",2022

Mechanical behavior and optimization of constitutive prediction model for Epoxy/Al energetic composite materials considering temperature and strain rate effects,"Epoxy/Al as a functional structural energetic composite material that can be used as an adhesive, energetic fragments and warhead shells due to its high energy density, low density, and high strength. It can release a large amount of chemical energy (about 21.36 kJ/g) through chemical reactions when subjected to high-speed impact and thermal stimulation. Whether used as a matrix or auxiliary component, it has enormous development potential. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the mechanical properties of Epoxy/Al energetic composite materials under different temperature environments and strain rates of loading. This article describes the preparation of Epoxy/Al specimens with a mass percentage of 70%-30% using vacuum curing after 24 h under 0.8 Bar and 50 & DEG;C. The mechanical properties of Epoxy/Al specimens under different loading conditions were characterized using a high and low temperature universal testing machine and a separate Hopkinson experimental system. The modulus prediction method of binary composite materials was improved by combining SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and microstructure, and an adaptive constitutive model was developed combined with the K Srinivas model and neural network model based on the Sherwood Frost empirical constitutive relationship. The results show that Epoxy/Al energetic composite material has a significant temperature effect. When the temperature exceeds 100 & DEG;C, Epoxy/Al energetic composite material will be a significant physical and chemical property transition (the specimen exhibits viscous fluid characteristics and gradually begins to slowly decompose). As the temperature decreases, the specimen gradually exhibits a certain degree of brittleness and strength is improved. Due to the deformation, displacement, and interfacial debonding of internal particles during the loading process, Epoxy/Al materials exhibit excellent impact energy absorption effects, with energy absorption reaching 15.30 MJ/m3 at room temperature, and unit mass cost much lower than popular CFRP (carbon fiber-reinforced polymer) materials (CFRP energy absorption cost is 0.268 J/g/& POUND;, while Epoxy/Al materials do not exceed 0.013 J/g/& POUND;). During the dynamic loading process, Epoxy/Al energetic composite materials exhibit a phenomenon of structural reconstruction and enhancement throughout the entire loading process. The maximum strength at room temperature can reach 240.70 MPa, which is superior to all existing energetic materials of the same type. By introducing interface effects and quantifying them in the Halpin Tsai model, the existing prediction method for the Young's modulus of binary particle added composite materials has been effectively improved, reducing the prediction error of the Young's modulus of Epoxy/Al energetic composite materials from 14.2% to 2.4%. The numerical simulation results indicate that the newly developed constitutive model has high accuracy and can better reflect the mechanical properties of Epoxy/Al materials. The development method of this constitutive model has a positive contribution to the development of composite materials.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nitramino-furazan-functionalized fused high-nitrogen backbones as energetic materials with high detonation performance and good molecular stabilities,"A series of promising fused energetic materials is investigated through the combination of nitramino-1,2,5-oxadiazole and fused high-nitrogen backbones. All new compounds were well characterized by infrared radiation and multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and elemental analysis. Some of them were further studied by using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The heats of formation of all the energetic compounds were calculated using Gaussian 09. With high nitrogen contents (49.3-61.2%) and tremendous ring-strain energy, these fused compounds show high positive heats of formation ranging from 1.13 to 3.04 kJ g(-1), much higher than those of RDX (0.32 kJ g(-1)) and HMX (0.25 kJ g(-1)). Their energetic properties were evaluated with EXPLO5. Among them, high-nitrogen salts exhibit high densities, excellent detonation performance, and good molecular stabilities, similar to the secondary explosive HMX, and thereby highlight their potential applications as new promising energetic materials.",2019

"Determining the mechanical and decomposition properties of high energetic materials (α-RDX, β-HMX, and ε-CL-20) using a neural network potential","Molecular simulations of high energetic materials (HEMs) are limited by efficiency and accuracy. Recently, neural network potential (NNP) models have achieved molecular simulations of millions of atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) levels. Herein, an NNP model covering typical HEMs containing C, H, N, and O elements is developed. The mechanical and decomposition properties of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (HMX), and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) are determined by employing the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the NNP model. The calculated results show that the mechanical properties of alpha-RDX, beta-HMX, and epsilon-CL-20 agree with previous experiments and theoretical results, including cell parameters, equations of state, and elastic constants. In the thermal decomposition simulations, it is also found that the initial decomposition reactions of the three crystals are N-NO2 homolysis, corresponding radical intermediates formation, and NO2-induced reactions. This decomposition trajectory is mainly divided into two stages separating from the peak of NO2: pyrolysis and oxidation. Overall, the NNP model for C/H/N/O elements in this work is an alternative reactive force field for RDX, HMX, and CL-20 HEMs, and it opens up new potential for future kinetic study of nitramine explosives. NNP models covering three typical C/H/N/O element HEMs were developed to capture the mechanical and decomposition properties of RDX, HMX and CL-20. The decomposition trajectory is mainly divided into two stages: pyrolysis and oxidation.",2024
"[N-N=N-N]-linked fused triazoles with π-π stacking and hydrogen bonds: Towards thermally stable, Insensitive, and highly energetic materials","It is the main task and challenge to reach a fine balance between high energy density and good molecular stability in energetic material research. In this study, two series of energetic compounds, 3-amino-7,7'-azo-[1,2,4] triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazole and 3,6-diamino-7,7'-azo-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4] triazole featuring the N-4 [N-N=N-N] linkage and fused triazoles, are presented. Their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Their properties were studied in terms of density, thermal stability, detonation performance, and mechanical sensitivity. The N-4 [N-N=N-N] linkages accord these compounds with high heat of formation, thus increasing the detonation performance. All fused triazoles exhibit planar structures, which result in low mechanical sensitivity. Through careful investigation of crystal data, strong pi-pi stacking and extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions were observed between molecules, which gives positive impact on mechanical sensitivity and thermal stability. The properties between different cations (or ions) were carefully studied. Quantum chemistry calculations were performed to investigate the potential relationship between structures and properties. Among them, compound 5 possesses high thermal stability (T-d: 275 degrees C), good detonation performance (D: 8677 m s(-1); P: 36.1 GPa), and excellent insensitivity (IS: 40 J; FS: 360 N), which makes it a balanced and promising energetic material.",2021
Lyman α photolysis of solid nitromethane (CH,"Solid nitromethane (CH3NO2) along with its isotopically labelled counterpart D3-nitromethane (CD3NO2) ices were exposed to Lyman alpha photons to investigate the mechanism involved in the decomposition of energetic materials in the condensed phase. The chemical processes in the ices were monitored online and in situ via infrared spectroscopy complimented by temperature programmed desorption studies utilizing highly sensitive reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with pulsed photoionization (ReTOF-PI) at 10.49 eV. The infrared data revealed the formation of cis-methylnitrite (CH3ONO), formaldehyde (H2CO), water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Upon sublimation of the irradiated samples, three classes of higher molecular weight products, which are uniquely formed in the condensed phase, were identified via ReTOF-PI: (i) nitroso compounds [nitrosomethane (CH3NO), nitrosoethane (C2H5NO), nitrosopropane (C3H7NO)], (ii) nitrite compounds [methylnitrite (CH3ONO), ethylnitrite (C2H5ONO), propylnitrite (C3H7ONO)], and (iii) higher molecular weight molecules [CH3NONOCH3, CH3NONO2CH3, CH3OCH2NO2, ONCH2CH2NO2]. The mechanistical information obtained in the present study suggest that the decomposition of nitromethane in the condensed phase is more complex compared to the gas phase under collision-free conditions opening up not only hitherto unobserved decomposition pathways of nitromethane (hydrogen atom loss, oxygen atom loss, retro carbene insertion), but also the blocking of several initial decomposition steps due to the 'matrix cage effect'.",2015
Amphoteric Ionization and Cocrystallization Synergistically Applied to Two Melamine-Based ,"The development of new energetic materials with good comprehensive performance often occurs at a glacial pace because of the contradiction between energy and safety. Herein, the synergy between amphoteric ionization and cocrystallization is found to be an effective strategy for regulating the comprehensive performance of energetic materials. The strategy was successfully applied to two amphoteric melamine-based N-oxides, namely 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine 1,3-dioxide (TTDO) and 4,6-diamino-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine 1-oxide (DDTO). Pairing protonated and deprotonated TTDO and DDTO with different anions and cations allowed us to obtain many new energetic compounds with various properties. Among them, the perchlorate salts TTDO+PCL- and DDTO+PCL- composed of the oxidant component ClO4- and oxidant-deficient TTDO or DDTO exhibit satisfying detonation performance but poor safety as for many high-energetic compounds. Hence, a cocrystallization strategy of cocrystallizing energetic compounds with positive and negative oxygen balances (OBs) was successfully used for DDTO+PCL- and DDTO, resulting in the formation of the energetic cocrystal (DDTO+PCL-)center dot DDTO with outstanding comprehensive performance. (DDTO+PCL-)center dot DDTO overcomes the general detonation performance tradeoff disadvantage of cocrystals, and its safety, especially the thermal safety, is superior to that of DDTO+PCL-. The crystal structure cohesion and the reason for the increasing stability of the cocrystal (DDTO+PCL-)center dot DDTO were analyzed. Our study provides an inspiration for regulating the comprehensive performance of energetic materials.",2022
Exploring the reactive chemistry of FOX-7: synthesis of cyclic triazinane-based energetic materials featuring the FOX-7 backbone,"New derivatization reactions of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) are explored, which afford three cyclic triazinane-based energetic compounds 1, 2 and 3 featuring the FOX-7 backbone. Their structures were characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis. Among them, compound 1 shows a high detonation performance (v(D): 8899 m s(-1), P: 35.83 GPa) comparable to that of FOX-7. Compound 2 exhibits a good detonation performance (v(D): 8332 m s(-1), P: 26.47 GPa) and good thermal stability (T-d = 188 degrees C), which is superior to that of most FOX-7-derived energetic compounds. Both of them inherit the low-sensitivity characteristic of FOX-7 because of strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. The presented derivatization reaction has contributed to the ever-expanding chemistry of FOX-7.",2019
"Application of the Peng-Robinson Equation of State to Energetic Materials RDX and TNT: Pure Components, Liquid Mixtures, and Solid Mixtures","Energetic materials are substances that can undergo rapid, exothermic reactions when subjected to an external stimulus, such as heating. In this work, we show that the well-known Peng-Robinson equation of state can be applied to energetic materials, whether they are pure components, liquid mixtures, or solid mixtures. We are specifically interested in two energetic materials: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT). We model RDX and TNT in both their liquid and solid phases, as well liquid and solid mixtures of the two compounds. Our work examines temperatures and pressures as high as about 500 K and 2500 bar, respectively. The Peng-Robinson equation of state provides a good representation of experimental volumetric (e.g., density and bulk modulus), thermal (heat capacity), and phase behavior (melting temperature and solubility) data. It can be applied to other energetic materials ranging in complexity from pure components to multiphase, multicomponent mixtures by adapting the procedures described in this study.",2016
"High pressure structural behaviour of 5,5′-bitetrazole-1,1′-diolate based energetic materials: a comparative study from first principles calculations","Pressure on the scale of gigapascals can cause incredible variations in the physicochemical and detonation characteristics of energetic materials. As a continuation of our earlier work (B. Moses Abraham,et al.,Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018,20, 29693-29707), here we report the high pressure structural and vibrational properties of 5,5 '-bitetrazole-1,1 '-diolate based energetic ionic saltsviadispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, these energetic materials exhibit anisotropic behavior along three crystallographic directions with progressing pressure; especially, the maximum and minimum reduction in volume is observed for HA-BTO and TKX-50, respectively. The large bulk modulus of TKX-50 (28.64) indicates its hard nature when compared to other BTO-based energetic salts. The effect of pressure on hydrogen bonded D-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISA energetic materials induces spectral shift (lengthening/shortening) in the donor group (D-H) of the stretching vibrations and is widely recognized as the signature of hydrogen bonding. We observed unusual contraction of the D-H bond under compression due to the short range repulsive forces encountered by the H atom while the molecule attempts to stabilize. The Hirshfeld surface analysis highlights the pressure induced stabilization of HA-BTO due to increased NMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISH/HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISN and OMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISH/HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO close contact of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. These studies provide theoretical guidance as a function of pressure, on how the micro-structures and intermolecular interactions can tune macroscopic properties to enhance the energetic performance.",2020
"Compounds based on 3-amino-4-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) furazan as insensitive energetic materials","3-Amino-4-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) furazan was synthesized by reacting 4-amino-N'-hydroxy-1,2,5-oxadiazole- 3-carboximidamide with acetamide at a high temperature of 180 degrees C. N-Trinitroethylamino derivatives and energetic salts based on 3-amino-4-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) furazan, which is a combination of 1,2,5- and 1,2,4-oxadizaole rings, were synthesized and fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR, and elemental analysis. And, the structures of compounds 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 were further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal stabilities of 1-12 were determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicating that the reported compounds have moderate thermal stabilities (172-246 degrees C, except for 3 159 degrees C). Compounds 1, 4-12 are insensitive towards impact (>= 40.1 J) and friction (>= 360 N) which were measured by standardized impact and friction tests. Detonation performance was obtained based on the calculated heats of formation and measured densities which indicated that most of these materials are superior to TNT.",2017

"Initial decomposition mechanism for the energy release from electronically excited energetic materials: FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene, C","Decomposition of the energetic material FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene, C2H4N4O4) is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product subsequent to electronic excitation. The observed NO product is rotationally cold (< 35 K) and vibrationally hot (2800 K). The initial decomposition mechanism is explored at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF(12,8)/6-31G(d) level illustrate that conical intersections play an essential role in the decomposition mechanism. Electronically excited S-2 FOX-7 can radiationlessly relax to lower electronic states through (S-2/S-1)(CI) and (S-1/S-0)(CI) conical intersections and undergo a nitro-nitrite isomerization to generate NO product on the S-0 state. The theoretically predicted mechanism is consistent with the experimental results. As FOX-7 decomposes on the ground electronic state, thus, the vibrational energy of the NO product from FOX-7 is high. The observed rotational energy distribution for NO is consistent with the final transition state structure on the S-0 state. Ground state FOX-7 decomposition agrees with previous work: the nitro-nitrite isomerization has the lowest average energy barrier, the C-NH2 bond cleavage is unlikely under the given excitation conditions, and HONO formation on the ground state surface is energy accessible but not the main process.

Replacement of an Azide Group with Carbonyl-Azide in Nitrogen-Rich Energetic Materials: Searching for Possible Alternatives with a Computational Approach,"This work describes the computational design of nitrogen-rich carbonyl-azides as promising energetic materials. Carbonyl-azide group is introduced by replacing azide functionality in 5- and 6-membered nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds and inquired using density functional theory (DFT). The energetic properties including density, heat of formation (HOF), velocity of detonation, detonation pressure, explosive power, flame temperature and sensitivity have been computed with well-known approaches. The predicted results reveal that the replacement of azide with carbonyl-azide helping to acquire higher densities but undesirable towards achieving higher HOF and detonation properties. The sensitivity correlation with heat of detonation indicates that the carbonyl-azide group is more beneficial for reducing the sensitivity than azide group. The predicted energetic properties of carbonyl-azides were compared with corresponding azide explosives and imply their explosophoric nature.",2018

No evidence of polymorphism was observed over this pressure range, indicating that the ambient structure of MAD-X1 remains stable up to conditions similar to the detonation pressure of the material. Additionally, such findings suggest that this high performance material can serve as an insensitive RDX replacement in energetic formulations without the concern of uncontrolled polymorphism that might otherwise affect the performance and safety of the munition.",2019

Initial Decomposition of HMX Energetic Material from Quantum Molecular Dynamics and the Molecular Structure Transition of β-HMX to δ-HMX,"We demonstrate the use of quantum molecular dynamics to identify the beta- to delta-molecular structure transition in bulk-phase HMX, which has been considered as the primary reason for the increased sensitivity in the thermal decomposition of HMX. Both physical and chemical changes accompany this transition, but no previous study has shown conclusively which specific change, or set of changes, is responsible. We find that the initial decomposition mechanism of HMX can explain this sensitivity issue. Our DFT simulations of the periodic system followed by detailed finite cluster calculations of the transition states find two distinct initial unimolecular reaction pathways in beta-HMX that operate simultaneously. (1) For the HONO release reaction, beta-HMX first transformed to an intermediate, in which one parallel N-NO2 group transitions from chair to boat conformations with a low +1.2 kcal/mol barrier, followed by unimolecular HONO release (+42.8 kcal/mol barrier, rate-determining step). (2) For the NO2 cleavage reaction, beta-HMX first transforms to the delta-HMX structure in two steps, with low barriers of +1.9 and +7.6 kcal/mol for each step, followed by unimolecular NO2 release (+31.3 kcal/mol barrier). Starting with delta-HMX, we find an initial unimolecular NO2 cleavage and then an independent HONO release reaction with the barriers of +31.6 kcal/mol (NO2 cleavage) and +38.9 kcal/mol (HONO release). We find that the constant proportional simulated initial structure transition temperature is 453 K, which is consistent with the experimental results (466 K).",2019
Meso-scale physical modeling of energetic degradation function in the nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage model for quasi-brittle materials,"The modeling of crack initiation and propagation is of vital importance in the design and safety evaluation of structural components and engineering structures. Great advances have been achieved in the crack simulation during the past decades. Although the phase-field theory and the newly proposed nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model can predict the crack initiation, propagation and load-deformation curves for quasi-brittle materials correctly, the energetic degradation function, which bridges the energy-based damage and the topologic damage and plays an important role in these models, is still more or less empirically determined. In the present paper, a physical interpretation and quantitative modeling of the energetic degradation function via the embedded meso-scale mechanism of damage in the NMMD model is proposed. For this purpose, the NMMD model is firstly outlined. In this model, the meso-scale damage is firstly defined based on the degradation of bonds of material point pairs according to the irreversible elongation. The macro-scale topologic damage is then evaluated by averaging the meso-scale damage in the influence domain. It is then inserted into the thermodynamically consistent framework of continuum damage mechanics via the energetic degradation function bridging the topologic damage and the energy-based damage. To physically determine the energetic degradation function, the Helmholtz free energy of the damaged and undamaged materials is evaluated from the meso-scale mechanism of damage In addition, it is theoretically proved that such determined energetic degradation function is invariant against the meso-scale parameters, including the radius of influence domain and the critical elongation quantity, and is weakly related to the strain state. Four numerical examples involving mode-I and mix-mode failures of isotropic quasi-brittle materials under static loading are studied to verify the NMMD model with the physically determined energetic degradation function. It is demonstrated that by the proposed approach there is no need to prescribe the initial crack and potential propagation path, the crack propagation can be captured automatically and the mesh size sensitivity is circumvented. Problems to be further studied are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2021

Silver and palladium nanoparticles-containing products of the low-temperature wave conversion of an energetic material: Catalytic activity in piperylene hydrogenation,"The hydrogenation of 1,3-pentadiene into pentenes over the commercial 0.5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and over a new catalyst containing 1.0% Pd and 3.7% Ag (mu-catalyst) has been investigated. The new catalyst has been prepared via the flameless wave conversion of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine in a porous composite. The catalytic properties of the new composite in the hydrogenation reaction depend on the hydrogen/1,3-pentadiene ratio and on the catalyst activation temperature. The reaction conditions for selective 1,3-pentadiene hydrogenation have been optimized. The pentenes yield as a function of temperature passes through a maximum at any H-2/C5H8 ratio between 1 and 2. The 2-pentene/1-pentene ratio in the reaction products increases as the temperature is raised.",2011
Reversibility of the Hydrogen Transfer in TKX-50 and Its Influence on Impact Sensitivity: An Exceptional Case from Common Energetic Materials,"Hydrogen transfer (HT) has been confirmed to possibly serve as a crucial step to initiate and control the decay of common energetic materials (EMs). Nevertheless, the case of currently thriving energetic ionic salts (EISs), as well as the difference in the HT influence on the properties and performances of common EMs and EISs, is poorly known. In this work, we carry out a comparative study of the HTs of dihydroxylammoniurn-5-5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) and beta-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazo cane (beta-HMX), as the candidates of EISs and common EMs, respectively, by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and climbing image nudged elastic band calculations, as well as powder Xray diffraction (PXRD) detections. As a result, the HT in TKX-50 is found to be significantly different from that in beta-HMX in many respects. The HT in TKX-50 can occur reversibly between the adjacent cations and anions as an intermolecular reaction. The HT is in fact a proton transfer and is energetically preferred as a first-step reaction with a relatively low energy barrier, instead of a rate-determining one for the entire decay of TKX-50. In comparison, with respect to HMX, the intermolecular HT unlikely takes place, while the intramolecular one, with a neutral H atom and a relatively high energy barrier, occurs as one of the possible rate-controlling steps toward the entire decomposition. More importantly, the reversible HT in TKX-50 implies a completely novel impact sensitivity mechanism for EMs; i.e., the external impact energy can partly be converted into the chemical energy stored first (when heating to approaching ignition) and dissipated by the chemical energy release subsequently (when cooling), which contributes to low impact sensitivity. This work provides an exception of a prior reaction favoring high impact safety of EMs, relative to those that mostly result in irreversible and disastrous consequences. Thus, this study hopefully extends the fields of both HT and EMs.",2017
Uncovering the Morphological Regulation Mechanism of Low Sensitivity and Highly Energetic Materials in Solvents: Changing Crystal Morphology Induced by Hydrogen Bonding,"Low sensitivity and highly energetic materials (LSHEMs) are currently the most promising high-energy materials due to their structural stability. However, many problems exist due to their abundant hydrogen bonding (HB) in the structure, such as low solubility and difficulty controlling the crystallization process. In this paper, aiming at regulating the crystal morphology of LSHEMs, 4,4',5,5'-tetranitro-1H,1'H-[2,2'-biimidazole]-1,1'-diamine is used as a model substance to explore the mechanism of controlling the crystal morphology in solvents. The molecular structure, crystal structure, and HB sites on crystal faces were investigated by molecular electrostatic potential surface, Hirshfeld surface, and HB analyses, and it was found that the HB density [delta(HB)] of faces is of the order (011) > (11-1) > (110) > (100) in crystal or solution, determining the tendency of interaction with polar solvents. Then, using molecular dynamics simulation and the modified attachment energy model, we found that the attachment energy of crystal faces and the predicted crystal morphologies in different solvents were determined by HB sites on faces and strongly correlated with the solvent polarity. The experimental morphologies were consistent with the trend predicted including the aspect ratio trend, which confirmed our theoretical speculation. This work provides an effective method of choosing solvents for morphology customization of LSHEMs, which will help guide the morphology control and realize the industry application of LSHEMs.",2022
"Green electrosynthesis of 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azofurazan energetic materials coupled with energy-efficient hydrogen production over Pt-based catalysts","The broad employment of clean hydrogen through water electrolysis is restricted by large voltage requirement and energy consumption because of the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here we demonstrate a novel alternative oxidation reaction of green electrosynthesis of valuable 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azofurazan energetic materials and coupled with hydrogen production. Such a strategy could greatly decrease the hazard from the traditional synthetic condition of 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azofurazan and achieve low-cell-voltage hydrogen production on WS2/Pt single-atom/nanoparticle catalyst. The assembled two-electrode electrolyzer could reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with ultralow cell voltages of 1.26 and 1.55 V and electricity consumption of only 3.01 and 3.70 kWh per m(3) of H-2 in contrast of the conventional water electrolysis (similar to 5 kWh per m(3)). Density functional theory calculations combine with experimental design decipher the synergistic effect in WS2/Pt for promoting Volmer-Tafel kinetic rate during alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, while the oxidative-coupling of starting materials driven by free radical could be the underlying mechanism during the synthesis of 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-azofurazan. This work provides a promising avenue for the concurrent electrosynthesis of energetic materials and low-energy-consumption hydrogen production.",2023
"Unrevealing the phase transition of high-performing high-nitrogen energetic material 1,5-diaminotetrazole-4: N-oxide via first-principles studies","The effect of pressure on crystal structures, electronic properties, hydrogen bonds, optical properties and me-chanical features of high-performing energetic material 1,5-diaminotetrazole-4: N-oxide was investigated by high-precision DFT-D method. The results reveal that there exists a critical point of phase transition around 8 GPa, reflected in various properties of the crystal. Band gap decreases gradually as the pressure increases, illustrating electrons are easier to transit from occupied orbit to the empty. The DOS analysis indicates that C-NH2, N-NH2 and N = O bonds may play a role as a reaction channel for the initial decomposition under high pressures. The hydrogen bond analysis indicates that pressure can alter the distribution of hydrogen bond in the crystal and modify the physicochemical properties. The absorption spectra of the crystal under high-pressure conditions show several strong bands in UV-visible region. The analysis on mechanical properties reveals that pressure can effectively improve the rigidity, plasticity and ductility for the crystal. Our results clarify the effect of pressure on energetic materials and are conducive to find the new crystalline phases for energetic materials.",2023
Taming Dinitramide Anions within an Energetic Metal-Organic Framework: A New Strategy for Synthesis and Tunable Properties of High Energy Materials,"Energetic polynitro anions, such as dinitramide ion [N(NO2)(2)(-)], have attracted significant interest in the field of energetic materials due to their high densities and rich oxygen contents; however, most of them usually suffer from low stability. Conveniently stabilizing energetic polynitro anions to develop new high energy materials as well as tuning their energetic properties still represent significant challenges. To address these challenges, we herein propose a novel strategy that energetic polynitro anions are encapsulated within energetic cationic metal organic frameworks (MOFs). We present N(NO2)(2)(-) encapsulated within a three-dimensional (3D) energetic cationic MOF through simple anion exchange. The resultant inclusion complex exhibits a remarkable thermal stability with the onset decomposition temperature of 221 degrees C, which is, to our knowledge, the highest value known for all dinitramide-based compounds. In addition, it possesses good energetic properties, which can be conveniently tuned by changing the mole ratio of the starting materials. The encapsulated anion can also be released in a controlled fashion without disrupting the framework. This work may shed new insights into the stabilization, storage, and release of labile energetic anions under ambient conditions, while providing a simple and convenient approach for the preparation of new energetic MOFs and the modulation of their energetic properties.",2016
Effect of addition of HTa to Al/PTFE under quasi-static compression on the properties of the developed energetic composite material,"To study the mechanical properties and reaction characteristics of Al/HTa/PTFE reactive materials under quasi-static compression, five types of Al/HTa/PTFE specimens with different HTa contents were prepared for quasi-static compression tests. The fracture of selected specimens was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quasi-static compression reaction residue underwent X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase analysis, and the chemical reaction mechanism was analyzed based on the result. As revealed from the results, the introduction of HTa significantly influenced the strength of the composites. With the increase in HTa content, the compressive strength of Al/HTa/PTFE materials first decreased and then increased. Under a HTa content of 30%, the compressive strength increased by nearly 10.6%. The microstructure shows that the HTa content in the Al/HTa/PTFE materials affects the bonding force between the metal particles and the PTFE matrix, the integrity of the PTFE matrix and the formation of PTFE bridging filaments between the deformed surfaces of the PTFE matrix, resulting in a difference in compressive strength. HTa increased the reaction duration and smoke concentration, and induced a similar white burning flame at the later phase of the reaction, with greater flame luminosity. The high temperature of the crack tip of the specimen induced the reaction of Al and PTFE and released considerable heat causing HTa to release H-2, synthesized TaC, and increased the energy density, which achieved the purpose of enhancing the mechanical properties and reaction characteristics of the material.",2021

"High dynamic range emission measurements of shocked energetic materials: Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX)","A new emission apparatus with high time resolution and high dynamic range was used to study shock-induced ignition of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine in the form of ultrafine powder (4 +/- 3 mu m particle size), over a range of impact velocities (0.8-4.3 km s(-1)) and impact durations (2.5-16 ns). A graybody model was used to extract graybody emissivities and time-dependent temperatures from a few ns to 100 mu s. The emission transients consisted of three parts: a 6700K nanosecond burst during the shocks, a 4000-4500K temperature spike near 0.3 mu s followed by a similar to 3300K tail extending out to similar to 100 mu s. These temperatures varied remarkably little with impact velocity and duration, while the emission intensities and emissivities changed by over an order of magnitude. The emissivity changes were interpreted with a hot spot model, where hot spot temperatures reached a maximum of 6700K and the hot spot volume fractions increased from 5% to 100% as impact velocity increased from 1 to 3 km s(-1). Changing shock durations in the 2.5-16 ns range had noticeable effects on the microsecond emission. The 0.3 mu s temperature spike was much smaller or absent with 2.5 ns shocks, but prominent with longer durations. An explanation for these effects was put forth that invoked the formation of carbon-rich clusters during the shock. In this view, cluster formation was minimal with 2.5 ns shocks, but longer-duration shocks produced increasingly larger clusters, and the 0.3 mu s temperature spikes represented cluster ignition.

"Bioaccumulation of chemical warfare agents, energetic materials, and metals in deep-sea shrimp from discarded military munitions sites off Pearl Harbor","The bioaccumulation of munitions-related chemicals at former military deep-water disposal sites is poorly understood. This paper presents the results of human-food-item biota sampling to assess the potential for bioaccumulation of chemical warfare agents, energetic materials, arsenic, and additional munitions-related metals in deep-sea shrimp tissue samples collected during the Hawaii Undersea Military Munitions Assessment (HUMMA) project to date. The HUMMA investigation area is located within a former munitions sea-disposal site located south of Pearl Harbor on the island of O'ahu, designated site Hawaii-05 (HI-05) by the United States Department of Defense. Indigenous deep-sea shrimp (Heterocarpus ensifer) were caught adjacent to discarded military munitions (DMM) and at control sites where munitions were absent. Tissue analysis results showed that chemical warfare agents and their degradation products were not present within the edible portions of these samples at detectable concentrations, and energetic materials and their degradation products were detected in only a few samples at concentrations below the laboratory reporting limits. Likewise, arsenic, copper, and lead concentrations were below the United States Food and Drug Administration's permitted concentrations of metals in marine biota tissue (if defined), and their presence within these samples could not be attributed to the presence of DMM within the study area based on a comparative analysis of munitions-adjacent and control samples collected. Based on this current dataset, it can be concluded that DMM existing within the HUMMA study area is not contributing to the bioaccumulation of munitions-related chemicals for the biota species investigated to date.

Recent Advances in the Study of the Initiation of Energetic Materials using Characteristics of Their Thermal Decomposition Part I. Cyclic Nitramines,"Arrhenius parameters, Ea and log A, of 17 cyclic nitramines, derived from the Russian vacuum manometric method (SMM) and compatible thermoanalytical methods, have been used in this study. The detonation velocity, D, at maximum theoretical crystal density, of the nitramines in this study was taken as a characteristic of their detonation. On the basis of known relationships between their E-a and D-2 values (modified Evans-Polanyi-Semenov equation), the specific influence of some physicochemical properties on their thermal decomposition was shown. A new logarithmic relationship was found between the rate constant k, of the unimolecular thermal decomposition of the nitramines studied at 230 degrees C, and their D values. A fundamental characteristic of this new relationship rests on the equivalency of the primary fission processes in the low-temperature thermal decomposition and on the detonation initiation of the nitramines understudy. Both these relationships confirm the problems encountered in the kinetic specification of the thermal decomposition of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW, CL-20) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX). These problems, and also the possible influence of the pre-decomposition states on the thermal decomposition of the nitramines studied, are discussed.",2014
Converting inert plastic waste into energetic materials: A study on the light-accelerated decomposition of plastic waste with the Fenton reaction,"Better treatment and management strategies than landfilling are needed to address the large quantities of unrecycled plastic waste generated by daily human activities. Waste-to-energy conversion is an ideal benchmark for developing future large-scale waste management technologies. The present study explores a new approach for producing energetic materials by converting inert plastic waste into energy (thermal and mechanical energies) via a light-controlled process through the simple chemical activation of plastic waste, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. The inert and non-polar polymer surfaces of the plastics were modified by generating a number of sulfonic groups (-SO3-) using chlorosulfuric acid, followed by grafting of Fe(III) catalyst onto the polymer chains to obtain activated polymer. Elemental analyses of these activated materials showed that the carbon-to-sulfur ratio ranged from 3:1 to 5:1. The FTIR spectra indicated the presence of C=C bonds (v(C=C): 1615-1630 cm(-1)) and S=O bonds (v(S=O): 1151-1167 cm(-1)) in the activated polymers after chemical reaction. These activated materials were energetic, as light could be used to convert them into thermal (1800-3200 J/g) and mechanical energies (380-560 kPa/g) using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant under ambient conditions within 1 h.

"Synthesis and characterization of 5-amino-1,3,6-trinitro-1","Two synthetic routes for the preparation of 5-amino-1,3,6-trinitro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one (2) as an energetic material have been revealed. Direct nitration of 5-amino-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one (1) gave the trinitrated compound 2 in a poor yield of 11%; and similarly using 1 as starting material, 2 was obtained by N-protected reaction, nitration, deprotection and again nitration reaction with an overall-yield of 48%. All structures of 2 and relevant compounds were determined by IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR spectroscopy, MS and elemental analysis. Theoretical calculations showed that the detonation properties of compound 2 (D = 7.78 km s(-1), P = 27.05 GPa) were satisfactory, compared with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT, D = 7.21 km s(-1), P = 22.49 GPa).",2014
Keeping the Same Ratio of the Ligand and Perchlorate: Realizing the High Performance of Energetic Materials by Changing the Bonding Mode,"In addition to the three classical methods for adjustingthe performanceof energetic complexes, in order to explore the influence of differentbonding types on the performance of energetic materials, we designedionic salts PZCA & BULL;HClO4 (3) and ECPs [Ag(PZCA)ClO4]( n ) (4) with PZCA(1H-pyrazole-4-carbohydrazide) as the ligand. They use thesame ligands and oxidizing acids and also have the same N/O number.On the basis of their structures and compositions confirmed by infraredspectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction,the characterization of physical and chemical properties shows that 4 has better thermal decomposition behavior (& UDelta;T = 30 & DEG;C), more suitable mechanical sensitivity (IS= 5 J, FS = 9 N), and more outstanding initiation performance. Afterstudying the decomposition mechanism, we find that different typesof bonds (H bond or coordination covalent bond) lead to differentdecomposition mechanisms (redox reaction or free radical reaction)and, finally, show great differences in explosive properties.",2023
Evaluation of the Appropriate Use of Characterization Methods for Differentiation between Cocrystals and Physical Mixtures in the Context of Energetic Materials,"Cocrystallization is an attractive method by which to tune the physical properties of energetic materials. However, in the absence of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), rigorously characterizing the results of cocrystallization attempts can be difficult. Specifically, differentiating between physical mixtures and true cocrystalline materials is challenging due to the propensity for energetic molecules to form solvates and/or polymorphs. The suitability and limitations of morphological analysis, vibrational (infrared and Raman) spectroscopy, and powder XRD are discussed within the context of six previously published materials claimed to be cocrystals but lacking SC-XRD structures. It was found that in all six cases the data originally published are consistent with crystallization of physical mixtures of the two starting components; in three of these cases the crystallization procedures were reproduced and the characterization data support the presence of physical mixtures. Data interpretation is convoluted by the presence of solvent/solvate formation or polymorphism in all six cases illustrating the ubiquity of the challenges faced in energetic cocrystal discovery.",2017
Thermal kinetic performance and storage life analysis of a series of high-energy and green energetic materials Metal perchlorates with carbohydrazide,"The thermal kinetic performance and storage life of tris(carbohydrazide) manganese(II) perchlorate (GTM), tris(carbohydrazide) nickel(II) perchlorate (GTN), tris(carbohydrazide) zinc(II) perchlorate (GTX), and tris(carbohydrazide) cadmium(II) perchlorate (GTG), as important high-energy and green materials, were carried out by the DSC, (thermogravimetric) TG, and a dynamic pressure measuring thermal analysis (DPTA) method. The thermal behavior, kinetics, thermal safety, and storage life of them were investigated. The results show that there are three mass-loss stages in TG curves, and one endothermic peak and two exothermic peaks in DSC curve for them. The first mass-loss stages are the melting processes, and the thermal decompositions have happened in this stage. The kinetic data were obtained from the DSC and TG curves by integral and differential methods. The most probable kinetic models and kinetic equations were suggested by polynomial fitting the kinetic data. The specific heat capacity was determined with theoretical calculation method, and then self-accelerating decomposition temperature (T-SADT), thermal ignition temperature (T-TIT), critical temperatures of thermal explosion (T-b), and the adiabatic time-to-explosion (t(TIAD)) are calculated, respectively. The storage lives of 0.01 % conversion rate for GTM, GTN, GTX, and GTG at 25 degrees C are 4.52a (annual), 9.26a 10.75a, and 7.57a. GTX is the most excellent carbohydrazide perchlorate.",2015
Residues from low-order energetic materials: The comparative performance of a range of sampling approaches prior to analysis by ion chromatography,"A quantitative study of common forensic evidence collection devices for the recovery of low-explosive residues from non-porous glass and plastic is presented herein. Swabbing materials including cotton, rayon, Nomex (R) (poly(isophthaloylchloride/m-phenylenediamine)), Teflon/Teflon-coated fibreglass (polytetrafluoroethylene) and adhesive-coated tapes were used to collect known quantities of up to 14 forensically relevant inorganic and organic anion and cation species from both surfaces. Analysis was performed using two validated ion chromatography methods. This study revealed that all swabs and surfaces contributed highly variable levels of interfering ionic species and that swabbing materials showed variance in the quantities and total number of analytes recovered from both surfaces. Teflon and Nomex (R) materials demonstrated the most promise due to their ability to collect and release analytes into simple extraction solvents as well as displaying relatively low endogenous interference. In parallel, the ability to extract residue directly from both surfaces via the addition of a suitable extraction solvent was investigated instead of swabbing. This work highlights that direct solvent extraction from a surface should be considered as an alternative approach, especially for small areas or objects. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive study of the efficiencies of sample collection technologies for low-explosive residues prior to analysis by ion chromatography.

Differential and Integral Isoconversional Non-linear Methods and Their Application to Energetic Materials. III. Non-isothermal Decomposition Reaction Kinetics of Benzotrifuroxan,"The thermal behaviour and decomposition reaction kinetics of benzotrifuroxan (BTF) were determined by TG and DSC techniques. The kinetic parameters of the exothermic decomposition reaction in a temperature programmed mode (the apparent activation energy E-a and pre-exponential factor A) were calculated by a single non-isothermal DSC curve. The E values calculated using the Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa equations and integral isoconversional non-linear equations were used to check the validity of activation energy by a single non-isothermal DSC curve. The results show that the kinetic model function in integral form and the values of E-a and A of the decomposition reaction of BTF are [-1n(1-alpha)](2/3), 109.95 kJ center dot mol(-1) and 10(8.16) s(-1), respectively.

"Autocatalytic decomposition of energetic materials: interplay of theory and thermal analysis in the study of 5-amino-3,4-dinitropyrazole thermolysis","A reliable kinetic description of the thermal stability of energetic materials (EM) is very important for safety and storage-related problems. Among other pertinent issues, autocatalysis very often complicates the decomposition kinetics of EM. In the present study, the kinetics and decomposition mechanism of a promising energetic compound, 5-amino-3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazole (5-ADP) were studied using a set of complementary experimental (e.g., differential scanning calorimetry in the solid state, melt, and solution along with advanced thermokinetic models, accelerating rate calorimetry, and evolved gas analysis) and theoretical techniques (CCSD(T)-F12 and DLPNO-CCSD(T) predictive quantum chemical calculations). The experimental study revealed that the strong acceleration of the decomposition rate of 5-ADP is caused by two factors: the progressive liquefaction of the sample directly observed using in situ optical microscopy, and the autocatalysis by reaction products. For the first time, the processing of the non-isothermal data was performed with a formal Manelis-Dubovitsky kinetic model that accounts for both factors. With the aid of quantum chemical calculations, we have rationalized the autocatalysis present in the formal kinetic models at the molecular level. Theory revealed an unusual primary decomposition channel of 5-ADP, viz., the two subsequent sigmatropic H-shifts in the pyrazole ring followed by the C-NO2 bond scission yielding a pyrazolyl and nitrogen dioxide radicals as simple primary products. Moreover, we found the secondary reactions of the latter radical with the 5-ADP to be kinetically unimportant. On the contrary, the substituted pyrazolyl radical turned out to undergo a facile addition to 5-ADP, followed by a fast exothermic elimination of another NO2 species. We believe the latter process to contribute remarkably to the observed autocatalytic behavior of 5-ADP. Most importantly, the calculations provide detailed mechanistic evidence complementing the thermoanalytical experiment and formal kinetic models.",2022
"1-Amine-1,2,3-triazolium salts with oxidizing anions: A new family of energetic materials with good performance","A series of 1-amino-1,2,3-triazole (ATZ) based energetic nitrogen-rich salts are prepared by using acid-base neutralization reaction (1:1 M ratio), and fully characterized. Structures of the salts are recrystallized and determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which dominated by a strong hydrogen-bond influence with the densities ranging from 1.692 to 1.868 g cm(-3). Thermal behaviors have characterized by using the DSC and TG-DTG technologies. The enthalpies of formation have calculated by using Gaussian 03. The detonation parameters of the salts are determined by using the K-J method, and most salts show promising detonation performances (D: 6699-8231 m s(-1), P: 19.2-30.7 GPa), among which the salt of 1-amino-1,2,3-triazolium trinitrophloroglucinate has a detonation properties comparable to RDX.

"Conversion of aromatic amines and N-aromatic amides to O-aromatic esters, biphenyls, aromatic halides and energetic materials via nitrosamide intermediates","The conversion of aromatic amines to esters and phenols is a very useful transformation typically carried out using diazonium salt intermediates but the yields and product purity are highly variable. Aliphatic primary amides can be converted to esters via the corresponding N-nitrosamides but the reaction is of little utility. Little is known about the analogous reaction of primary amides derived from aromatic amines. It has been discovered that the reaction of aromatic amides with nitrite in a solution of acetic anhydride and acetic acid gives the corresponding esters in good to excellent yields. This reaction is functional group tolerant. Acetanilides, trifluoroacetanilides, and benzanilides gave the corresponding acetates, trifluoroacetates, and benzoates. These esters can be converted to the corresponding phenols easily and quantitatively. Formation of biphenyls though aromatic nitrosamides have been observed in the past but the nitrosamide either had to be synthesized under harsh conditions, or isolated first. It has been discovered that the introduction of a reactive solvent, methyl methacrylate, into this reaction sequence developed for the formation of esters resulted in polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Changing the reactive solvent to benzene has allowed the formation of biaryls under mild conditions without isolating the aromatic nitrosamide. In some cases, when benzoic acid is added to the reaction, deamination has occurred. In one case, with 1,8-bis(N-acetamido)naphthalene, when benzoic acid was added to the reaction the formation of perylene occurred. The introduction of halogens into aromatic compounds is an important synthetic procedure. Some of the present methods, in use today, require harsh conditions, provide a mixture of usually ortho or para halogenated products, or provide variable yields ranging from poor to excellent, depending on the substituent attached to the aromatic ring and/or the conditions the reaction is carried out. It has been discovered that the introduction of a suitable halogen source into the reaction sequence will allow the conversion of the aromatic secondary amides to aromatic halides in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. These reactions can be carried out directly on aromatic amines (initial in situ acetanilide formation) to give aromatic acetates, and halides in good to excellent isolated yields. The mechanism, scope, potential utility of these reaction as well as the use of the nitrosamide as an initiator for polymerization reactions will be discussed in this dissertation.",2002

Construction of an Unusual Two-Dimensional Layered Structure for Fused-Ring Energetic Materials with High Energy and Good Stability,"The creation of high-performance energetic materials with good mechanical sensitivities has been a great challenge over the past decades, since such materials have huge amounts of energy and are thus essentially unstable. Here, we report on a promising fused-ring energetic material with an unusual two-dimensional (2D) structure, 4-nitro-7-azido-pyrazol-[3,4-d]-1,2,3-triazine-2-oxide (NAPTO), whose unique 2D structure has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Experimental studies show that this novel energetic compound has remarkably high energy (detonation velocity D = 9.12 km.s(-1); detonation pressure P = 35.1 GPa), excellent sensitivities toward external stimuli (impact sensitivity IS = 18 J; friction sensitivity FS = 325 N; electrostatic discharge sensitivity EDS = 0.32 J) and a high thermal decomposition temperature (203.2 degrees C), thus possessing the dual advantages of high energy and low mechanical sensitivities. To our knowledge, NAPTO is the first fused-ring energetic material with 2D layered crystal stacking. The stabilization mechanism toward external stimuli were investigated using molecular simulations, and the theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the ultraflat 2D layered structure can buffer external mechanical stimuli more effectively than other structures by converting the mechanical energy acting on the material into layer sliding and compression. Our study reveals the great promise of the fused-ring 2D layered structure for creating advanced energetic materials. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Steric and energetic investigations of adsorption isotherms of methylene blue on new polymeric multi-layered material-based k-carrageenan and alginate,"In this research study, we examined the adsorption behavior of methylene blue (MB) on a novel biosorbent made of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) biopolymeric material at three different temperatures. Various models derived from statistical physics formalism were employed to analyze the adsorption isotherms. An alternative approach based on the application of multilayer models from statistical physics theory was used to better investigate the adsorption mechanisms of MB on the PEM grafting material. We adjusted various parameters within this model across temperatures of 295K, 313 K, and 333 K, and these parameters played a crucial role in comprehending the adsorption mechanism. In addition, this approach revealed that the MB dye is linked through a multilayer process on the PEM grafting material with 'non-parallel' configurations and multimolecular process. The PEM grafting material showed maximum adsorption capacities ranging from 632.23 mg/g to 463.76 mg/g for the removal of MB over a pH of 6. The calculated adsorption energies ranged from 11.6 to 18.65 kJ/cool, indicating that the MB adsorption process was primarily of a physisorption nature influenced by both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Thus, the theoretical analysis indicated that this low-cost adsorbent material (PEM grafting) is a promising material for the removal of MB dye from the solution. Additionally, we examined the adsorption behavior by calculating the entropy, the free energy and the internal energy which govern the adsorption process of MB onto the PEM grafting material.",2024
Modeling and analysis of hygroscopicity of energetic materials under various temperature and relative humidity conditions: A case study on ammonium nitrate,"Ammonium nitrate (AN) is widely used in agriculture, explosives and propellants, but its strong hygroscopicity limits its further application. In this paper, a novel water vapor modeling method is proposed to evaluate the hygroscopicity of AN particle under various temperature and relative humidity (RH) environments. Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the intermolecular interactions during the moisture absorption process. The simulation results demonstrate that the hygroscopicity of AN exhibits an increasing trend with both temperature and RH, and electrostatic force is the main reason for hygroscopicity. Moreover, the influence of temperature on hygroscopicity is found to be more significant compared to RH. Combining experiments and simulations, a mathematical formula has been developed for rapidly comparing the hygroscopicity of AN in specific environments. This method demonstrates simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy, enabling assessment of the hygroscopic performance of AN (or modified AN) across a broad spectrum of temperature and RH conditions.",2024
"Radical-mediated C-N bond activation in 3,5-diamino-4-nitro-1","C-N bond activation has been recognized as a powerful methodology in organic synthesis, but C-N bond activation on monocyclic rings remains an intractable challenge, due to the high energy barrier required for the dearomatization process. Now a facile and efficient nitrogen-centered-radical-mediated approach to cleave C-N bonds in a monocyclic pyrazole is described. Using N-bromosuccinimide as a radical initiator, C-N bond cleavage was achieved in yields up to 91%. This reaction Led to an important precursor (2), subsequently annulated and oxidized to an energetic compound 4, which exhibits promising application in balancing performances and thermal stabilities.",2022
"1,3,5-Triiodo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TITNB) from benzene: Balancing performance and high thermal stability of functional energetic materials","In order to deal with biohazards from nature or biological weapons, it is urgent and necessary to develop functional energetic materials as an ingredient of agent defeat weapons (ADWs). Now, 1,3,5-triiodo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TITNB, 1) was obtained from benzene by an easy two-step reaction. The structure of 1 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 has a remarkable experimental density of 3.05 g cm(-3) at room temperature and a good detonation performance. In addition, it contains 64.44% iodine and has a high decomposition temperature of 367 degrees C. These fascinating properties make it very attractive for high performance applications such as agent defeat weapons (ADWs).",2019
1-Amino-5-nitriminotetrazole: Effective Interaction of N-Nitro and N-Amino Functionalities for Outperforming and Applicable Energetic Materials,"1-Amino-5-nitriminotetrazole is synthesized for the first time via acid-catalyzed protection of 1,5-diaminotetrazole with acetone followed by aprotic nitration using N2O5 and in situ deprotection. The salts of 1-amino-5-nitriminotetrazolate are synthesized by addition of the corresponding bases. Most of the nitrogen-rich salts show insane explosive properties and compete with the most powerful non-nuclear explosives. The implementation of a fused triazolium cation yields a promising secondary explosive, with high performance but also low sensitivity and high thermal stability. Metal salts (K and Ag) are successfully used to initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate using a classical detonator setup.",
Unusual Cu-Co/GO Composite with Special High Organic Content Synthesized by an ,"An interesting Cu-Co/GO composite with special high organic content was accidentally fabricated for the first time via a one-pot solvothermal method in the mixed solvent of isopropanol and glycerol. The Cu-Co/GO composite was calcined separately in three different atmospheres (air, nitrogen, and argon) and further investigated by a series of characterization techniques. The results indicate that the spinel phase nano-CuCo2O4 composite, nanometal oxides (CuO and CoO), and nanometal mixture of Cu and Co were unexpectedly formed after calcination in air, N-2, and Ar atmospheres, respectively, and the possible reaction mechanism was discussed. The specific mass losses of the Cu-Co/GO composite calcined in air, N-2, and Ar atmospheres were 28.14 %, 21.68 %, and 23.76 %, respectively. The catalytic decomposition performances of the as-prepared samples for cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and the mixture of nitrocellulose (NC) and RDX (NC + RDX) were investigated and compared via DSC method, and the results demonstrate that Cu-Co/GO composites obviously decrease the thermal decomposition temperature of RDX from 242.3 to 236.5 (before calcination), 238.6 (air), 235.8 (N-2), and 228.6 degrees C (Ar), respectively. Cu-Co/GO(Ar) composite exhibits the best catalytic decomposition performance among all samples, which makes the decomposition temperature of RDX and NC + RDX decrease by 13.7 and 4.9 degrees C and the apparent activation energy of decomposition for RDX decrease by 110.1 kJ/mol. The enhanced catalytic performance of Cu-Co/GO(Ar) composite could be attributed to the smaller particle size, better crystallinity, and specific well-dispersed metal atoms, whereas the Cu-Co/GO(air) composite after air calcination presents a bad catalytic performance due to the removal of GO.",2020
Tailoring Vibrational Signature and Functionality of 2D-Ordered Linear-Chain Carbon-Based Nanocarriers for Predictive Performance Enhancement of High-End Energetic Materials,"A recently proposed, game-changing transformative energetics concept based on predictive synthesis and preprocessing at the nanoscale is considered as a pathway towards the development of the next generation of high-end nanoenergetic materials for future multimode solid propulsion systems and deep-space-capable small satellites. As a new door for the further performance enhancement of transformative energetic materials, we propose the predictive ion-assisted pulse-plasma-driven assembling of the various carbon-based allotropes, used as catalytic nanoadditives, by the 2D-ordered linear-chained carbon-based multicavity nanomatrices serving as functionalizing nanocarriers of multiple heteroatom clusters. The vacant functional nanocavities of the nanomatrices available for heteroatom doping, including various catalytic nanoagents, promote heat transfer enhancement within the reaction zones. We propose the innovative concept of fine-tuning the vibrational signatures, functionalities and nanoarchitectures of the mentioned nanocarriers by using the surface acoustic waves-assisted micro/nanomanipulation by the pulse-plasma growth zone combined with the data-driven carbon nanomaterials genome approach, which is a deep materials informatics-based toolkit belonging to the fourth scientific paradigm. For the predictive manipulation by the micro- and mesoscale, and the spatial distribution of the induction and energy release domains in the reaction zones, we propose the activation of the functionalizing nanocarriers, assembled by the heteroatom clusters, through the earlier proposed plasma-acoustic coupling-based technique, as well as by the Teslaphoresis force field, thus inducing the directed self-assembly of the mentioned nanocarbon-based additives and nanocarriers.",2022
"Polymorph-Dependent Initial Thermal Decay Mechanism of Energetic Materials: A Case of 1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-Tetrazocane","Polymorphism is universal in energetic materials (EMs), and polymorphic transition may lead to variations of structure and performance. This work exemplifies such variations by revealing the polymorph-dependent mechanism of initial thermal decomposition of a typical EM, 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), using density functional tight-binding molecular dynamics simulations. This polymorphic dependence is reflected by the differences in starting steps and their weights and the evolutions of potential energy, reactants, and some important intermediates and products. Our simulations show that delta-HMX, thermally transitioned from alpha- or beta-HMX, possesses the lowest thermostability; the C-N cleavage and the NO2 partition initiate the thermal decomposition of all three polymorphs, and their weights increase and reduce with the increasing temperature; and the intermediate-initiated thermal decomposition of the HMX molecules occurs only in the beta-formed polymorph. The polymorphic dependence is originated from the differences of molecular conformers and stacking mode of different polymorphs, which further result in the differences in internal energy, intermolecular contact, and intermolecular reaction. This work presents a molecular insight into the polymorph-dependent thermal decomposition mechanism and exemplifies the importance of thinking highly of the structure transitioned, instead of the most stable structure under common conditions only.",2021
Synthesis and properties of transition metal coordination energetic materials based on a versatile and multifunctional 1-Aminotetrazol-5-one ligand,"New energetic transition metal (Co, Cu, Zn, and Cd) coordination compounds (CCs) based on versatile and multifunctional 1-amino-tetrazol-5-one ligand were prepared by using a facile strategy. All the synthesized CCs were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. They crystallize in common space groups with high densities in the range of 2.246 to 2.598 g.cm(-3) and their onset decomposition temperatures were found in the range of 292.C (CC1) to 327. C (CC3). Further investigations revealed that in addition to the coordination bonds the strong hydrogen bond interactions also exist, which ultimately decided the crystal structure engineering and physical properties of the resultant CCs. The mechanical sensitivities towards impact and friction were evaluated using standard methods and as a result, the energetic metal CCs are were classified as insensitive. The flame test of these energetic metal CCs showed a range of characteristic flame colors from light blue to blue-green except for the cadmium coordination compound, which indicates colorless flame. Hence, the insensitivities of these CCs towards impact and friction as well as characteristic flame colors support their potential use as insensitive energetic materials or pyrotechnics.",2021
"Pressure-induced physical and chemical changes of non-conventional energetic materials: Nitrate, perchlorate and peroxide chemistries at high pressures and high temperatures","Non-conventional explosives are widely used in terrorist activities, thus imposing a threat to homeland security. The simple combination of oxidizers with fuels is one popular category. Our goal is to explore and understand chemistry in selected oxidizers over a relevant pressure-temperature (P-T) regime of blast conditions, to get insights into fundamental chemistry associated with the selected energetic molecules and energetic processes at molecular level, for mitigation applications. We have investigated ammonium nitrate (AN), ammonium perchlorate (AP), and simple group IA peroxides under high-pressure high-temperature conditions, using confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction. AN studies conducted up to 50 GPa and 450 °C provide new constraints for its phase diagram. The spectral evidence confirms the presence of phase IV´ in a wide range of both thermal and chemical conditions. The strengthening of hydrogen bonding observed for phase IV´ influences the melt-decomposition line, showing an unusual turnover of decomposition temperature. We have proposed two models for decomposition, based on the phase from which it occurs. In addition, we observed an enhanced stability for phase IV in different chemical environments. AP studies conducted up to 50 GPa and 450 °C show spectral evidence for three new ordered phases (III, IV and VI) at various P-T conditions with varying degrees of hydrogen bonding. Decomposition occurs from phase V which we suggest to be initiated via a diffusion pathway. The proposed phase diagram shows a rich polymorphism and replacement of melt from a decomposition line. Both Li 2 O 2 and Na 2 O 2 studies show evidence for pressure-induced phase and chemical transitions, similar to H 2 O 2 . We observed comparatively higher transition pressures for both phase I → II and chemical decomposition transitions in Li 2 O 2 . This suggests the influence of the degree of intermolecular interactions on transition pressures. The orthorhombic Li 2 O 2 phase II with enhanced stability is a structure with different packing. Unlike nitrates and perchlorates, alkali metal peroxides are the only type of oxidizers considered in this study in which hydrogen bonding is absent. Our results show that both the presence of hydrogen bonding and its degree have varying effects on their decomposition mechanisms and transition pressures and temperatures.",2015
"Investigation of linear and nonlinear optical properties of 3, 6-bis pyridine-1, 2, 4, 5-tetrazine: a high nitrogen-energetic material","Of late, high-nitrogen energetic materials have garnered a lot of attention among researchers as they contribute to amplifying the progress of research and applications such that they typically leave a lasting impression which leads to significant scientific growth. 1,2,4,5-tetrazine and its 3,6-disubstituted derivatives continue to make inroads which pave the way for applications of diverse nature. On these lines, the organic compound of 3,6-bis Pyridine-1,2,4,5 - Tetrazine (BPTZ) has been preferred for the present investigation such that its synthesis and the basic characterizations of NMR, XRD and elemental analyses have been carried out. The required vibrational studies have been accomplished by employing FTIR as well as Raman spectroscopic analyses. The structure of BPTZ has been obtained theoretically by carrying out DFT/B3LYP calculations with the implementation of B3LYP/ 6-311G** basis set. Hyper Rayleigh scattering analysis has been accomplished and the first hyperpolarizability (b) of the title compound has been also computed making use of the technique of second harmonic light scattering (SHLS). The efficiency of SHG for BPTZ is 0.65 times greater than the standard KDP. BPTZ are excellent materials that make way for the development of their electrofluorochromism (EF) and the creation of electrofluorochromic as well as optoelectronic devices.",
"Synthesis, characterization and properties of nitrogen-rich compounds based on cyanuric acid: a promising design in the development of new energetic materials","Nitrogen-rich compounds such as ammonium (1), hydrazinium (2), aminoguanidinium (3), diaminoguanidinium (4), triaminoguanidinium (5), aminonitroguanidinium (6), aminocarbonylguanidinium (7), and metforminium (8), based on a nitrogen-rich anion [CA(-) (N% = 32.55%, CA = cyanuric acid) and co-crystal 5-amino-1H-tetrazole based on CA (9) were synthesized by means of metathesis reactions. The crystal structures of compounds 2, 4, and 9 center dot H2O were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and fully characterized by UV-vis, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, MS and elemental analysis. The thermal stabilities were investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The DTA results show that all compounds exhibit high thermal stabilities. Additionally, the heats of formation were calculated by using the B3LYP functional with the 6-311++G** basis set and a Born-Haber energy cycle. Theoretical calculations provided detonation pressures and velocities of the energetic salts within the range of 16.88-30.71 GPa and 6276.5-8392.1 m s(-1), respectively. Impact sensitivities of the compounds were determined by the Fall hammer test. All compounds show insensitive impact sensitivities of >60 J, which are better than those of TATB (50 J).",2016
Combination of Energetic Tetrazole and Triazole: Promising Materials with Exceptional Stability and Low Mechanical Sensitivity as Propellants and Gas Generators,": An innovative synthesis of 5-((1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl)-4H-1,2,4triazole-3,4-diamine (TMT) based on triazole and tetrazole frameworks bearing double amino groups was reported. It is worth mentioning that TMT is insensitive to impact and friction (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N), thus enabling it to have an exceptional thermal decomposition behavior that is superior to RDX and TNT. Meanwhile, it also has relatively high energetic performance (Dv = 8.417 km/s). A series of energycontaining salts TMT-1-8 were also investigated for their potential applications. Except for TMT-4 and TMT-7, the remaining nitrogen-rich salts have initial decomposition temperatures above 200 degrees C. Furthermore, the salts with positive heat generation all have extraordinary gas production, especially for TMT-1 (Vo = 840.5 dm3/kg), TMT-2 (Vo = 803.9 dm3/kg), and TMT-7 (Vo = 844.3 dm3/kg). The low mechanical sensitivities of the TMT series were discovered, and a majority of them have impact sensitivities exceeding 40 J with friction sensitivities exceeding 360 N which are superior to TNT (IS = 15 J, FS = 353 N). The intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the crystals TMT-1-3 were explored by Hirshfeld surfaces, 2D fingerprint plots, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis, and electrostatic potential surface analysis to understand the physicochemical property changes in relation to the structure. Consequently, this novel tri/tetrazole and polyamine system as a promising material provides the impetus for the development of gas generators and propellants.",2023

The kinetics of the beta -> alpha PT in DADNE is investigated by infrared spectrophotometry. The alpha -> beta phase transition is described by the first-order autocatalysis equation.

"Excited electronic state decomposition of furazan based energetic materials:: 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-azoxyfurazan and its model systems, diaminofurazan and furazan","We report the first experimental and theoretical study of gas phase excited electronic state decomposition of a furazan based, high nitrogen content energetic material, 3,3(')-diamino-4,4(')-azoxyfurazan (DAAF), and its model systems, diaminofurazan (DAF) and furazan (C2H2N2O). DAAF has received major attention as an insensitive high energy explosive; however, the mechanism and dynamics of the decomposition of this material are not clear yet. In order to understand the initial decomposition mechanism of DAAF and those of its model systems, nanosecond energy resolved and femtosecond time resolved spectroscopies and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations have been employed to investigate the excited electronic state decomposition of these materials. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from DAAF and its model systems at three UV excitation wavelengths (226, 236, and 248 nm) with a pulse duration of 8 ns. Energies of the three excitation wavelengths coincide with the (0-0), (0-1), and (0-2) vibronic bands of the NO A (2)Sigma(+)<- X (2)Pi electronic transition, respectively. A unique excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for DAAF, which generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (20 K) and a vibrationally hot (1265 K) distribution. On the contrary, excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels are observed for the model systems, which generate the NO product with both rotationally cold and hot distributions depending on the excitation wavelengths. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF level of theory illustrates that two conical intersections between the excited and ground electronic states are involved in two different excitation wavelength dependent dissociation channels for the model systems. Femtosecond pump-probe experiments at 226 nm reveal that the NO molecule is still the main observed decomposition product from the materials of interest and that the formation dynamics of the NO product is faster than 180 fs. Two additional fragments are observed from furazan with mass of 40 amu (C2H2N) and 28 amu (CH2N) employing femtosecond laser ionization. This observation suggests a five-membered heterocyclic furazan ring opening mechanism with rupture of a CN and a NO bond, yielding NO as a major decomposition product. NH2 is not observed as a secondary decomposition product of DAAF and DAF. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.",2008
Reaction mechanism and electronic properties of host-guest energetic material CL-20/HA under high pressure by quantum-based molecular dynamics simulations,"The novel host-guest material 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20)/hydroxylamine (HA) improves the detonation energy of CL-20 explosives without compromising its safety. However, the reaction mechanism of CL-20/HA under high pressure is not yet fully understood for the complex host-guest structure. A multiscale shock simulation technique by quantum-based molecular dynamics was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of CL-20/HA under shock with different velocities along different directions, focusing on charge transfer, electronic properties, reaction path and product evolution. The structural changes caused by both insertion of HA and charge overlap between CL-20 and HA are responsible for the electronic changes and gap decrease. Directional charge transfer was observed between CL-20 and HA molecular fragments during shock in all shock loading directions, causing the CL-20 molecular group to become electrically non-neutral. The C-N bond in the CL-20 cage then broke, leading to the release of nitro and nitrous oxide at high temperatures and pressures. The HA molecules or free H atoms from HA could bond with the O atom in the nitro group, leading to the N-O bond cleavage. Some free H atoms could act as an intermediary, connecting two CL-20 molecules and forming dimeric molecules briefly. Compared with the pure CL-20 system, HA can inhibit the reaction of CL-20 in the CL-20/HA system to some extent during the initial shock stage. A further understanding of the chemical reaction mechanism and energy release in dense host-guest materials can be advanced by focusing on the microscopic internal effects of the guest molecule on the host molecule reactions.",2023
"The light/impact sensitive orientations of energetic material dihydroxyl ammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50) from first-principles calculations","Dihydroxyl ammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) is a newly explosive material attracting researchers, but the sensitive orientation is out of research in theory. First-principles calculated phonons and electrons are attempted to find the sensitive orientation of TKX-50 and of its derivatives. To discuss the sensitive degree of electrons, the bandgap and effective mass are calculated from electron density states. The phonons are calculated from dynamic matrix to discuss the sensitively vibrational orientation of bonds, revealing the optically sensitive directions in [1 0 0] and [0 1 0]. Also, the mechanical properties are listed from elastic constants to show the resistances to deformation corresponding to the sensitivity under impact.",2020
"Benzofuroxan (Benzo[1,2-c]1,2,5-oxadiazole ","The objective of this work was to prepare benzofuroxan derivatives as new, dense, potentially energetic materials and to investigate their properties, with the main focus being on 5,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan (5,6-DNBF). 5,6-DNBF was prepared by a 3-step reaction sequence: a) 1-azido-3-nitrobenzene was synthesized by diazotation of 3-nitroaniline with sodium nitrite and subsequent reaction with sodium azide in acetic/sulfuric mixed acids; b) it was nitrated with HNO3/H2SO4 to 1-azido-2,4,5-trinitrobenzene; c) thermal cyclization of the latter compound in a polar solvent gave the desired 5,6-DNBF (m.p. 177 degrees C). It was fully characterized by UV/VIS, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The density of the compound (X-ray) was found to be comparatively high (1.88 g/cm(3)), and to be superior to the previously known, isomeric energetic material 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan (4,6-DNBF) (1.76 g/cm(3)). Furthermore, the synthesis of some other benzofuroxan derivatives, potentially interesting as high energy, density materials (HEDMs), has been carried out. The densities of the compounds obtained were calculated using ACD Labs software (version 4.0). Based on the results obtained, it could be concluded that 5,6-DNBF is one of the densest nitro derivatives of the benzofuroxan series, comparable to CL-14, CL-17, CL-18, and thus could have potential applications as an HEDM.",2012
"Effect of pressure on the vibrational structure of insensitive energetic material 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazole-3-one.","The Raman spectra of alpha form 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazole-3-one (alpha-NTO, space group P) were measured in a high-pressure vessel diamond anvil cell (DAC). The pressure was increased to 27.6 GPa. In general, Raman bands show a blue shift because of the nature of the molecule packing as a high-pressure effect, but some particular bands exhibited a red shift, disappearance, split, or slight shifting in our experiments. Those red-shifting bands concerning hydrogen bonds, i.e., carbonyl and amino groups, are likely to work as a stabilizer against stimuli to the molecule or crystal. This stabilizing nature might characterize the insensitivity of NTO. Molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were performed to reveal the high-pressure effect of the alpha-NTO crystal. The coordinates of individual atoms in the crystal structure were obtained using X-ray diffraction analysis. The pressure dependence of the power spectra of the correlation functions of the C=O bond length in NTO was calculated. A unique high-pressure effect of the alpha-NTO crystal was found on the power spectra. The peak frequency in the power spectrum of the C=O stretching vibration exhibited a red shift with an increase in pressure to 10.0 GPa, while the peak intensity considerably decreased under the same pressure process, because this bond length increased with an increase in pressure to 10.0 GPa. At a pressure of >20.0 GPa, a blue shift appeared. These results of the MD calculations are in good agreement with our experimental data.",g-17
"Synthesis and Study of Steering of Azido-tetrazole Behavior in Tetrazolo[1,5-","Tetrazoles and their derivatives are essential for compound synthesis due to their versatility, effectiveness, stability in air, and cost-efficiency. This has stimulated interest in developing techniques for their production. In this work, four compounds, tetrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5-amine (1), N-(4-azidopyrimidin-2-yl)nitramide (2), tetrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5(6H)-one (3), and tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5-amine (4), were obtained from commercially available reagents and straightforward synthetic methodologies. These new compounds were characterized by infrared (IR), C-13, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The solvent, temperature, and electron-donating group (EDG) factors that were responsible for the steering of azido-tetrazole equilibrium in all compounds were also studied. In addition, the detonation performance of the target compounds was calculated by using heats of formation (HOFs) and crystal densities. Hirshfeld surface analysis was used to examine the intermolecular interactions of the four synthesized compounds. The results show that the excellent properties of 1-4 are triggered by ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and pi-pi stacking interactions, indicating that these compounds have the potential to be used in the development of high-performance energetic materials. Additionally, DFT analysis is in support of experimental results, which proved the effect of different factors that can influence the azido-tetrazole equilibrium in the synthesized pyrimidine derivatives in the solution.",2024
Intramolecular Connections of Tetrazoles with ,"To date, there have been few reports on fused tricyclic compounds in the field of energetic materials. To take full advantage of the high heat of formation of tetrazoles (334 kJ mol(-1)), a series of fused [5,6,5]- and [5,7,5]-tricyclic energetic compounds were synthesized by using 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,3-dibromopropane, and bromo(bromomethoxy)methane for intramolecular connections with bistetrazoles. In this study, the heat resistance of H2BTD (T-d = 318 degrees C) is the same as that of conventional heat-resistant explosive HNS (T-d = 318 degrees C). However, the fused tricyclic energetic compounds H2BTP (V-D = 8025 m s), H2BTD) (V-D = 7750 m s(-1)), and H2BTO (V-D = 8146 m s(-1)) exhibit higher detonation velocities than those of HNS (V-D = 7612 m s(-1)), making them potentially interesting candidates for further research into new heat-resistant explosives. The successful construction of fused [5,6,5]- and [5,7,5]-tricyclic compounds provides an effective guide for the future design of novel HEDMs.",2023
"Introduction of the acylamino group to bridged bis(nitroamino-1,2,4-triazole): a strategy for tuning the sensitivity of energetic materials","In this work, the acylamino group has been introduced into energetic materials to build acylaminobridged bis(1,2,4-triazole) 3 and its nitration derivative 4. Both 3 and 4 were thoroughly characterized via spectroscopic and structural methods. In addition, their sensitivities toward friction and impact were determined and the energetic performances of 3 and 4 were calculated using the EXPLO5 code. Compound 3 is insensitive to mechanical stimulation (IS: 40 J, FS: 320 N).

"The Chemistry and Properties of Energetic Materials Bearing [1,2,4]Triazolo[4,3-","Treatment of heterocyclic amines featuring fused rings of [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazine with fuming HNO3/P2O5 leads to six fully characterized explosives through multiple nitration and reduction or oxidation mechanism. Thus, 4-nitro-N-(3-nitro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazin-6-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-amine (3 b, TTDNF) showed high performance (D=9180 m s(-1), P=36.7 GPa) and low impact sensitivity (IS>40 J) while N-([1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazin-6-yl)-3-nitro-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-amine (4 a, TTNOA) exhibited a potential cast explosive component with low melting point at 88.2 degrees C and high onset decomposition temperature at 226.2 degrees C.",2018

The application of the very straightforward and efficient acetyl protection of 3,5-diamino-1H-1,2,4-triazole allows selective reactions of the remaining free amino group to form the azo-functionality. Compound 3 is used as starting material for the synthesis of 5,5'-dinitrimino-3,3'-azo-1H-1,2,4-triazole (4), which subsequently reacted with organic bases (ammonia, hydrazine, guanidine, aminoguanidine, triaminoguanidine) to form the corresponding nitrogen-rich triazolate salts (5-9). All substances were fully characterized by IR and Raman as well as multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Selected compounds were additionally characterized by low temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements.

Synthesis of 5-Aminotetrazole-1N-oxide and Its Azo Derivative: A Key Step in the Development of New Energetic Materials,"1-Hydroxy-5-aminotetrazole (1), which is a long-desired starting material for the synthesis of hundreds of new energetic materials, was synthesized for the first time by the reaction of aqueous hydroxylamine with cyanogen azide. The use of this unique precursor was demonstrated by the preparation of several energetic compounds with equal or higher performance than that of commonly used explosives, such as hexogen (RDX). The prepared compounds, including energetic salts of 1-hydroxy-5-aminotetrazole (hydroxylammonium (2, two polymorphs) and ammonium (3)), azo-coupled derivatives (potassium (5), hydroxylammonium (6), ammonium (7), and hydrazinium 5,5-azo-bis(1-N-oxidotetrazolate (8, two polymorphs)), as well as neutral compounds 5,5-azo-bis(1-oxidotetrazole) (4) and 5,5-bis(1-oxidotetrazole)hydrazine (9), were intensively characterized by low-temperature X-ray diffraction, IR, Raman, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and DSC. The calculated energetic performance, by using the EXPLO5 code, based on the calculated (CBS-4M) heats of formation and X-ray densities confirm the high energetic performance of tetrazole-N-oxides as energetic materials. Last but not least, their sensitivity towards impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge were explored. 5,5-Azo-bis(1-N-oxidotetrazole) deflagrates close to the DDT (deflagration-to-detonation transition) faster than all compounds that have been investigated in our research group to date.",2013
"Synthesis, structure and properties of neutral energetic materials based on ","3,6-Dinitropyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrazole (DNPP, 4) was prepared using an efficient modification process. Various neutral energetic derivatives of DNPP were synthesized from N-functionalization of imide (NH) group. All compounds were fully characterized by H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Hunting for advanced high-energy-density materials with well-balanced energy and safety through an energetic host-guest inclusion strategy,"In the development of advanced high-energy-density materials (HEDMs), the traditional strategy of integrating oxidant and fuel components into an organic molecule makes it very difficult to balance the energy and safety of materials. Herein, we present an intermolecular host-guest inclusion strategy for constructing advanced HEDMs with well-balanced energy and safety. By gradually introducing high-energy oxidants into the supramolecular voids of the deliberately selected energetic host crystal, three host-guest inclusion HEDMs (i.e., HGI-1, HGI-2 and HGI-3) were prepared, which show detonation performances separately comparable to those of three classical HEDMs, namely RDX, HMX and epsilon-CL-20, but with mechanical sensitivities that are much superior to those of these classical HEDMs. In addition, these self-assembled HEDMs have excellent combustion properties and exhibit great potential as high-energy low signature propellants. This presented host-guest inclusion strategy shows enormous potential for tailoring the energy and sensitivity of energetic materials and will accelerate the development of advanced HEDMs in the future.",2019

Oxone (potassium peroxomonosulfate) is an efficient oxidizing agent for introducing the azoxy N-oxide functionality into the furazan backbone, giving a straightforward and low-cost synthetic route. On the basis of heats of formation calculated with Gaussian 03 and combined with experimentally determined densities, energetic properties (detonation velocity, pressure and specific impulse) were obtained using the EXPLO v6.01 program. These new molecules exhibit high density, moderate to good thermal stability, acceptable impact and friction sensitivities, and excellent detonation properties, which suggest potential applications as energetic materials. Interestingly, 3,3'-dinitroamino-4,4'-azoxyfurazan (4) has the highest calculated crystal density of 2.02 g cm(-3) at 173 K (gas pycnometer measured density is 1.96 g cm(-3) at 298 K) for N-oxide energetic compounds yet reported. Another promising compound is the hydroxylammonium salt (6), which has four different kinds of N-O moieties and a detonation performance superior to those of 1,3,5,7-tetranitrotetraazacyclooctane (HMX), and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazatetracyclododecane (CL-20).

Crystal Structure Prediction and Charge Density Distribution of Highly Energetic Dimethylnitraminotetrazole: a First Step for the Design of High Energy Density Materials,"The crystal structure of dimethylnitraminotetrazole has been predicted, based on systematically searching for densely packed structures within common organic crystal coordination types, followed by lattice energy minimization. The predicted crystal structures almost match the reported crystal structure determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. To understand the effect of the initial molecular geometry on the crystal packing, the crystal structure simulation was carried out for molecules taken from different environments, such as the X-ray structure (crystal field) and also from ab initio calculations (gas phase). The predicted crystal structures from both environments are very similar to the reported X-ray structure with a maximum deviation of 4.5%. The crystal density predicted from both methods is close to that reported. The bond topological, energetic and electrostatic properties of the isolated molecule from the predicted crystal structure have been determined using Bader's theory of atoms in molecules. The bond topological characterization reveals that the C-N bond is the weakest bond in the molecule. A large electronegative potential is found in the vicinity of the NO2 group and the nitrogen-rich region of the tetrazole ring; these are probably the reactive sites of this molecule.",2012
Antistatic modification strategy inspired by electrostatic dissipative characteristics to construct high-safety powder: A case study of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) energetic material,"To increase the industrial safety and reduce the electrostatic accumulation of ultrafine powder, we propose an antistatic modification strategy to present a new electrostatic dissipation structure, CL-20-based conducting composites with polypyrrole (PPy), which is synthesized using a pyrrole self-polymerization process. Based on the designed structures, density functional theory methods not only predict that the forming process of CL-20/pyrrole structure is spontaneous thermodynamically, but explore its desensitizing mechanism, that is, reducing the energy barrier to improve the electron transition by narrower energy gap of modified explosive. Experimental results demonstrate that new CL-20@PPy conducting structure possesses a smooth polymers cage resulting in a high drop height (H-50) (44 cm) and a low friction sensitivity (108 N), which significantly exceeds those of CL-20 of 13 cm and 72 N in turn. Besides, CL-20@PPy composites exhibit a steady electrostatic dissipation characteristic with a lower volume resistivity of similar to 10(9) Omega cm, this complex conducting polymers matrix can evacuate the electrostatic charges on the surface of CL-20, thereby it has an excellent 50 % firing energy (E-50) of 1.44 J compared to CL-20 (0.83 J). As conclusion, this adaptive and universal strategy shows a great promise for potential applications and can be extensively used in the construction for desensitizing high-energy material.",2024

"Heat-Resistant Energetic Materials Deriving from Benzopyridotetraazapentalene: Halogen Bonding Effects on the Outcome of Crystal Structure, Thermal Stability and Sensitivity","Heat-resistant energetic material (HREM) has shown its broad applications in petroleum and natural gas exploration, aerospace vehicle as well as solid rocket formulations. Benzopyridotetraazapentalene (BPTAP) (d: 1.84 g cm(-3), D: 7670 m s(-1), IS: 9 J, T-d: 366 degrees C) is a heat-resistant energetic material, which is more dense and energetic than those of commercial HREM hexanitrosilbene (HNS) (d: 1.74 g cm(-3), D: 7612 m s(-1), IS: 5 J, T-d: 318 degrees C). However, low solubility in most of commonly-used solvents has restricted its applications in detonators as nano-energetic materials. Meanwhile, recognition on this fused organic backbone is still limited. Herein, we report a chlorine-inclusion strategy and facile approaches to yield three new derivatives of BPTAP. It is notable that compound 6-a exhibits its high density (1.92 g cm(-3)), superior thermal stability (T-d: 334 degrees C), high detonation performance (D: 8084 m s(-1)), comparable sensitivity (IS: 3 J) to that of HNS, surpassing those of commercially-used highly-sensitive primary energetic material lead azide (LA). It is interesting that the chlorine-inclusion in different position of fused benzopyridotetraazapentalene framework has greatly affected their physical properties such as crystal structure, thermal stability and sensitivity. This investigation offers a unique perspective for deeply exploring the relationship between structure and performance of energetic materials.",2021
Searching for ways to create energetic materials based on polynitrogen compounds (review),"Polynitrogen compounds (containing only nitrogen atoms) are promising candidates as energetic materials for rocket engineering. The high energy content of these compounds is due to the significant difference in bond energy between nitrogen atoms. In particular, molecular nitrogen (N-2) is characterized by a uniquely strong triple bond - 229 kcal/mole, whereas the single-bond energy is only 38.4 kcal/mole. From theoretical estimates, use of polynitrogen compounds can provide a specific impulse of 350-500 sec with material density in a range of 2.0-3.9 g/cm(3). This paper gives a brief review of the current status of experimental and theoretical studies in the chemistry of polynitrogen compounds.",2010

"Synthesis, characterization and properties of new heat resistant energetic materials based on two C-C bridged pyrazole and benzene skeletons","Two kinds of heat-resistant explosives, 3,5-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole (1c) and 1,4-bis-(3,5-dinitropyrazolyl)-2,5-dinitrobenzene (2c), were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry. The structures of 1c and 2c were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and analyzed using different computing software (Multiwfn, Gaussian 09W, Diamond 3.0 and CrystalExplorer). In addition, we also investigated the thermal stabilities of these compounds by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 1c (T-d = 352 degrees C) and 2c (T-d = 321 degrees C) showed excellent thermal stabilities. The detonation properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 v6.05.04 program. The results revealed that 2c (D = 8304 m s(-1), P = 30.1 GPa) showed a higher detonation velocity and pressure than the widely used heat-resistant explosive 2,2 ',4,4 ',6,6 '-hexanitrostilbene (HNS: D = 7612 m s(-1), P = 24.3 GPa).

Facile and selective polynitrations at the 4-pyrazolyl dual backbone: straightforward access to a series of high-density energetic materials,"Nitro-functionalized energetic materials are still needed to meet new safety, performance and chemical accessibility demands. The problem of multiple C-nitrations on N-containing heterocycles was resolved successfully for the 4,4-bipyrazole scaffold. A progression of gradually functionalized 3-nitro-4,4'-bipyrazole (2), 3,3'-dinitro-4,4'-bipyrazole (3), 3,5'-dinitro-4,4'-bipyrazole (4), 3,3',5-trinitro-4,4'-bipyrazole (5) and 3,3',5,5'-tetranitro-4,4'-bipyrazole (6) was obtained in excellent yields by highly selective direct nitrations of 4,4-bipyrazole (1). All synthesized polynitro derivatives 3-6 exhibit high decomposition temperatures of above 290 degrees C. The introduction of three (5) and four nitro groups (6) into the 4,4'-bipyrazole scaffold yields insensitive and thermally stable high explosives with excellent densities and detonation properties. The anhydrous structures of compounds 2-6 were obtained by low-temperature XRD. In addition, the performance of compounds 5 and 6 was investigated with a small scale shock reactivity test.",2019
"A New Computer Code for Assessment of Energetic Materials with Crystal density, Condensed Phase Enthalpy of Formation, and Activation Energy of Thermolysis","Crystal density and enthalpy of formation of the condensed phase of energetic compounds are two important input parameters for the performance prediction in several computer codes for rapid hazard assessment of energetic materials. A novel easy-to-handle user-friendly computer code in Visual Basic is introduced to predict these parameters for various energetic compounds including nitroaliphatics, nitrate esters, nitramines, polynitroarenes, and polynitroheteroarenes. The calculated values can be used as inputs for other thermochemical/hydrodynamic computer codes. This computer code is also able to calculate the activation energies of thermal decomposition of polynitroarenes and nitramines in condensed state. The number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms and specification of some molecular fragments are input parameters for this code without using any experimental data.

Compatibility study of ,"The compatibility of trans-1,4,5,8-tetranitro-1,4,5,8-tetraazadecalin (TNAD) with some energetic components and inert materials of solid propellants was studied by using the pressure DSC method where, cyclotetramethylenetetranitroamine (HMX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 1,4-dinitropiperazine (DNP), 1.25/1-NC/NG mixture, lead 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-onate (NTO-Pb), aluminum powder (Al, particle size = 13.6 mu m) and N-nitrodihydroxyethylaminedinitrate (DINA) were used as energetic components and polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyoxytetramethylene-co-oxyethylene (PET), addition product of hexamethylene diisocyanate and water (N-100), 2-nitrodianiline (2-NDPA), 1,3-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyl urea (C-2), carbon black (C.B.), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), cupric 2,4-dihydroxy-benzoate (beta-Cu), cupric adipate (AD-Cu) and lead phthalate (phi-Pb) were used as inert materials.

First-principles based modeling of the degradation of the polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) materials caused by the collision with energetic atomic oxygen,"The aggressive conditions found in low earth orbit (LEO) present considerable challenges to the development of resilient coatings that can protect space vehicles from damaging higher energy collisions with atomic oxygen species, solar ultra-violet (UV) radiation, thermal cycling, and irradiation by protons and electrons. Organic functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) polymers have been suggested as novel potential coating materials. POSS has the chemical formula of R 8 (SiO 1.5 ) 8 . Its eight corners can be functionalized with various organic tethers which can ultimately copolymerize with conventional organic polymers and thus reinforce thermal and mechanical properties. Experimental results suggest that the hybridized POSS polymers degrade and ultimately form CO 2 , H 2 O, and silica overlayer that maintains a hybrid polymer structure underneath. Little, however, is known about the elementary paths and mechanisms. Density functional theory and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to systematically investigate dynamics of atomic oxidative degradation of various organic-tethered POSS systems. The results demonstrate that the ability to quantitatively follow multiple threshold-kinetic-energy surfaces and projected threshold forces allows for a detailed understanding of the relationship among the incident angle, kinetic energy, and product distributions. Steric hindrance and strong covalent bondings between the tethers and cage are essential to protect the structural integrity of POSS. The subsequent oxygen collision simulations show that alkyl-incorporated POSS can undergo POSS cage-opening reactions which likely lead to silica surface layer formation. A more in depth analysis necessitates the use of coarse-grained atomistic and mesoscale modeling. These simulations, however, are reliant on the development of high-fidelity forcefields. A comprehensive set of ab initio calculations were carried out to determine the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions for alkyl-substituted POSS molecules. The resulting potentials suggest that standard alkane forcefields may be used to describe alkyl substituents on the POSS cage. These potentials can be improved by noting the more repulsive interactions due to increased steric interactions by POSS. The POSS cage may be treated as a rigid cube, and the weak attraction between nonreactive tethers can be modeled by a common van der Waals potential. These potentials were subsequently used by collaborators to simulate the thermophysical behavior of tethered-POSS systems.",2008
"Regulating the melting point by non-covalent interaction toward a promising insensitive melt-castable energetic material: 1,2-Difluoro-4,5-dinitrobenzene","Searching for insensitive melt-castable energetic materials is still facing great challenges. In this work, we developed a promising strategy that is regulating the ratio of non-covalent interaction by fluorine atoms to regulate the melting point to develop new melt-castable energetic materials. Using this method, a highly symmetric 1,2-difluoro-4,5-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB) was synthesized in one step and fully characterized. DFDNB has a desirable melting point (83.2 degrees C), high decomposition temperature (> 400 degrees C), acceptable detonation properties (6786 m s(-1), 21.5 GPa) but superior safety performance (> 40 J, > 360 N), and excellent chemical compatibility with 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) that make it a promising insensitive melt-castable energetic material. A detailed study based on crystal stacking, electrostatic potential, and intermolecular weak interactions in DFDNB and its isomers or analogs demonstrates that non-covalent interactions including the C-F center dot center dot center dot H, N-O center dot center dot center dot H hydrogen bonding, and C-F center dot center dot center dot O halogen-like bonding play an important role in regulating the melting point.",2023
Increasing the limits of energy and safety in tetrazoles: dioximes as unusual precursors to very thermostable and insensitive energetic materials,"Donor-acceptor hydrogen (H)-bonding contributes to good temperature resistance for energetic compounds. Now we report a strategy which maximizes donor-acceptor H-bonding sites in the construction of new energetic compounds. The straightforward synthesis of 1,2-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) ethane-1,2-dione dioxime (2), as an unusual energetic precursor to highly thermostable and insensitive energetic materials was achieved in four steps from glyoxal (40% in water). The oxime group in compound 2 acts as a H-bond donor and acceptor and its salt formation reaction with hydroxylamine maximizes H-bonding interactions. Dihydroxylammonium 1,2-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) ethane-1,2-dione, 3, exhibits high thermal stability (285 degrees C) and insensitivity to impact (> 60 J) and friction (> 360 N) owing to the presence of donor-acceptor H-bonds and wave-like crystal packing.

Multi-scale modeling of shock initiation of a pressed energetic material III: Effect of Arrhenius chemical kinetic rates on macro-scale shock sensitivity,"Multi-scale predictive models for the shock sensitivity of energetic materials connect energy localization (""hotspots"") in the microstructure to macro-scale detonation phenomena. Calculations of hotspot ignition and growth rely on models for chemical reaction rates expressed in Arrhenius forms; these chemical kinetic models, therefore, are foundational to the construction of physics-based, simulation-derived meso-informed closure (reactive burn) models. However, even for commonly used energetic materials (e.g., HMX in this paper) there are a wide variety of reaction rate models available. These available reaction rate models produce reaction time scales that vary by several orders of magnitude. From a multi-scale modeling standpoint, it is important to determine which model best represents the reactive response of the material. In this paper, we examine three global Arrhenius-form rate models that span the range of reaction time scales, namely, the Tarver 3-equation, the Henson 1-equation, and the Menikoff 1-equation models. They are employed in a meso-informed ignition and growth model which allows for connecting meso-scale hotspot dynamics to macro-scale shock-to-detonation transition. The ability of the three reaction models to reproduce experimentally observed sensitivity is assessed by comparing the predicted criticality envelope (Walker-Wasley curve) with experimental data for pressed HMX Class V microstructures. The results provide a guideline for model developers on the plausible range of time-to-ignition that are produced by physically correct Arrhenius rate models for HMX.",2024
Ti,"For the structure materials applied in the innovative nuclear energy system, the strongly environment radiation source is always a big concern which will severely degrade the materials performance especially at high temperature. To explore the mechanisms of the anti-irradiation properties in Ti3AlC2 , a typical MAX phase material showing excellent irradiation damage tolerance and resistance to amorphization, we conducted a series of 1 MeV C4(+) ions irradiation experiments on them at different temperatures (RT, 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 800 degrees C). Through Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD), Raman spectra (Raman), slow positron annihilation Doppler Broadening Spectroscopy (DBS) and high resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), the anti-irradiation properties were systematically investigated. For the first time, an entire microstructure phase transformation process of Ti3AlC2 from alpha to beta to gamma and to perfect fee structure phase induced by irradiation at RT and it is inverse (recovery) process of phase transformation under high temperature (>= 300 degrees C) irradiation conditions are found and confirmed. And lots of simple vacancies are induced by irradiation and the density of them gets saturated above 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) fluences. These processes of phase transformation and recovery and vacancy saturation phenomenon are the primary reasons for why Ti3AlC2 has excellent irradiation damage tolerance and resistance to amorphization. In addition, the micro strain and lattice parameters are also affected by microstructure transformation and have been discussed. In a word, Ti3AlC2 materials show good anti-irradiation properties especially at high temperature, and now it is a primary candidate as the coating of the cladding material and the spallation target beam windows material in Chinese ADS project. And studies on this kind of materials provide a promising new concept and way for designing the structural materials for innovative nuclear energy system. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

Compounds 2-10 and 13 were characterized by low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All the compounds were investigated by NMR and vibrational (IR, Raman) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The excellent thermal properties of these compounds were determined by differential thermal analysis. The sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrical discharge were investigated using the BAM standards and a small-scale electrostatic discharge tester.

Effects of ,"Finding new insensitive high explosives has been the focus of the energetic materials community in recent decades. To accelerate the discovery process, it is necessary to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and the performance of explosives. In this regard, the effects of N-oxide groups, commonly introduced to increase the energy density of explosives, on the thermal stability of explosives were investigated by comparing the thermal behaviors of a typical energetic N-oxide, ANPZO, and its analogue ANPZ. The presence of N-oxide facilitated the thermal decomposition of ANPZO thoroughly and suppressed its sublimation to a certain extent. Compared to ANPZ, the introduction of N-oxide increased the thermal enthalpy, reduced the solid residues, and shortened the acceleration period of thermal decomposition of ANPZO. Additionally, the sublimation rate and vapor pressure of ANPZO were lower than those of ANPZ. The enthalpy of sublimation for ANPZO was 175.1 kJ mol(-1), compared to 135.2 kJ mol(-1) for ANPZ. The effects of N-oxide on the thermal decomposition and sublimation are attributed to its contribution to the augmentation of oxygen sources and intermolecular interactions, respectively. This study provides further insight into the relationship between the N-oxide group and the performance of explosives, which could be beneficial for the design and application of new explosives.",2024
"Facile synthesis of nitroamino-1,3,4-oxadiazole with azo linkage: a new family of high-performance and biosafe energetic materials","Energetic materials serve as remarkable fuel/propellants for space shuttles, and their utility in civil and military applications is vast. The emergence of new and powerful energetic materials possessing signature chemical structures such as nitroaromatics and oxygen/nitrogen-rich heterocyclic scaffolds continues to evolve. Nitrogen-rich materials add to the advantage of being ""green"" energetic materials by eliminating oxidative carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Here, we report for the first time a single-step synthesis of nitrogen-rich (5,5'-dinitramino-3,3'-azo-1,3,4-oxadiazole (5) and its energetic salts obtained in quantitative yields from commercially available inexpensive starting materials. Our set of molecules possessed superior energetic properties to those of benchmark explosives HMX, epsilon-CL-20, and ICM-101. Among these, compound 5 exhibited an exceptional energetic property with a remarkable density of 1.97 g cm(-3) at 298 K, high positive heat of formation (405.7 kJ mol(-1)), high detonation velocity, pressure (9358 m s(-1) and 39.1 GPa), good thermal stability (185 degrees C), and acceptable impact and friction sensitivity (6 J and 160 N). Compound 5 was recognized as a potential less sensitive HEDM with a planar and high symmetry crystal structure. Our effort to assess the toxicity profiles of our compounds against human embryonic kidney cells indicated the compounds are biosafe and nontoxic even at the concentration of 50 mu M. Together, our study points to an incredible green, high energetic material with signs of evolving to give next-generation secondary energetic materials in space, civil and military applications.",2022
"Theoretical study on benzoheterocycle based energetic materials, effect of heterocyclic-fused, conjugation, hydrogen bond, and substitutional group on the detonation performance","In this paper, four series of benzoheterocycle based energetic materials (EMs) have been designed to plan out a strategy to improve the density and safety of EMs, such as combining the insensitive group with aminobenzene ring and the high energetic nitramine explosives, benzo-heterocycle mother ring, designing multi-nitrogen heterocycles with a conjugated system containing N-N and C-N high energy bonds, and hydrogen bonding. Their optimized structure and detonation properties were first calculated and discussed using DFT methods. After calculation, these designed explosives all showed good detonation from 7352 m/s to 8788 m/s. Among them, the compounds with six nitro groups, 1c, 2c, 3c, and 4c, exhibit better performance and rather poor impact sensitivity. However, we found that the compounds with five nitro groups and one amino group have a limited performance reduction and a rapid stability improvement. These four compounds, 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4b, have good detonation performance and better stability. Moreover, the synthesis routes for these four compounds were also designed. The precursor 4-0 and mononitro product 4-1 were successfully synthesized. Their 1H NMR, single crystal, and elemental analysis were also done to verify the structures.",2018
Predicted detonation properties at the Chapman-Jouguet state for proposed energetic materials (MTO and MTO3N) from combined ReaxFF and quantum mechanics reactive dynamics,"The development of new energetic materials (EMs) with improved detonation performance but low sensitivity and environmental impact is of considerable importance for applications in civilian and military fields. Often new designs are difficult to synthesize so predictions of performance in advance is most valuable. Examples include MTO (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide) and MTO3N (2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide) suggested by Klapotke as candidate EMs but not yet successfully synthesized. We propose and apply to these materials a new approach, RxMD(cQM), in which ReaxFF Reactive Molecular Dynamics (RxMD) is first used to predict the reaction products and thermochemical properties at the Chapman Jouguet (CJ) state for which the system is fully reacted and at chemical equilibrium. Quantum mechanics dynamics (QMD) is then applied to refine the pressure of the ReaxFF predicted CJ state to predict a more accurate final CJ point, leading to a very practical calculation that includes accurate long range vdW interactions needed for accurate pressure. For MTO, this RxMD(cQM) method predicts a detonation pressure of P-CJ = 40.5 GPa and a detonation velocity of D-CJ = 8.8 km s(-1), while for MTO3N it predicts P-CJ = 39.9 GPa and D-CJ = 8.4 km s(-1), making them comparable to HMX (P-CJ = 39.5 GPa, D-CJ = 9.1 km s(-1)) and worth synthesizing. This first-principles-based RxMD(cQM) methodology provides an excellent compromise between computational cost and accuracy including the formation of clusters that burn too slowly, providing a practical mean of assessing detonation performances for novel candidate EMs. This RxMD(cQM) method that links first principles atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with macroscopic properties to promote in silico design of new EMs should also be of general applicability to materials synthesis and processing.",2018
"Agro-Pellets from Oil Palm Residues/Pine Sawdust Mixtures: Relationships of Their Physical, Mechanical and Energetic Properties, with the Raw Material Chemical Structure","The need for biomass as an alternative source for energy purposes points toward oil palm fruit residues (Elaeis guineensisJacq.) as an attractive solution. Oil palm industry residue, such as oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) composites and mesocarp fiber (PMF), have a high gross calorific value and could help countries meet their energy demands. However, information concerning physical, mechanical, and energy characteristics of agro-pellets made from mixtures of oil palm residue with pine sawdust, is not available. In this research, oil palm residues were mixed at ratios of 100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, and 0:100 with pine sawdust, and were chemically analyzed. Agro-pellets from mixtures were tested on their physical and mechanical properties, and the relationship of these properties with the chemical composition of oil palm residue mixtures was determined. Normality distribution tests of the variables were performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normal variables were analyzed through one-way ANOVA tests. When differences were found, they were validated using the Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test and were considered statistically significant atp <= 0.05. Data not normally distributed were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Bulk density, particle density, and gross calorific value of agro-pellets (from mixing 80:20 oil palm residues with pine sawdust) were statistically higher (p< 0.05) to agro-pellets of 100% oil palm residues. Adding pine sawdust to oil palm residues increases some mechanical agro-pellet properties. Addition of pine sawdust to oil palm residues acts to increase some mechanical properties of agro-pellets.",2020
"Asymmetric nitrogen-rich energetic materials resulting from the combination of tetrazolyl, dinitromethyl and (1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)nitroamino groups with furoxan","Three classes of nitrogen-rich energetic compounds 7-9 (combination of tetrazolyl, dinitromethyl and furoxan), 12-17 (combination of tetrazolyl, (1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)nitroamino and furoxan) and 20-22 (combination of dinitromethyl, (1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)nitroamino and furoxan) were obtained by selected reactions with 3,4-dicyano-furoxan. All the new compounds were thoroughly characterized by IR, NMR [H-1, C-13{H-1}], elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compounds 7, 13, 20 and 22 were also further characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Heats of formation and detonation performances for nine compounds were determined using Gaussian 03 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, showing that 15 as a secondary explosive is superior to 1,3,5-trinitrotriazacyclohexane (RDX) and 20 is a promising green primary explosive.",2018
"Pursuing reliable thermal analysis techniques for energetic materials: decomposition kinetics and thermal stability of dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50)","Thermal decomposition of a novel promising high-performance explosive dihydroxylammonium 5,50-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TKX-50) was studied using a number of thermal analysis techniques (thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and accelerating rate calorimetry, ARC). To obtain more comprehensive insight into the kinetics and mechanism of TKX-50 decomposition, a variety of complementary thermoanalytical experiments were performed under various conditions. Non-isothermal and isothermal kinetics were obtained at both atmospheric and low (up to 0.3 Torr) pressures. The gas products of thermolysis were detected in situ using IR spectroscopy, and the structure of solid-state decomposition products was determined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Diammonium 5,50-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (ABTOX) was directly identified to be the most important intermediate of the decomposition process. The important role of bistetrazole diol (BTO) in the mechanism of TKX-50 decomposition was also rationalized by thermolysis experiments with mixtures of TKX-50 and BTO. Several widely used thermoanalytical data processing techniques (Kissinger, isoconversional, formal kinetic approaches, etc.) were independently benchmarked against the ARC data, which are more germane to the real storage and application conditions of energetic materials. Our study revealed that none of the Arrhenius parameters reported before can properly describe the complex two-stage decomposition process of TKX-50. In contrast, we showed the superior performance of the isoconversional methods combined with isothermal measurements, which yielded the most reliable kinetic parameters of TKX-50 thermolysis. In contrast with the existing reports, the thermal stability of TKX-50 was determined in the ARC experiments to be lower than that of hexogen, but close to that of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20).",2017
High-speed x-ray phase contrast imaging and digital image correlation analysis of microscale shock response of an additively manufactured energetic material simulant,"The performance of energetic materials subjected to dynamic loading significantly depends on their micro- and meso-scale structural morphology. The geometric versatility offered by additive manufacturing opens new pathways to tailor the performance of these materials. Additively manufactured energetic materials (AMEMs) have a wide range of structural characteristics with a hierarchy of length scales and process-inherent heterogeneities, which are hitherto difficult to precisely control. It is important to understand how these features affect AMEMs' response under dynamic/shock loading. Therefore, temporally and spatially resolved measurements of both macroscopic behavior and micro- and meso-level processes influencing macroscopic behavior are required. In this paper, we analyze the shock compression response of an AMEM simulant loaded under several impact conditions and orientations. X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI) is used to track features across the observed shock front and determine the linear shock velocity vs particle velocity equation of state, as well as to quantify the interior deformation fields via digital image correlation (DIC) analyses. Photon Doppler velocimetry is simultaneously used to measure the particle velocities of the specimens, which are consistent with those obtained from x-ray PCI. The DIC analyses provide an assessment of the average strain fields inside the material, showing that the average axial strain depends on the loading intensity and reaches as high as 0.23 for impact velocities up to 1.5km/s. The overall results demonstrate the utility of x-ray PCI for probing ""in-material"" equation of state and interior strains associated with dynamic shock compression behavior of the AMEM simulant.",2020
Reliable prediction of the condensed (solid or liquid) phase enthalpy of formation of organic energetic materials at 298 K through their molecular structures,"A reliable new method is introduced to predict the condensed (solid or liquid) phase enthalpy of formation of organic energetic materials (at 298 K). This model is based on some additive and non-additive functions, which are based on elemental composition and some molecular fragments. The novel correlation is constructed on the basis of experimental data of 222 organic compounds containing different types of energetic bonds such as -O-O-, -N-3, -ON-O, NO2, -ONO2 and -NNO2. For 144 compounds of this set, where the best available group additivity method can be used, the root mean square (rms) deviations of the new and group additivity methods from experimental data are 31.0 and 68.2 kJ/mol, respectively. For further 77 energetic compounds, where the computed results of quantum mechanical methods for simple organic energetic compounds were available and the best available group additivity method for some complex molecules can be applied, the rms deviations of the new, quantum mechanical (54 compounds) and group additivity (51 compounds) methods from the measured data are 35.9, 42.1 and 170.6 kJ/mol, respectively.

"Synthesis and Energetic Properties of Bis-(Triaminoguanidinium) 3,3′-Dinitro-5,5′-Azo-1,2,4-Triazolate (TAGDNAT): A New High-Nitrogen Material","This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of bis-(triaminoguanidinium)-3,3'-dinitro-5,5'-azo-1,2,4-triazolate (TAGDNAT), a novel high-nitrogen molecule that derives its energy release from both a high heat of formation and intramolecular oxidation reactions. TAGDNAT shows promise as a propellant or explosive ingredient not only due to its high nitrogen content (66.35 wt.-%) but also due to its high hydrogen content (4.34 wt.-%). This new molecule has been characterized with respect to its morphology, sensitivity properties, explosive, and combustion performance. The heat of formation of TAGDNAT was also experimentally determined. The results of these studies show that TAGDNAT has one of the fastest low-pressure burning rates (at 6.9 MPa) measured till date, 6.79 cm s(-1) at 6.9 MPa (39% faster than triaminoguanidinium azotetrazolate (TAGzT), a comparable high-nitrogen/high-hydrogen material). Furthermore, its pressure sensitivity is 0.507, a 33% reduction compared to TAGzT.",2009
[(3-Nitro-1,"The strategy for the synthesis of substituted [(3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-NNO-azoxy]furazans 4-7, in which the distal nitrogen of the azoxy group is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the azole ring, includes, firstly, the reaction of 1-amino-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole with 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-(4-nitrosofurazan-3-yl)acetamide in the presence of dibromisocyanuric acid followed by removing of the trifluoroacetyl protecting group to afford aminofurazan (4). Transformation of the amino group in the latter made it possible to synthesize the corresponding nitro (5), azo (6), and methylene dinitramine (7) substituted furazans. The compounds synthesized are thermally stable (decomposition onset temperatures 147-228 degrees C), exhibit acceptable densities (1.77-1.80 g cm(-3)) and optimal oxygen balance (the oxidizer excess coefficients alpha = 0.42-0.71). Their standard enthalpies of formation (576-747 kcal kg(-1)) were determined experimentally by combustion calorimetry and these compounds have been estimated as potential components of solid composite propellants. In terms of the specific impulse level, model solid composite propellant formulations based on nitro and methylene dinitramine substituted furazans 5 and 7 outperform similar formulations based on CL-20 by 1-4 s, and formulations based on HMX and RDX by 5-8 s.",2021
"Pressure-induce structural changes of 1,1-diamino-2-nitro-2-(1-amino-1H--tetrazol-5-yl) ethene: An insensitive FOX-7-like energetic materials","We have conducted ab initio calculations using density functional theory to investigate the structural, vibrational, and mechanical properties of 1,1-diamino-2-nitro-2-(1-amino-1H-tetrazol-5-yl) ethene, as a promising high-performance explosive. The effect of high pressures, up to 50 GPa, on the structure shows that there exists a possible pressure-induced structural transition around 21 GPa. The pressure-dependent intermolecular close contacts support the notion that molecular geometry is deformed and then rearranged to achieve a new equilibrium. Furthermore, we interpret significant molecular and intermolecular changes with assistance from calculated vibrational spectrum analysis. Apart from this, the calculated elastic constants demonstrate mechanical instability above 20 GPa, which aligns with the aforementioned structural change. Finally, we report bulk moduli, Young's moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratio (nu), and the brittleness/ductility characteristics under high pressure are also analyzed.",2024
Bespoke Energetic Zeolite Imidazolate Frameworks-8 (ZIF-8)/Ammonium Perchlorate Nanocomposite: A Novel Reactive Catalyzed High Energy Dense Material with Superior Decomposition Kinetics,"Aluminum is the universal fuel for solid propellants; however, its passive oxide layer could impede the full exploitation of its enthalpy. Meanwhile, common catalyst could not contribute to combustion enthalpy. This study shaded light on the multifunctional energetic metal-organic frameworks ZIF-8 with combustion enthalpy 21 KJ/g as high energy dense material as well as a novel catalyst for solid propellants. As-prepared ZIF-8 particles exhibited a highly crystalline structure with an average particle size of 40 nm. The performance of ZIF-8 as high-energy dense material was assessed to aluminum particles via integration into ammonium perchlorate (APC). ZIF-8/APC and Al/APC composites were prepared via the solvent-nonsolvent method; the decomposition enthalpy was investigated via DSC. ZIF-8 offered an increase in APC total decomposition enthalpy by 98.4%, to 39.11% for Al. ZIF-8 exhibited a superior catalytic behavior by lowering the APC high-temperature decomposition peak (HTD) by 81.48 & DEG;C compared to 70.3 & DEG;C for Al. The decomposition kinetics of ZIF-8/AP nanocomposite was investigated via Kissinger's formula. The ZIF-8 offered a remarkable reduction in APC apparent activation energy at low-temperature decomposition peak and HTD peaks by peak by 16.5% and 30%, respectively. The superior catalytic performance of ZIF-8 was attributed to Zn+2 electron deficient centers with the exclusive formation of ZnO nanoparticles during combustion. ZIF-8 with gaseous decomposition products could boost specific impulses.",2024
Novel method for measuring primary and secondary smoke density of reduced HCl exhaust composite solid rocket propellant (CSRP) based on nitramine energetic material,"Tactical and technical demands of modern types of composite solid rocket propellant (CSRP) focused recently on decreasing both the primary smoke concentration, by minimizing the amount of solid particle as metal oxides and carbon soot, and secondary smoke concentration, by minimizing the amount of gaseous hydrogen chloride in the exhaust plume. In this work, reports the theoretical and practical methods for determining the primary smoke of composite solid propellant based on energetic material as (AP-HMX-RDX-NaNO3 ...) and polyurethane (PU) binder based on Hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) which used in many kinds of composite propellant such as Conventional, Scavenger, and non-chlorine and neutralized composite propellant. Formulations were prepared and the densities of primary smoke were experimentally determined. A smoke device was invented for practical measuring of the primary smoke concentration by determining the smoke density and compared with the theoretical results from ICT thermodynamic program which used to calculate the ballistic parameters and smoke concentration of composite propellants.

"5-(Dinitromethyl)-3-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazole and its derivatives: a new application of oxidative nitration towards ","An excellent method for the preparation of gem-trinitro compounds is destructive nitration based on an active methylene moiety with a neighboring carbonyl structure. Now described is an alternative approach where oxidative nitration was utilized to synthesize gemt-rinitro compounds. Using this strategy, 5-(dinitromethyl)-3-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazole (6) and its ionic derivatives (7-12) were designed, prepared and thoroughly characterized. This family of new energetic materials exhibits excellent densities, good detonation performances and moderate mechanical sensitivities. Interestingly, as supported by the X-ray structure of energetic salt 8, the amine-based fused ring cation induces a face-to-face pi-pi arrangement thus reducing the sensitivity of the entire molecule, and advancing the further application of similar fused ring ionic stabilizers for polynitro azole anions.

The compounds synthesized were characterized by multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, single-crystal, and powder X-ray diffraction. All the compounds possess a beneficially high enthalpy of formation (88.9-168.0 kcal.mol(-1)).

"The Volatility of Energetic Materials and How to Safely Determine Them: Exemplified by Nitro-Pyrazoles via Transpiration Method, Differential Scanning, and Bomb Calorimetry","This publication presents a detailed examination of the volatility of high energy density materials, specifically focusing on pure nitro-pyrazoles. The study uses the transpiration method to measure the vapor pressure and corresponding parameters of these energetic materials in the range of 274-422 K, ensuring safety and accuracy.

Light-Induced ignition of Carbon Nanotubes and energetic nano-materials: a review on methods and advanced technical solutions for nanoparticles-enriched fuels combustion,"Aim of the present manuscript is to provide an overview of all possible methods and light source typologies used by the different research groups for obtaining the energetic nano-materials' photo-ignition, showing the latest progress related to such phenomenon employing, also, alternative radiation sources to the common Xe lamp. In fact, the employment of a different source typology can open new usage prospects respect to those enabled by the Xe lamp, mainly due to its technological limitations. Therefore, several studies are faced to test light sources, such as lasers and LEDs, for igniting the nano-energetic materials (as CNTs mixed with metallic catalyzers, Al/CuO nanoparticles, etc); these nano-materials are usefully employed for starting, in volumetric and controlled way, the combustion of air-fuel mixtures inside internal combustion engines, leading to significant benefits to the combustion process also in terms of efficiency, reliability, and emissions of pollutants. Several research works are presented in literature concerning the ignition of liquid / gaseous fuels, without nano-particles, employing laser sources (i.e laser-based plugs in place of the common spark plugs); therefore, an innovative solution is proposed that employs multi-point laser-plugs for inducing the ignition of nano-materials dispersed into the air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder, so further improving the combustion of the fuel in an internal combustion engine.",2020
"Exploration of High-Energy-Density Materials: Computational Insight into Energetic Derivatives Based on 1,2,4,5-Tetrahydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine","Density functional theory was employed to investigate ten 1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-based energetic materials. The heats of formation and detonation properties were calculated by isodesmic reactions and Kamlet-Jacobs equations. The thermal stabilities and impact sensitivities were also estimated to give a better understanding of their decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that all of the designed compounds have high positive heats of formation ranging from 525.1 to 1639.1 kJ mol(-1), moderate detonation properties (heats of detonation of 536.6 to 2187.6 cal g(-1), theoretical densities of 1.48 to 2.32 g cm(-3), detonation velocities of 7.02 to 12.18 km s(-1), and detonation pressures of 19.8 to 75.1 GPa), and acceptable stabilities (bond dissociation energies of 0.8 to 104.9 kJ mol(-1)).

Molecular design of N-NO,"For novel high-energy low-sensitivity energetic materials, a series of novel cycloalkanes derivatives C-m(N-NO2)(m) (m = 3-8) were theoretically designed by substitution of the hydrogen atoms with N-NO2 group. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with the isodesmic reaction and the Kamlet-Jacobs equations were employed to predict the heats of formation (HOFs) and the detonation properties. We found that the designed compounds have large positive HOFs, which are proportional to the amount of N-NO2 groups. Importantly, these compounds possess high crystal densities (1.85-1.95 g cm(-3)) and heats of detonation (1811-2054 kJ g(-1)), which lead to remarkable detonation properties (detonation velocities = 9.37-9.61 km s(-1) and detonation pressures = 38.03-42.48 GPa) that are greater than those of the well-known energetic compounds 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX). Moreover, the bond dissociation energy and the impact sensitivity index h(50) values suggest that the title molecules are less sensitive than CL-20, and comparable to HMX and RDX. Therefore, our results show that the designed compounds may be promising candidates for energetic materials with notable detonation performance and low impact sensitivity.",2015
Polybenzoxazine Aerogels. 2. Interpenetrating Networks with Iron Oxide and the Carbothermal Synthesis of Highly Porous Monolithic Pure Iron(0) Aerogels as Energetic Materials,"There is a specific need for nanoporous monolithic pyrophoric metals as energetic materials and catalysts. Adapting modern-day blast furnace methodology, namely, direct reduction of highly porous iron oxide aerogels with H-2 or CO, yielded coarse powders. Turning to smelting reduction, we used the acid environment of gelling [Fe(H2O)(6)](3+) sols to catalyze co-gelation of a Second, extremely sturdy, carbonizable in high yield polybenzoxazine (PBO) network that plays the dual role of a reactive template. Formation of two independent gel networks was confirmed With rheology/dynamic Mechanical analysis performed in tandem with the same sol and its gel, and results were correlated with data from microscopy (SEM, STEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) for the elucidation of the exact topological association of the two components. By probing the chemical interaction of the two networks with infrared, Mossbauer, XRD, and CHN analysis, we found out that iron(III) oxide undergoes pre-reduction to Fe3O4 and participates in the oxidation of PBO, which is a prerequisite for robust carbons suitable as structure-directing templates. Subsequently, interconnected submicrometer-size Fe3O4 nanoparticles undergo annealing at more than 800 degrees C below the melting point of the bulk oxide and are reduced to iron(0) at 800 degrees C, presumably via a solid (C)/liquid (Fe3O4) process. Carbothermal reduction, oxidative removal of residual carbon (air), and re-reduction (H-2) of alpha-Fe2O3 formed in the previous step were all carried out as a single process by switching gases. The resulting pure iron(0) monoliths had a density of 0.54 +/- 0.07 g cm(-3) and were 93% porous. Infiltration with LiClO4 and ignition led to a new type of explosive behavior due to rapid heating and expansion of gases filling nanoporous space; annealing at 1200 degrees C reduced porosity to 66%, and those materials behaved as thermites. Ignition in a bomb calorimeter released 59 +/- 9 kcal mol(-1) of iron(0) reacted and is associated with oxidation to FeO (theoretical, 66.64 kcal mol(-1)).",2014
"Assembling Nitroamino and Amino Groups on a Pyrazolyl-1,3,4-Oxadiazole Framework for the Construction of High-Performance and Insensitive Energetic Materials","The introduction of nitroamino groups onto a nitrogen-rich heterocyclic skeleton is an efficient method for constructing high-performance energetic compounds. In this work, the nitroamino-functionalized compound 4-(5-amino-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N,N '-dinitro-1H- pyrazole-3,5-diamine was synthesized in yields of up to 83%. In addition, its energetic salts were also prepared. All these compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy and, in two cases, by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, the difference in the reactivities of the three amino groups on the pyrazolyloxadiazole system was analyzed by an average local ionization energy analysis. The hydrazinium salt of the diamine exhibits promising detonation properties and good molecular stability, suggesting it has good application potential. Compared with previous works, this strategy gives an improved isolated yield and provides a promising method for the construction of nitroamino-functionalized 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives.",
Preparation of a superfine RDX/Al composite as an energetic material by mechanical ball-milling method and the study of its thermal properties,"To research the influence of aluminum (Al) on the decomposition of 1,3,5-trimethylene trinitramine (RDX), a type of superfine RDX/Al composite as an energetic material with a mass ratio of 70/30 was successfully prepared by mechanical ball-milling method. The morphology and structure of the superfine RDX/Al composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The thermal decomposition properties were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal-infrared spectrometry (DSC-FTIR) online. The results showed that the as-prepared material was a type of a novel superfine composite with the superfine RDX particles coated on the surface of Al flakes. XPS analysis indicated that a new Al-N bond was formed in the superfine RDX/Al composite and both physical and chemical absorptions existed between RDX and Al at the same time. The thermal decomposition temperature of RDX in the superfine RDX/Al composite had a shift of about 50 degrees C towards the lower temperature range compared with that of the neat superfine RDX when tested at four heating rates of 5, 15, 25 and 35 degrees C min(-1). Its activation energy value also decreased to 70.8 kJ mol(-1) compared with that of the neat superfine RDX (119.6 kJ mol(-1)). Moreover, thermal sensitivity of the superfine RDX/Al composite increased. DSC-FTIR analysis showed that the main decomposition products of the superfine RDX/Al composite were N2O and CO2 with nearly no NO and NO2 detected. The formation of Al-N bond and reactive Al atoms are the main reasons for the notably advanced decomposition of RDX in the superfine RDX/Al composite.",2018
Investigation of the thermal degradation of the biolubricant through TG-FTIR and characterization of the biodiesel - Pequi (,"This work reports the obtaining of the methyl derivative - BP1 (biodiesel) and trimethylolpropyl derivative BP2 (biolubricant) of the pequi oil -OP, its characterization and evaluation of the thermal degradation of the trimethylolpropyl derivative through thermogravimetric analysis in conjunction with Fourier transform (TG-FTIR). Biodiesel was prepared through homogeneous methyl route and potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Biolubricant was prepared using trimethylolpropane and biodiesel (1/4M ratio) and sodium methoxide as catalyst. Spectroscopy techniques such as infrared with Fourier transform (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen and carbon (NMR H-1 and C-13) were used in the analysis of the products. Physicochemical properties such as acid number, iodine number, specific mass, and kinematic viscosity were also determined under international standard. Thermogravimetric analysis of the pequi biodiesel was performed in three different heating rates in order to evaluate the activation energy of the biodiesel by using the method proposed by Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and the value found was 67.07 kJ.mol(-1). For the biolubricant, the thermogravimetric analysis in conjunction with Fourier transform (TG-FTIR) provided interesting comprehension of the oxidation process for trimethylolpropyl esters, describing the steps of volatilization and combustion.",2019
"An Improved Safe Method for the Synthesis of Ammonium 5-Nitrotetrazolate (ANT), a Key Intermediate for the Synthesis of Green Energetic Materials (GEMs)","Ammonium 5-nitrotetrazolate (ANT) is an important precursor for the synthesis of green energetic materials (GEMs), including lead/mercury-free environmentally benign primary explosives. The currently employed methods for the synthesis of ANT are hazardous, use an excess of organic solvents/reagents and thus generate effluent. Furthermore, these methods offer low yields of ANT as they involve multistep processes. We describe herein an improved, safe and convenient method for the synthesis of ANT, which greatly improves the process safety and product yield. The advantage of this method is that it avoids hazardous operations, such as the isolation and handling of acidic copper(II) nitrotetrazolate, an extremely sensitive explosive intermediate during the preparation of ANT. In our procedure, 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT) is diazotized with sodium nitrite and nitric acid in the presence of a copper salt. The sensitive copper acid salt thus formed from the reaction mixture is treated in situ with aqueous barium hydroxide to convert it to barium 5-nitrotetrazolate and insoluble copper oxide. Finally, the aqueous barium 5-nitro-1H-tetrazolate (BaNT) is treated with ammonium sulfate to yield ammonium 5-nitrotetrazolate (ANT) in good yield. The synthesized ANT was characterized by its physicochemical properties using spectral and thermal techniques. The purity of the ANT was measured by HPLC and ion chromatography (IC). Furthermore, the structure of ANT was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis.",2017
Toward reliable characterization of energetic materials: interplay of theory and thermal analysis in the study of the thermal stability of tetranitroacetimidic acid (TNAA),"The thermal stability of energetic materials, being of the utmost importance for safety issues, is often considered in terms of kinetics, e.g., the Arrhenius parameters of the decomposition rate constant. The latter, in turn, are commonly determined using conventional thermoanalytical procedures with the use of simple Kissinger or Ozawa methods for kinetic data processing. However, thermal decomposition of energetic materials typically occurs via numerous exo- and endothermal processes including fast parallel reactions, phase transitions, autocatalysis, etc. This leads to numerous drawbacks of simple approaches. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology for characterization of the thermochemistry and thermal stability of melt-cast energetic materials, which is comprised of a complementary set of experimental and theoretical techniques in conjunction with a suitable kinetic model. With the aid of the proposed methodology, we studied in detail a novel green oxidizer, tetranitroacetimidic acid (TNAA). The experimental mass loss kinetics in the melt was perfectly fitted with a model comprised of zero-order reaction (sublimation or evaporation) and first-order thermal decomposition of TNAA with the effective Arrhenius parameters E-a = 41.0 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1) and log(A/s(-1)) = 20.2 +/- 0.1. We rationalized the experimental findings on the basis of highly accurate CCSD(T)-F12 quantum chemical calculations. Computations predict that thermolysis of TNAA involves an intricate interplay of multiple decomposition channels of the three tautomers, which are equilibrated via either monomolecular reactions or concerted double hydrogen atom transfer in the H-bonded dimers; the calculated Arrhenius parameters of the effective rate constant coincide well with experiment. Most importantly, calculations provide detailed mechanistic evidence missing in the thermoanalytical experiment and explain formation of the experimentally observed primary products N2O and NO2. Along with the kinetics and mechanism of decomposition, the proposed approach yields accurate thermochemistry and phase change data of TNAA.",2018
"Initial mechanisms for the unimolecular decomposition of electronically excited nitrogen-rich energetic materials with tetrazole rings: 1-DTE, 5-DTE, BTA, and BTH","Unimolecular decomposition of nitrogen-rich energetic molecules 1,2-bis(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)ethane (1-DTE), 1,2-bis(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethane (5-DET), N,N-bis(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)amine (BTA), and 5,5'-bis(tetrazolyl)hydrazine (BTH) has been explored via 283 nm two photon laser excitation. The maximum absorption wavelength in the UV-vis spectra of all four materials is around 186-222 nm. The N-2 molecule, with a cold rotational temperature (<30 K), is observed as an initial decomposition product from the four molecules, subsequent to UV excitation. Initial decomposition mechanisms for these four electronically excited isolated molecules are explored at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF(12,8)/6-31G(d) level illustrate that conical intersections play an essential role in the decomposition mechanism. The tetrazole ring opens on the S-1 excited state and through conical intersections (S-1/S-0)(CI), N-2 product is formed on the ground state potential energy surface without rotational excitation. The tetrazole rings of all four energetic molecules open at the N1-N2 ring bond with the lowest energy barrier: the C-N bond opening has higher energy barrier than that for any of the N-N ring bonds. Therefore, the tetrazole rings open at their N-N bonds to release N-2. The vibrational temperatures of N-2 product from all four energetic materials are hot based on theoretical calculations. The different groups (CH2-CH2, NH-NH, and NH) joining the tetrazole rings can cause apparent differences in explosive behavior of 1-DTE, 5-DTE, BTA, and BTH. Conical intersections, non-Born-Oppenheimer interactions, and dynamics are the key features for excited electronic state chemistry of organic molecules, in general, and energetic molecules, in particular.

Dynamics of combustion waves in narrow samples of solid energetic material: Impact of radiative heat losses on chaotic behavior and dynamical extinction phenomenon,"The dynamics of combustion waves propagating in a solid reacting material is investigated in the presence of radiative heat losses within the one-step Arrhenius reaction mechanism and the narrow sample approximation. As expected, a C-shaped response curve caused by the competition of heat release and heat dissipation is found where the lower branch of the response curve is unstable. Along the upper branch, the period doubling Feigenbaum's cascade occurs with increasing values of heat-loss intensity leading to chaotic dynamics. Finally, for the further increase of the heat-loss parameter, the persistent chaotic dynamics is replaced by the sudden extinction. It must be emphasized that this extinction occurs for significantly lower heat losses than the steady extinction limit associated with the turning point of the C-shaped response curve. The most unexpected finding is that the temporal interval of chaotic behavior preceding the sudden extinction event may be extremely long with apparently unpredictable duration. These results may be relevant for combustion processes in solid energetic materials or other similar systems. (C) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2020
Design and synthesis of ,"Asymmetric disubstituted N-methylene-C-bridged nitrogen-rich heterocycles (tetrazole and nitramino1,2,4-triazole) were synthesized in three steps and their nitrogen-rich energetic salts were prepared. The structures of these compounds have been established by spectral and analytical data, and, in some cases, by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Detonation performance was determined using the EXPLO5 6.01 code based on calculated heats of formation and measured densities. The N-methylene-C-bridged compounds exhibit moderate thermal stability combined with high detonation performance and acceptable sensitivity and therefore are of interest for possible application as energetic materials.",2016
A new eye-safe UV Raman spectrometer for the remote detection of energetic materials in fingerprint concentrations: Characterization by PCA and ROC analyzes,"We report the results of proximal Raman investigations at a distance of 7 m, to detect traces of explosives (from 0.1 to 0.8 mg/cm(2)) on common clothes with a new eye-safe apparatus. The instrument excites the target with a single laser shot of few ns (10(-9) s) in the UV range (laser wavelength 266 nm) detecting energetic materials like Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), Trinitrotoluene (TNT), Urea Nitrate (UN) and Ammonium Nitrate (AN). Samples were prepared using a piezoelectric-controlled plotter device to realize well-calibrated amounts of explosives on several cm(2). Common fabrics and tissues such as polyester, polyamide and leather were used as substrates, representative of base-materials used in the production of jackets or coats. Other samples were prepared by touching the substrate with a silicon finger contaminated with explosives, to simulate a spot left by contaminated hands on a jacket or bag during the preparation of an improvised explosive device (IED) by a terrorist. The observed Raman signals showed some peculiar molecular bands of the analyzed compounds, allowing us to identify and discriminate them with high sensitivity and selectivity, also in presence of the interfering signal from the underlying fabric. A dedicated algorithm was developed to remove noise and fluorescence background from the single laser shot spectra and an automatic spectral recognition procedure was also implemented, evaluating the intensity of the characteristic Raman bands of each explosive and allowing their automatic classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the discrimination potentialities of the apparatus on different sets of explosives and to highlight possible criticalities in the detection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to discuss and quantify the sensitivity and the selectivity of the proposed recognition procedure. To our knowledge the developed device is at the highest sensitivity nowadays achievable in the field of eye-safe, Raman devices for proximal detection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Energetic materials composed of coordination polymers: {[Zn (μ-atrz),"An improved synthetic pathway for trans-4,4'-azo-1,2,4-triazole (atrz) was discovered. Pure atrz was obtained directly without any other separation step in an environment friendly process. Treatment of atrz with zinc perchlorate and cupric nitrate led to the isolation of {[Zn(mu-atrz)(3)](ClO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O}(n) and {[Cu(mu-atrz)(3)](NO3)(2)center dot 2H(2)O}(n), which were well characterized. Their structures were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The calculation results of the formation of {[Zn(mu-atrz)(3)](ClO4)(2) 2H(2)O}(n) and {[Cu(mu-atrz)(3)](NO3)(2)center dot 2H(2)O}(n) indicates that the perfect crystal structures in spite of much resistance. A fundamental understanding of the structure and thermal properties involves factors, such as conjugated system, crystal structure, and inorganic metallic compounds that affect their thermal behavior. The high energy of the coordination compounds consists of chemical, electronic, and potential energy. The potential for the improvement of the coordination polymer opens up a new world for research of energetic materials.",2014
Multilayered Al/Ni energetic structural materials with high energy density and mechanical properties prepared by a facile approach of electrodeposition and hot pressing,"With an aim to fabricate multilayered Al/Ni energetic structural materials integrating high energy density and mechanical properties, a facile approach of electrodeposition and hot pressing was employed in this study. The effect of hot pressing time on exothermic reactions and mechanical properties has been systematically investigated. It was found that the exothermic heat of Al/Ni energetic structural materials decreased from 1003J/g to 782J/g, while the hot pressing process increased from 0.5 h to 4 h, and the initial exothermic reaction temperature declined simultaneously. Because of the increasing crystallite sizes of Ni and Al layers at hot pressing time of 1 h, Al/Ni multilayered materials acquired the maximum elongation, the minimum tensile strength and the lowest compressive strength. As the hot pressing process exceeded 2 h, the elongation deteriorated sharply and the compressive strength aggrandized significantly owing to the formation of the hard brittle Al3Ni phases in Al/Ni interfaces.",2019
"A new oxygen-rich and poly-nitrogen energetic complex: synthesis, properties of high energy materials and catalytic decomposition of ammonium perchlorate","Preparing green materials with excellent performance based on coordination chemistry is a challenge. In the present work, a new energetic complex, [Co(Hatzc)(2)(H2O)(2)] center dot 2H(2)O (1) (H(2)atzc = 3-carboxyl-5-amino-1,2,4-triazole), was synthesized by the diffusion method and characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, elemental analysis, infrared spectral analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. The structural analyses illustrate that 1 exhibits a 0-D motif, linked by hydrogen-bonding interactions to give a 3-D supramolecular architecture. 1 shows good thermal stability (T (dec) =283 degrees C), low sensitivity (IS > 40J, FS > 360N), prominent detonation velocity (10.18 km s(-1)), and detonation pressure (44.99 Gp). The heat of detonation of 1 (4.109 kcal g(-1)) is higher than most classical energetic complexes as shown by density functional theory (DFT). In addition, 1 shows good catalytic activity toward AP (ammonium perchlorate) decomposition by thermodynamics and dynamic analysis, which indicates 1 is a potential energetic candidate in the solid propellant field.",2021
Structure of 1-,"The structures of a novel investigative anticancer agent 1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitro azetidine (ABDNAZ, 2) and its synthetic precursor 1-tert-butyl-3-hydroxymethyl-3-nitroazetidine (1) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The data show that the chemical transformation from 1 to 2 resulted in an increase in crystal density of 0.725 Mg/m(3) (1 = 1.232 Mg/m(3); 2 = 1.957 Mg/m(3)). The azetidine ring of 1 is puckered while 2 is planar, consistent with sp(2) hybridization of the ring nitrogen following conversion of the tertiary amine to an amide. The structural information will aid in elucidating the biological activity of 2.",2013
The Effect of Particle Size of Copper Oxide (CuO) on the Heat-Induced Catalysis Decomposition of Molecular Perovskite-Based Energetic Material DAP-4,"In this study, the effect of copper oxide (CuO) with different sizes on the heat-induced catalysis decomposition of typical molecular perovskite-based energetic material DAP-4 was studied. Pure CuO with different sizes and DAP-4 are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Heat-induced catalysis decomposition performances of DAP-4 with adding CuO were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Results demonstrated that with a lower-addition CuO at the nanoscale added (1 wt%), DAP-4 had decreased at least by 36 degrees C with the heating rate of 10 degrees C/min, compared with pure DAP-4. With the CuO particle size of 50 nm, the E-a of DAP-4 heat-induced decomposition in DAP-4/CuO-50 had reduced from 159.8 kJ/mol to 120.2 kJ/mol, which is lower than DAP-4/CuO-150. The heat-induced catalysis decomposition mechanism of DAP-4 by using CuO as a nanoadditive was proposed.",2022
An Algorithm for Evaluation of Potential Hazards in Research and Development of New Energetic Materials in Terms of their Detonation and Ballistic Profiles,"In the present paper we report recommendations for safe handling with unknown explosive materials and compositions. These are based on quantum-chemical evaluations of the detonation and ballistic profiles of newly synthesized explosives and their comparison with the known reference compounds. The proposed methodology is rather simple, fast and does not require special skills. Meanwhile, it allows an effective quenching of the potential risk associated with injuries caused by accidental explosions. Additionally, we have developed two utilities, which significantly simplify the calculation process. The proposed algorithm was found to be more successful in estimation of detonation velocity of several common explosives in comparison with commercially available software EMDB, EXPLO5 and Cheetah 8.0. The reported results will be useful for scientific personnel working in the field of development and testing of explosives.",2018
"Combination of four oxadiazole rings for the generation of energetic materials with high detonation performance, low sensitivity and excellent thermal stability","Energeticmaterials, which are comprised of four oxadiazole rings and linked by three different bridges ([-NH=NH-], [-N=N-], and [-N=N(O)-]) are developed. All synthesized compounds were fully characterized and five of them were further determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. As supported by X-ray data, closed packing and extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions result in high density, low sensitivity, and excellent thermal stability. It is worth pointing out that the [-N=N-] compound 3 has a decomposition temperature of 322 degrees C, which, to our knowledge, is the highest known value for all compounds consisting of 1,2,4- and 1,2,5-oxadiazole rings. Dihydrazinium salt 14 exhibits excellent detonation performance (D = 9042 m s(-1), P = 35.0 GPa, and IS > 40 J), superior even to RDX. This novel design strategy, which combines four oxadiazole rings into one molecule, promises a fine balance between high detonation performance and low sensitivity and opens a new chapter in oxadiazole chemistry.",2017
"Spherical 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) based melt-cast compositions: heralding a new era of shock insensitive energetic materials","3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) is an unique candidate among military high explosives and is explored as a potential bomb filler with TNT in melt cast formulations. In the present study, we attempted to replace sensitive RDX with NTO with spherical morphology to develop a less hazardous, thermally stable shock insensitive composition. A bimodal mixture (150 and 25 mu m in 70/30 ratio) of spherical NTO powders with superior flowability was chosen for the formulations and achieved 60% solid loading. The temperature sensitivity of the formulations was assessed by calculating the activation energy for the flow. The velocity of detonation and shock sensitivity of the composition were also determined. The study demonstrated that the spherical-NTO/TNT (60 : 40) was found to be 2.5 times more shock and 2 times more friction insensitive than composition B which consisted of RDX/TNT (60 : 40). The activation energy for thermal decomposition was determined to assess the thermal hazards and a vacuum stability test was carried out to ensure the storage life of the composition.",2015
"High performance and heat-resistant pyrazole-1,2,4-triazole energetic materials: Tuning the thermal stability by asymmetric framework and azo-bistriazole bridge","Driven by ever-increasing application of thermal stable explosives in the deep mining and aerospace industries in recent years, the search for heat-resistant energetic materials with remarkable thermostability and high-energy level has attracted great attention. In this work, two advanced pyrazole-1,2,4-triazole-based heat-resistant explosives 5-(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole (3) and 1,2-bis(3-(3,4-dinitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)diazene (5) were obtained using straightforward two-step synthetic routes. With a high crystal density of 1.873 g cm(-3), compound 3 features with an excellent thermal decomposition temperature of 336?degrees C, which ranges the highest among fully C-nitrated bicyclic azoles. In comparison to 3, tetracyclic compound 5 exhibits enhanced thermostability (Td = 354 degrees C), which is superior to that of HNS (Td = 318 degrees C), and approaches that of TATB (Td = 350 degrees C). Furthermore, the energetic properties (e.g., detonation velocity: 8568 and 8404 ms(-1), respectively) of 3 and 5 remarkably surpass those of HNS (7612 m s(-1)) and TATB (8179 m s(-1)), thereby highlighting 3 and 5 as promising candidates for advanced heat-resistant explosives. Our described molecular design, incorporating asymmetric structural motifs with azo-bis(1,2,4-triazole) bridge, will provide a synthetically simple approach for improving thermostability of energetic materials.",2022
Time resolved long-wave infrared laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of inorganic energetic materials by a rapid mercury-cadmium-telluride linear array detection system,"A mercury-cadmium-telluride linear array detection system that is capable of rapidly capturing (similar to 1-5 s) a broad spectrum of atomic and molecular laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) emissions in the long-wave infrared region (LWIR, similar to 5.6-10 mu m) was recently developed. Similar to the conventional ultraviolet-visible LIBS, a broadband emission spectrum of condensed phase samples covering a 5.6-10 mu m spectral region could be acquired from just a single laser-induced micro-plasma. Intense and distinct atomic and molecular LWIR emission signatures of various solid inorganic energetic materials were readily observed and identified. Time resolved emissions of inorganic energetic materials were studied to assess the lifetimes of LWIR atomic and molecular emissions. The LWIR atomic emissions generally decayed fast on the scale of tens of microseconds, while the molecular signature emissions from target molecules excited by the laser-induced plasma appeared to be very long lived (similar to millisecond). The time dependence of emission intensities and peak wavelengths of these signature emissions gave an insight into the origin and the environment of the emitting target species. Moreover, observed lifetimes of these LWIR emissions can be utilized for further optimization of the signal quality and detection limits of this technique. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America",2016
Synthesis of novel materials by pulsed laser deposition and chemical vapor deposition: Part I: Energetic deposition and stability of carbon nitride thin films. Part II: Catalytic growth of one dimensional materials and devices,"The discovery and synthesis of new materials are often the driving forces for revolutionary scientific and technological advances. In this thesis, we report two aspects of our effort toward the synthesis of novel materials: the energetic deposition of carbon nitride thin films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and the catalytic synthesis of one dimensional materials and devices, including nanowires, nanotubes, and nanowire/nanotube hetero-junctions. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss the synthesis and stability of sp3-hybridized carbon nitride thin films. We developed a novel process to synthesize carbon nitride thin films based on the mechanism of energetic deposition by using a combination of PLD and atomic nitrogen plasma. We first studied the mechanism of energetic deposition of diamond-like-carbon (DLC) by PLD, using the combination of TOF-MS and EELS measurements. These studies serve as the foundation for the synthesis of sp 3 -hybridized carbon nitride. We then studied the deposition of carbon nitride thin films. The TOF-MS studies on laser plume in N 2 /He plasma showed that the concept of energetic deposition is applicable in our experiments and the kinetic energy of C + should be high enough to produce highly sp 3 -hybridized carbon nitride. However, carbon nitride films with ∼40% nitrogen always contain essentially pure sp 2 -bonded carbon. Subsequent systematical studies on the effect of nitrogen on the local bonding revealed that there is a nitrogen-driven sp 3 to sp 2 relaxation when the nitrogen concentration increases from 11 to 17%. Theoretical studies on model structures using HF and DF theory calculations showed that there is a strong energetic preference for sp 2 vs. sp 3 -bonded structure when the nitrogen concentration is larger than 12%. In the second part of the thesis, we report the catalytic growth of one-dimensional (ID) materials and devices. We developed a general laser-ablation/chemical-vapor-deposition (LA-CVD) approach to synthesize nanowires and nanotubes. In this approach, nano-sized particles are generated by laser ablation first, and subsequently act as catalytic sites in the reactive background gases for nanowires or nanotubes to growth. Single crystalline Si nanowires (SiNWs) with diameters of several to tens of nanometers and lengths larger than 10 μm have been produced by ablating Au in silane gas. Structural properties of silicon nanowires and size-controlled growth are discussed. Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and metal-filled multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) have also been produced by ablating Fe, Ni, Co, or iron oxide in ethylene gas. The experimental conditions for producing high yield, pure nanotubes are discussed. We further used the catalytic approach in two different methods to synthesize nanojunctions of Si nanowires and carbon nanotubes. In the first method, a common iron based catalyst is used to grow SiNWs first by using LA-CVD, and then to grow MWNTs by using CVD method. Nanometer sized SiNW/MWNT junctions both with or without catalyst clusters at the joint are observed with TEM. In the second method, SiNWs are grown from a catalyst attached at the end of a nanotube tip. The electrical properties of the NT/NW junctions made by this method are measured by using the Ga-In liquid metal alloy to make contact to the free end of the junction. We found that the junctions exhibit rectifying behavior characteristic of a M/S Schottky diode.",2000
"Design of new energetic materials based on derivatives of 1,3,5-trinitro-benzenes: A theoretical and computational prediction of detonation properties, blast impulse and combustion parameters","This paper reports the design of some of the new ionic based high energy materials derived from the anion of picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-ol), styphnic acid (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3-diol) and 2,4,6-trinitrophloroglucinol (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3,5-triol) and cation derived from the key synthon molecules such as 5-trifluoromethyl-1H-tetrazole, 5-dinitromethyl-1H-tetrazole and 5-azido-1H-tetrazole-1-carbonitrile. The detonation properties of these newly proposed compounds are predicted by using software such as EXPLO-5, EXTEC and LOTUSES and Keshvarz method. Moreover, other explosive parameters such as density, gurney velocity, and oxygen balance and decomposition products of the newly designed molecules have also been predicted and reported for the first time in this manuscript. The predicted detonation parameters of some of the newly designed compounds exhibit higher velocity of detonation (VOD) and detonation pressure in comparison to other well-known benchmark explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). Further, the peak over pressure (POP) and the blast impulse parameters of the newly designed compounds are predicted by using Shock physics explicit eulerian dynamics (SPEED) software, and the same is reported for the first time in this work. The work also reports the theoretical prediction of impact and electrostatic spark sensitivity parameters for the newly designed molecules. The ballistic performance parameters of the newly designed ionic energetic materials are also predicted by incorporating them into model composite rocket propellant formulations. The predicted ballistic parameters indicate that the proposed materials may find an application in the propellant formulation as an energetic additive.",2020
"Polymorphism of Energetic Materials: A Comprehensive Study of Molecular Conformers, Crystal Packing, and the Dominance of Their Energetics in Governing the Most Stable Polymorph","Polymorphism is universal in energetic crystals and brings much complexity in revealing the underlying mechanism for energetic materials against external stimuli. This work comprehensively studies molecular conformers (MCs), molecular stacking, and related MC energy (MCE) and lattice energy (LE) of polymorphs of six common energetic materials (EMs), including 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 2,2-dinitroethylene-1,1-diarnine (FOX-7), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). We find the dominance of MCE or LE in determining the most stable polymorph at common conditions is variable; i.e., LE dominates CL-20, RDX, PETN, and FOX-7, while MCE governs HMX, and for the two polymorphs of TNT at below -150 degrees C, they have almost the same stability without a difference in either MCE or LE. The variability of the dominance is responsible for the current difficulty in crystal structure predictions. Moreover, the temperature elevation reduces the molecular volume (V-m) of beta-FOX and PETN-II by weakening intermolecular interactions or crystal field effects to relax molecules to be smaller ones. Besides, the high pressure of several GPa mainly shortens the intermolecular distances, rather than compresses V-m. Finally, the heat-induced polymorphic transformation of FOX-7 from alpha- to beta- and gamma-forms allows it to be more and more closely face-to-face pi-pi stacked and serves as a reason for its low impact sensitivity. All these findings are expected to deepen insight into the response mechanism of EMs against external stimuli.",2018

It shows a density of 1.892 g.cm(-3), a positive oxygen balance and a high decomposition temperature of 250 degrees C. The promising energetic properties were also investigated by using theoretical calculation methods. Its calculated heat of formation (529.5 kl.mol(-1)) combined with impressive heat of detonation (5080 kl.kg(-1)), good thermal stabilities and clean detonation products make it a competitive replacement as a green energetic material.

"Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Shock Response of the Energetic Materials Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate and Hexahydro-1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-s-Triazine","A detailed understanding of how a material responds to some external stimulus is necessary to fully understand how that material functions. Responses to strong stimuli are generally complex processes involving chemical, mechanical, and thermodynamic changes to the system. Here, a mechanical response refers to an applied force producing a change in the structure of the material through non-chemical rearrangement of the constituent atoms and molecules. The thermodynamic response involves the conversion of mechanical energy to thermal energy, or heat, along with how the thermal energy is distributed throughout the material. Chemical response refers to the redistribution of electrons among atoms along with the associated breaking and forming of bonds. These responses are by no means independent from each other but instead are highly interconnected with one response type affecting all others in some manner.",2016
From the sensitive primary explosive ICM-103 to insensitive heat-resistant energetic materials through a local azide-to-amino structural modification strategy,"With the increasing demand for deep mineral resources and rapid development of space exploration, the search for advanced heat-resistant energetic compounds have attracted increasing attention in the field of energetic materials. In this study, we designed and prepared two new fused aromatic nitrogen heterocyclic compounds of 4-amino- 5-nitro-7H-pyrazolo [3,4-d][1,2,3] triazine-2-oxide (PTO) and 4-amino-7-methyl-5-nitro-7H-pyrazolo [3,4-d][1,2,3] riazine-2-oxide (MPTO) by a local structural modification on a highly sensitive initiating explosive (ICM-103). This minor structural adjustment endows PTO and MPTO with totally different properties in contrast to the starting material (ICM-103). The decomposition temperatures of PTO and MPTO reached 365.0 degrees C and 347.7 degrees C, respectively, around 200 degrees C higher than that (160.3 degrees C) of ICM-103. Moreover, PTO and MPTO also exhibit good detonation velocity (8528 m s(-1) and 8102 m s -1 , respectively) and low impact sensitivity (20 J and 18 J, respectively). The comprehensive performances of PTO and MPTO are superior to the widely used heat-resistant energetic materials HNS (T-d: 318 degrees C, D-v,: 7612 m s(-1), IS: 5 J) and PYX (T-d: 360 degrees C, D-v: 7757 m s(-1), IS: 10 J), demonstrating their important applied potentiality as novel heat-resistant energetic materials.",2022
A Simple Method Based on Harcourt-Esson's Equation to Estimate the Critical Temperature of Thermal Explosion for Energetic Materials Using Non-isothermal DSC,"A method for estimating the critical temperature (T-b) of thermal explosion for energetic materials was derived from Semenov's thermal explosion theory and the non-isothermal kinetic equation d alpha/dt=A(0)T(alpha)f(alpha) based on Harcourt-Esson's expression using reasonable hypotheses. The final formula is T-b=alpha T-e0/(alpha - 1), which is simple. The onset temperature (T-ei) can be easily obtained from the non-isothermal DSC curves, the value of T,0 can from the equation T-ei=T-e0+alpha(1)beta(1)+alpha(1)beta(2)(i)+alpha(1)beta(3)(i), the values of alpha can from the equation: In beta(i)=In[A(0)/(a+1)G(alpha)] + (a+1) In T-i, and then the value of T-b can be calculated. The result obtained with this method coincides completely with the value of T-b obtained by Zhang-Hu-Xie-Li's method.",2009
Estimation of Critical Temperature of Thermal Explosion for Energetic Materials Based on Non-isothermal Kinetic Equation dα/d,"Critical temperature(T-b) of thermal explosion for energetic materials is estimated from Semenov's thermal explosion theory and the non-isothermal kinetic equation d alpha/dt=A(0)exp(bT)[1+(T-T-0)b]f(alpha) deduced via reasonable hypotheses, where To is the initial point of the deviation from the baseline of DSC curve. The final formula is (T-b-T-00){1+1/[1+(T-b-T-00)b]}=1. We can easily obtain the initial temperature(T-0i) and onset temperature(T-ei) from the non-isothermal DSC curves, the values of T-00 and T-e0 from the equation T-0i or (ei)=T-00 or e(0)+alpha(1)beta(i)+alpha(2)beta(2)(i)+center dot center dot center dot+alpha(L-2)beta(L-2)(i), i=1,2,center dot center dot center dot,L, the value of b from the equation: In[beta(i)/(T-ei-T-0i)]=In[A(0)/G(alpha)]+bT(ei), so as to calculate the value of T-b.

Reaction mechanism of exfoliation degree and high temperature surface oxidation metamorphism of 2D Ti3C2Tx on thermal decomposition of various energetic materials,"Achieving higher and faster energy release processes is a major research goal for energetic materials (EMs). Typically, EMs enhance their overall performance by incorporating catalysts. The novel two-dimensional layered MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, have shown significant potential as additives for ammonium perchlorate (AP). However, there is limited research on the impact of the exfoliation degree and high temperature oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXene catalyst on the pyrolysis and combustion of different types of EMs. In this study, ultrathin Ti3C2Tx (U-Ti3C2Tx) MXene with a high exfoliation degree of approximately 20-80 nm was obtained through hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-assisted layer expansion and ultrasonic peeling. The catalytic performance of MXenes on the thermal decomposition of three types of EMs (dihydroxylammonium 5, 5 '- bistetrazole-1, 1 '-diolate (TKX-50), cyclotetramethylene tetranitroamine (HMX), and AP) was evaluated. Results showed that 4 wt% U-Ti3C2Tx can reduce the decomposition peak of TKX-50 by 33.6 degrees C and decreases the high temperature decomposition (HTD) peak of AP by 45.5 degrees C, indicating superior catalytic performance compared to non-exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene. However, it had insignificant effect on HMX. Surface chemical analysis, electrochemical characterization, thermal decomposition of gaseous products analysis and material studio simulation all confirmed that high exfoliation U-Ti3C2Tx MXene exhibited better stability and electrical conductivity, facilitating the acceleration of the H+ transfer process and rapid gas release from EMs. Additionally, ignition tests demonstrated that high exfoliation U-Ti3C2Tx could effectively participate in the ignition process of EMs. The characterization and thermal analysis of Ti3C2Tx products after high temperature and oxidation treatment indicated that the catalytic activity is weakened due to high temperature crystal collapse and surface oxidation to TiOx metamorphism. This study provides new insights for the application of MXene catalysts in EMs.",2024
"Construction and Modification of Nitrogen-Rich Polycyclic Frameworks: A Promising Fused Tricyclic Host-Guest Energetic Material with Heat Resistance, High Energy, and Low Sensitivity","The construction and modification of novel energetic frameworks to achieve an ideal balance between high energy density and good stability are a continuous pursuit for researchers. In this work, a fused [5,6,5]-tricyclic framework was utilized as the energetic host to encapsulate the oxidant molecules for the first time. A series of new pyridazine-based [5,6] and [5,6,5] fused polycyclic nitrogen-rich skeletons and their derivatives were designed and synthesized. Two strategies, amino oxidation and host-guest inclusion, were used to modify the skeleton in only one step. All compounds exhibit good comprehensive properties (T-d(onset) > 200 degrees C, rho > 1.85 g cm(-3), D-v > 8400 m s(-3), IS > 20 J, FS > 360 N). Benefiting from the pyridazine-based fused tricyclic structure with more hydrogen bonding units and larger conjugated systems, the first example of [5,6,5]-tricyclic host-guest energetic material triamino-9H-pyrazolo[3,4-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine-diperchloric acid (10), shows high decomposition temperature (T-d(onset) = 336 degrees C), high density and heats of formation (rho = 1.94 g cm(-3), Delta H-f = 733.4 kJ mol(-1)), high detonation performance (D v = 8820 m s(-1), P = 36.2 GPa), high specific impulse (I-sp = 269 s), and low sensitivity (IS = 30 J, FS > 360 N). The comprehensive performance of 10 is superior to that of high-energy explosive RDX and heat-resistant explosives such as HNS and LLM-105. 10 has the potential to become a comprehensive advanced energetic material that simultaneously satisfies the requirements of high-energy and low-sensitivity explosives, heat-resistant explosives, and solid propellants. This work may give new insights into the construction and modification of a nitrogen-rich polycyclic framework and broaden the applications of fused polycyclic framework for the development of host-guest energetic materials.",
Piezoresistive detection of simulated hotspots and the effects of low velocity impact at the mesoscale in nanocomposite bonded energetic materials via multiphysics peridynamics modeling,"The growth of hotspots within polymer bonded explosives can lead to thermal decomposition and subsequent initiation of the energetic material. An embedded structural health monitoring framework is proposed where carbon nanotubes are embedded within the polymer binder medium of polymer bonded explosives. The presence of the distributed carbon nanotube network enables the detection of hotspots through the analysis of the piezoresistive sensing response. The piezoresistive response correlates changes in the resistivity with changes in the mesoscale strain and damage distribution. The focus of the present study is on the assessment of the detection of hotspots at the mesoscale through analysis of the mesoscale thermo-electro-mechanical response via a multiphysics peridynamics modeling framework. The framework is also applied to assess the combined effects of thermal loading due to the hotspots with inertial effects due to low velocity impact loading. Prescribed hotspots were randomly seeded at various locations within the energetic material and modeled as regions with fast rising temperatures up to and beyond the point of thermal damage initiation. It has been found that the present model is able to detect the presence of hotspot dominated regions within the energetic material through the piezoresistive sensing mechanism. The influence of prescribed hotspots on the thermo-electro-mechanical response of the energetic material under a combination of thermal and inertial loading was observed to dominate the lower velocity impact response via thermal shock damage. In contrast, the higher velocity impact energies demonstrated an inertially dominated damage response, with the transition between the two damage types occurring at an impact energy around 3.75 x 10(5) J/m(3).",2021
Recent Developments for Prediction of Power of Aromatic and Non-Aromatic Energetic Materials along with a Novel Computer Code for Prediction of Their Power,"The explosive power or strength of an energetic material shows its capacity for doing useful work.

Adjacent N→O and C-NH,"Existing amphoteric energetic materials (EMs) are very scarce, and their amphoteric structures are difficult to reproduce and protonate. Herein, adjacent N -> O and C-NH(2 )groups (O <- N=C-NH2) were found to be a highly efficient and fairly balanced amphoteric energetic structure for EMs by crystal engineering and are the first discovered amphoteric structure caused by tautomerization to the best of our knowledge. As the O <- N=C-NH2 structure has existed in many synthesized nitrogen-rich EMs, our work will greatly enrich amphoteric EMs.",2021
Mechanistic Investigation on the Initial Thermal Decomposition of Energetic Materials FOX-7 and RDX in the Crystal and Gas Phase: An MM/DFT-Based ONIOM Calculation,"Interpreting the initial decomposition mechanism is important for evaluating the thermal stability of explosives. In this study, we theoretically investigated the initial thermal decomposition reactions for two typical energetic materials, FOX-7 and RDX, in both the gas phase and crystal phase. Single molecular decomposition pathways in the gas phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method, and the crystal phase reactions are simulated through the MM/DFT-based ONIOM method. The calculation results indicate that the crystal environment has a significant influence on the initial thermal decomposition mechanism of FOX-7 and RDX. The cage effect induced by the crystal environment greatly confines molecular mobility and diffusion, rendering the generated small molecules to react with the remaining fragment and yield new decomposition channels compared with the gas phase condition. The crystal packing structures and intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds/pi-pi stacking) significantly increase the reaction barriers of FOX-7 and RDX, leading to the crystal phase reactions being more difficult to occur than in the gas phase. Since the practical application of explosives is mostly in the crystal state, it is important to consider the environmental effects on the initial decomposition reactions. The same insight can also be relevant for other energetic materials.",2022
"Characterisation of the impact response of energetic materials: observation of a low-level reaction in 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1oxide (LLM-105)","Time-resolved and integrated diagnostics including high-speed photography, mass and optical spectroscopy, and optical-radiometry were used to study the impact response of high explosives in substantially more detail than possible with conventional sensitiveness tests. Specifically, we compare pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), with 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), the latter of which is currently receiving a great deal of interest as a promising insensitive high explosive. We conclude that under modest impact conditions, LLM-105 can undergo a low-level reaction whose characteristics explain apparently contradictory sensitiveness results obtained using standard tests. Our results demonstrate how more sophisticated diagnostics with large dynamic ranges, can quantify the hazard response of energetic materials in detail, enabling complex behaviour to be distinguished.",2016
Boosting Laser-Ignited Combustion Performance of Energetic Materials with Low Sensitivity: Integration of Triazene-Bridged Triazole with Oxygen-Rich Moieties via Noncovalent Self-Assembly,"It has long been a driving force in the development of energetic materials to hunt for novel high-energy density materials (HEDMs) with high energy and good stability. Recently, the noncovalent self-assembly strategy of energetic anions and cations to generate HEDMs is an effective strategy for introducing an oxidizer and fuel separately into the energy system. In this study, bis(1,2,4-triazolyl)triazene containing triazene (-N=N=NH-) and oxidant molecules (i.e., HNO3 and HClO4) were selected as high-energy ions to develop new high energy materials by using noncovalent self-assembly. The experimental results showed that three exemplary compounds possess excellent detonation pressure and detonation velocity (PC-J: 22.8-29.3 GPa and D: 7425-8135 m s(-1)), which are comparable to the classical explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) (PC-J: 19.5 GPa and D: 6881 m s(-1)) as well as 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) (PC-J: 34.9 GPa and D: 8795 m s(-1)). Moreover, 1 and 3 exhibit low mechanical sensitivities (IS: 40 J and IS: 70 J). Thus, 1 and 3 have great potential as insensitive energetic materials. Especially, these energetic assemblies have excellent laser-ignited combustion properties and can be used as candidates for low sensitivity propellants.",2023
"A Family of Energetic Materials Based on 1,2,4-Oxadiazole and 1,2,5-Oxadiazole Backbones With Low Insensitivity and Good Detonation Performance","Design and synthesis of new compounds with both high detonation performances and good safety properties have always been a formidable task in the field of energetic materials. By introducing -ONO2 and -NHNO2 moieties into 1,2,4-oxadiazole- and 1,2,5-oxadiazole-based backbones, a new family of energetic materials, including ammonium 3-nitramino-4-(5-hydroxymethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-furazan (4), 3,3 '-bis[5-nitroxymethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl]-4,4 '-azofuroxan (6), [3-(4-nitroamino-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-methylene nitrate (8), and its energetic ionic salts (10-12), were synthesized and fully characterized. The energetic and physical properties of the materials were investigated through theoretical calculations and experimental determination. The results show that the oxadiazole-based compounds exhibit high enthalpy of formations, good detonation performances, and extraordinary insensitivities. In particular, the hydrazinium salt (11) shows the best energetic properties (11: d = 1.821 g cm(-3); P = 35.1 GPa, v(D) = 8,822 m s(-1), IS = 40 J, FS > 360N). The ESP and Hirshfeld surface analysis indicated that a large number of hydrogen bonds as well as pi-pi stacking interactions within molecules might be the key reason for their low sensitivities and high energy-density levels.",2020
The effect of interface shock viscosity on the strain rate induced temperature rise in an energetic material analyzed using the cohesive finite element method,"In this work, shock induced failure and local temperature rise behavior of a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-ammonium perchlorate (AP) energetic material is modeled using the cohesive finite element method (CFEM). Thermomechanical properties used in the model were obtained from four different experiments: (1) dynamic impact experimental measurements for fitting a viscoplastic constitutive model, (2) in situ mechanical Raman spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of the separation properties for fitting a cohesive zone model, (3) a pulse laser induced particle impact experiment combined with the MRS for measurement of the interface shock viscosity, and (4) Raman thermometry experiments for measurement of HTPB, AP, and HTPB-AP interface thermal conductivity. HTPB-AP interface regions with high density of particles were found to be more susceptible to local temperature rise due to the presence of viscoplastic dissipation as well as frictional heating. The increase in the interface shock viscosity lead to a decrease in both the viscoplastic and frictional dissipation. This resulted in a decrease in the maximum temperature and the density of local regions with a maximum temperature rise within the HTPB-AP microstructure. A power law relation for the decrease in viscoplastic energy dissipation, temperature rise and the density of the local temperature rise with the interface shock viscosity was obtained.",2019

 synthesized 3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from transition metal cations and tetrazole derivatives: a family of insensitive energetic materials,"The combination of the hydrothermal method with in situ synthesis has been successfully employed to prepare a family of tetrazole-based energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs) ([Ag(Mtta)](n), 1; [Cd-5(Mtta)(9)](n), 2; [Pb-3(bta)(2)(O)(2)(H2O)](n), 3; and [Pb(tztr)(2)(H2O)](n), 4) through [2 + 3] cycloaddition of azide anions and nitrile groups. All the synthesized EMOFs were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (EA), different scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry (TG). Both complexes 1 and 4 consist of reticular two-dimensional (2D) layers that are linked by pi-pi overlap interactions between the ligands in neighbouring layers to form 3D supramolecular structures. In contrast, complexes 2 and 3 are 3D frameworks. The in situ formation of ligands bta and tztr has been described for the first time. Remarkably, thermogravimetric measurements demonstrated that the EMOFs 1-4 possess excellent thermostabilities with high decomposition temperatures up to 354, 389, and 372 degrees C for 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Sensitivity tests revealed that all the EMOFs are extremely insensitive.",2017
"Estimated Detonation Velocities for TKX-50, MAD-X1, BDNAPM, BTNPM, TKX-55, and DAAF using the Laser-induced Air Shock from Energetic Materials Technique","Since new energetic materials are initially produced in very small quantities for both safety and cost reasons, laboratory-scale methods for characterizing their performance are essential for determining the most promising candidates for scale-up. Laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM) is a promising new method for estimating the detonation velocity of novel explosives using milligram amounts of material, while simultaneously investigating their high temperature chemical reactions. LASEM has been applied to 6 new explosives for the first time: TKX-50, MAD-X1, BDNAPM, BTNPM, TKX-55, and DAAF. Emission spectroscopy of the laser excited materials revealed the formation of the high pressure bands of C-2 during the ensuing exothermic reactions. The low thermal sensitivity of the materials also led to unusual laser-material interactions, visualized with high-speed video. The estimated detonation velocities for the 6 explosives were compared to predicted values from EXPLO5 and CHEETAH. The LASEM results suggest that TKX-55, BDNAPM, and BTNPM have higher detonation velocities than predicted by the thermochemical codes, while the estimated detonation velocities for MAD-X1 and TKX-50 are slightly lower than those predicted.",2017

By combining nitrogen-rich tetrazole and oxygen-rich furoxan, a linear C-C bonded pentaheterocyclic energetic compound, 3,4-bis(3-tetrazolylfuroxan-4-yl) furoxan (BTTFO), was synthesized using a facile and straightforward method. Comprehensive X-ray analysis reveals the key role of hydrogen bonds, pi-pi interactions, and short contacts in the formation of dense packing of BTTFO and explains why a long chain-shaped molecule has a high density. This multicyclic structure incorporating three furoxan and two tetrazole moieties results in an exceptionally high heat of formation (1290.8 kJ mol(-1)) and favorable calculated detonation performances (v(D), 8621 m s(-1), P, 31.5 GPa). The interesting structure and fascinating properties demonstrated the feasibility of a linear multicyclic approach as a high-energy-density skeleton. Additionally, the thermodynamic parameters, electrostatic potential (ESP), and frontier molecular orbitals were also studied to get a better understanding of structure-property correlations.",2020

TzTA was prepared in good yields and characterized using analytical (elemental) and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, NMR) techniques. The crystal structure of sulfate salt of the molecule was solved by means of low temperature X-ray crystallography, which showed the co-planarity of the two rings. The sulfate salt of the molecule crystallized in monoclinic system P21/n, with a crystal density of 1.856 g cm(-3). The thermal stability of the molecule was assessed by DSC. The molecule showed excellent thermal stability better than many known nitrogen rich energetic molecules and showed comparable thermal stability with HMX. Non-isothermal kinetics was performed on the molecule to derive the activation energy. Constant volume combustion energy was determined using oxygen bomb calorimeter and back calculated the heat of formation.

Parameterizing Complex Reactive Force Fields Using Multiple Objective Evolutionary Strategies (MOES): Part 2: Transferability of ReaxFF Models to C-H-N-O Energetic Materials,"The Multiple Objective Evolutionary Strategies (MOES) algorithm was used to parametrize force fields having the form of the reactive models ReaxFF (van Duin, A.

"A Safer Synthesis of 3,5-Bis(dinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazole (BDT) and Its Mono and Di Salts: High-Performance Insensitive Energetic Materials","Design and synthesis of new insensitive high-performance energetic materials are significant because of the demands of both civilian and military applications. Now a straightforward route which does not necessitate the use of 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) as a starting material has been developed to synthesize 3,5-bis(dinitromethyl)1,2,4-triazole (BDT) and its mono and dianion salts. The Xray structure of bis- triaminoguanidinium 3,5-bis(dini-tromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolate (10) further confirms the structure of this dianion. The gem dinitro carbon results in higher packing coefficients and extensive hydrogen bonding interactions. The experimental densities range from 1.66 to 1.93 gcm(-3), detonation velocities from 8347 to 9086 ms(-1), and pressures from 27.3 to 38.7 GPa, respectively.

Self-organizing of the micro-structures in the reactionary zones of the energetic materials and excitation of the phenomenon of waves of negative erosion,The wavy propagation of the local zones captured by negative erosion along the energetic material burning surface is implied under the phenomenon of waves of negative erosion. The key to the understanding of this effect is the electro-chemical phenomena in the reactionary zone of burning energetic material. It is proposed that the phenomenon of excitation of periodic toroidal vortex micro-structures over the burning surface plays a key role in the realization of the phenomenon of negative erosion. The boundary of existence of the phenomenon of negative erosion is determined by stability of self-organized toroidal-shaped vortex microstructures in the stream of the combustion products which is blowing the burning surface.

"Structure-Performance Relationship in Thermally Stable Energetic Materials: Tunable Physical Properties of Benzopyridotetraazapentalene by Incorporating Amino Groups, Hydrogen Bonding, and π-π Interactions","Structure-performance investigation has become one of those significant trends for energetic materials and energetic crystallography inevitably. Herein, we report two new energetic materials deriving from a famous thermally stable explosive benzopyridotetraazapentalene, which was first developed by Huynh and Hiskey, et al., at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Owing to the incorporation of amino groups, these two energetic materials exhibit different amusing physical performance. Understanding their structures, properties, performances, and the relationship among them is the basis for the rational design of thermally stable energetic materials. Moreover, for these energetic conjugated systems, the density overlap regions indicator analysis was also employed for necessarily visualizing and quantifying the covalent and noncovalent interactions. It is evident that this strategy of incorporating amino groups into energetic materials increased the coplanarity of the energetic fused ring, owing to the contribution of hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions, which can further decrease their sensitivity. However, we also found that the integrity of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction was the critical factor, which affected the thermal stability of energetic molecules with the amino groups inserting progressively. It is notable that diamino-substituted energetic compound 8 exhibits comparable thermal stability (320 degrees C) to that of HNS, more dense (d: 1.84 g cm(-3)), higher nitrogen content (37.43%), and lower sensitivity (impact sensitivity: 12 J, friction sensitivity > 360 N), superior to those of HNS.

"Combination of 1,2,4-Oxadiazolone and Pyrazole for the Generation of Energetic Materials with Relatively High Detonation Performance and Good Thermal Stability","Oxadiazoles are the satisfactory structural units of energetic materials due to high densities. However, the practical use of most oxadiazole compounds in energetic materials is limited by their low thermal decomposition temperature (<180 degrees C). In this work, 3-(3-nitro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one (6) with relatively high detonation performance (D-v = 8315 m s(-1); P = 29.22 GPa) and good thermal stability (T-d = 275.9 degree celsius) has been successfully synthesized by the introduction of a pyrazole backbone into the oxadiazole skeleton, which is better than HNS (D-v = 7612 m s (-1); P = 24.3 GPa). In addition, compound 6 was synthesized using a green, low-toxicity three-step process (cyclization, amination, and hydrolysis) rather than highly toxic cyanogen bromide. To investigate the correlation between the structure and stability of compound 6, calculations of Hirshfeld surface analysis, 2D-fingerprint plots, and electrostatic potentials were performed. This provides a guide to synthesizing energetic materials with high detonation and good thermal stability.",2024
"A Study of 5-(1,2,4-Triazol-","The synthesis and full structural and spectroscopic characterization of three 5-(1,2,4-triazol-C-yl)tetrazol-1-ol compounds with selected energetic moieties including nitrimino (5), nitro (6) and azido (7) groups are reported. The influence of those energetic moieties as well as the CC connection of a tetrazol-1-ol and a 1,2,4-triazole on structural and energetic properties has been investigated. All compounds were well characterized by various means, including IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and DSC. The molecular structures of 5-8 were determined in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The standard heats of formation were calculated on the CBS-4M level of theory utilizing the atomization energy method, revealing highly positive values for all compounds. The detonation parameters were calculated with the EXPLO5 program and compared to the common secondary explosive RDX. Additionally, sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined.",2013
Energy-releasing properties of metal hydrides (MgH ,"Metal hydride has been used as a potential energetic material due to its high hydrogen storage density, high reactivity, high mass calorific value and large gas production. But it was still a great challenge towards optimizing and enhancing the energy-releasing properties of metal hydride. In this work, a novel molecular perovskite energetic material (H 2 dabco)[NH 4 (ClO 4 ) 3 ] (DAP-4) was introduced as a high energy oxidant to fabricate metal hydride (MH 2 , M = Mg, Ti, and Zr) based energetic composites. The thermal decomposition, ignition and combustion characteristics of MH 2 -based energetic composites were studied. The results showed that molecular perovskite energetic material DAP-4 was beneficial as oxidant in MH 2 -based high-energy solid composites, which were originated from its high energy properties and strong oxidation capacity. The ignition and combustion reaction mechanisms of MH 2 with DAP-4 as oxidant were provided. This work offered an effective way to realize energy-releasing performance of MH 2 by molecular perovskite energetic materials introduced for their potential application.

"Electrolytic oxidation of 1H-1,2,4-triazole, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole for energetic material synthesis","In order to change the energy release properties of energetic materials by altering the electronic state, the electrolytic oxidation of azoles with sodium perchlorate was carried out at conditions determined by linear sweep voltammetry. The change in electronic state due to the electrolytic oxidation was verified using ultraviolet spectroscopy. The thermal stability of products was investigated using sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis. The electrolytic oxidation provided products whose onset temperatures of peaks differed from those of reactant azoles. The electrolytic oxidation destabilized 1,2,4-triazole (TA) and 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole (4ATA), but increased the stability of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3ATA). However, distinct exothermic peaks were observed and Q(DSC) significantly increased for all triazole products. The gasification rates increased by more than 50 % due to electrolytic oxidation. In particular, electrolytic oxidized TA with perchlorate reached 99.5 % of gasification rate. These results confirmed that electrolytic oxidation is a promising method for developing new energetic materials with favorable energy release properties.",2021
Comparison of the Implemented Detonation Velocity Predictions in the Research Output Software for Energetic Materials Based on Observational Modelling (RoseBoom©) with 30 Experimental Values,"So far, the accuracy of the new Computer Software RoseBoom (c) has only been determined by comparing it to the Program EXPLO5. In the present study RoseBoom (c)'s predictions are compared with 30 experimental detonation velocities, in order to evaluate which of the computer codes is more accurate.",2023
"1,5-Diaminotetrazole-4","5-Amino-1-benzyloxytetrazole was aminated with O-tosylhydroxylamine. The diaminobenzyloxytetrazolium intermediate was debenzylated to yield the highly energetic 1,5-diaminotetrazole-4N-oxide (SYX-9). The molecule underwent both chemical and energetic characterization, including N-15 NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, which reported a 1.820 g cm(-3) ambient temperature density. Theoretical energetic performances were determined by a combined experimental-computational method using calculated heats of formation and experimental room temperature densities. SYX-9 was calculated to have an exciting detonation velocity of 10 000 m s(-1), making this energetic tetrazole molecule one of the few energetic materials reaching this high performance milestone. This material was found to be very sensitive to mechanical and thermal stimuli.",2022
"Effects of rotational speed on microstructure, exothermic reactions and mechanical properties of Al/Ni energetic structural materials prepared by hot pressing and friction stir processing","In order to fabricate Al/Ni energetic structural materials (ESMs) with high energy density and mechanical properties, a novel approach of hot pressing and friction stir processing (HP-FSP) was employed in this study. The effects of rotational speed on microstructure, exothermic reactions and mechanical properties of Al/Ni ESMs were investigated. The microstructure characteristics were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Differential scanning calorimeter, quasi-static compression and microhardness tests were conducted to analyze the energy density and mechanical properties, respectively. The results showed that the compressive strength and the energy density of Al/Ni ESMs without friction stir processing (FSP) were 183 MPa and 1110 J/g, respectively. Numerous Ni particles were broken and elongated to irregular granules and fibrous microstructure during FSP procedure. As the rotational speed reached 800 rpm, the Al/Ni ESMs prepared by HP-FSP method exhibited excellent comprehensive properties with the compressive strength of 416 MPa and the energy density of 856 J/g. With the increasing rotational speed, the compressive strength, elastic modulus and maximum microhardness increased first and then decreased, and the energy density decreased gradually. It was found that the enhancement of mechanical strength was attributed to dislocation strengthening and second phase strengthening. The reduction of exothermic energy density was ascribed to the increasing heat input of FSP treatment, intensifying the reaction diffusion in Al/Ni interfaces and promoting the generation and proliferation of Al3Ni phases.",2024
"Thermal and energetic behaviour of solid-solid-liquid phase change materials storage unit: Experimental and numerical comparative study of the top, bottom and horizontal configurations","Thermal energy storage technology with Phase Change Materials (PCM) is an attractive option to optimise energy resources and to recover and promote excess heat. The phase change behaviour of PCM requires advanced research to understand and better control the thermal energy storage using PCM, which is a crucial step to develop a powerful latent storage system. This paper aims to analyse the multiphysics phenomena of three regenerator configurations, horizontal case and two injection direction of Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF): top and bottom in vertical case. The study is done for the charge and discharge cycles of the solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions of PCM. First, the temperature dependence of the thermal and physical properties of paraffin as PCM is characterised. Second, an experimental study of an annular latent storage system was carried out. Also, an experimental mesh method was introduced to compare the energy behaviour of the three cases. Third, a numerical analysis of the experimental storage unit with low thermal diffusion is performed. The experimental results are confronted with the numerical results obtained with ANSYS Fluent and COMSOL Multiphysics commercial software. Last, the three configurations are compared to a reference case without gravitational field. The results show that specific mechanisms control the thermal and energetic behaviour of the regenerator. Furthermore, several parameters, such as storage density, distribution of energy storage rate in the different regenerator components (PCM, HTF, and heat exchanger), were analysed. Altogether, the results supply important information to understand the dynamics of passive storage systems.",2021
"Colorimetric Sensing of the Insensitive Energetic Material 3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) Using l-Cysteine Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles and Copper(II)","Since conventional sensitive explosives have given rise to unforeseen accidents during storage and transport, the demand of modern armies for insensitive energetic materials is on the rise. There are very few determination methods for the most widely used insensitive energetic materials such as 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one (NTO). Thus, the aim of this work is the development of a rapid and practical nanoparticle-based colorimetric sensor for determination of NTO. The detection principle of the sensor involved electrostatic attraction of NTO anion to the ammonium group of l-cysteine functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNP-Cys), followed by the formation of a Cu2+-coordination complex between particles to result in AuNPs agglomeration. The concomitant color change was from red to violet. The surface plasmon resonance band of AuNPs at 520 nm shifted to 650 nm upon chemical reaction and agglomeration. Spectroscopic evaluation was made by taking the ratio of 650 nm absorbance to that of 520 nm, and correlating this ratio to NTO concentration. The analytical performance characteristics of this ratiometric sensor for NTO as the molar absorptivity (epsilon); limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were: epsilon = (8.62 +/- 0.29) x 10(3) L mol(-1) cm(-1), LOD = 0.25 mg L-1, and LOQ = 0.85 mg L-1. The sensor was applied to various energetic material mixtures containing 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine, and tetryl. Additionally, the possible interference effects of commonly found soil ions such as Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, PO43-, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, and K+ were studied. The proposed method was statistically validated against a literature liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method.",2019
Optical and photonic material hardness for energetic environments,"We studied the effects of dielectric change in the chemical composition and in the realization procedures under radiation exposure. We have compared the radiation effects on Ge-doped and F-doped fibers and preforms: the first play a crucial role in the photosensitivity property, the second improves the dielectric radiation hardness even at low concentrations. The use of different spectroscopic techniques (RIA, OA, EPR) allow the identification of the point defect formation mechanisms at the origin of the optical degradation properties.",2008
High-current electron beam initiation of explosive reactions in energetic materials in the presence a nanosized-particle inert admixture and the size of hot spots,Experimental data on the low-energy high-current electron beam initiation of some energetic materials in the presence of a nanosized inert powder (copper oxide) are reported. The resistance of the energetic material + inert admixture composition to the action of the pulsed electron beam is demonstrated to fall dramatically at a certain admixture concentration.,2015
A New Strategy for Storage and Transportation of Sensitive High-Energy Materials: Guest-Dependent Energy and Sensitivity of 3D Metal-Organic-Framework-Based Energetic Compounds,"Reaction of Co(II) with the nitrogen-rich ligand N,N-bis(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-amine (H(2)bta) leads to a mixed-valence, 3D, porous, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based, energetic material with the nitrogen content of 51.78%, [Co-9(bta)(10)(Hbta)(2)(H2O)(10)](n)center dot(22H(2)O)(n) (1). Compound 1 was thermohydrated to produce a new, stable, energetic material with the nitrogen content of 59.85% and heat of denotation of 4.537 kcal cm(-3), [Co-9(bta)(10)(Hbta)(2)(H2O)(10)](n) (2). Sensitivity tests show that 2 is more sensitivity to external stimuli than 1, reflecting guest-dependent energy and sensitivity of 3D, MOF-based, energetic materials. Less-sensitive 1 can be regarded as a more safe form for storage and transformation to sensitive 2.",2014
Correlation of Efficient Dispersion and Catalytic Performance of Nanocombustion Catalysts in Energetic Materials: A Case Study of the Nanocopper Oxide Catalyst with Superfine Ammonium Perchlorate,"Obviously, the dispersion of nanocatalytic materials has significant influence on their catalytic performance. In this study, an evaluation method for the dispersion of nanomaterials was established according to the different solid UV absorptions of different substances by taking the dispersion of nanocopper oxide (nano-CuO) in superfine ammonium perchlorate (AP) as an example. The nano-CuO/superfine AP composites with different nano-CuO dispersions can be obtained by changing the process parameters, such as varying the grinding method, the grinding strength, and the grinding time. Three replicate experiments were carried out for different composites to derive the average values of absorbance at 212 nm, and the dispersion of nano-CuO in superfine AP was calculated using the difference equation, as the solid UV curves at 210-214 nm were almost identical for each sample, especially at 212 nm. The properties of different samples were tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS). The results show that the particle size and structure of superfine AP in the composites prepared by different methods were not changed. The XRD and IR techniques in this study were unable to characterize the dispersion of nano-CuO in the composites due to its low content. The dispersion of nano-CuO in the nano-CuO/superfine AP composites was significantly enhanced with the increase of grinding strength and grinding time, and the dispersion of nano-CuO was positively correlated with its catalytic performance, which means that the thermal decomposition performance of different composites improved with the increasing dispersion of nano-CuO. Highly dispersed nano-CuO exhibited a significant catalytic effect on superfine AP in TG-MS. The above conclusions demonstrate the accuracy of the difference equation for evaluating the dispersion of nanomaterials based on solid UV curves, which is expected to be used extensively in evaluating the dispersion of nanocatalytic materials in energetic materials.",2023
"Theoretical Prediction of Structures and Properties of 2,4,6-Trinitro-1,3,5-Triazine (TNTA) Green Energetic Materials from DFT and ReaxFF Molecular Modeling","Nitryl cyanide, O2NCN, as a new high-energy molecule, has not yet been successfully synthesized. It has prompted us to conduct a theoretical study of its possible space structures and properties. The RESP charges and the most stable spatial structures demonstrate that crystal morphology is affected by both the main nonbonded interactions and the molecular arrangement. The crystal structure prediction indicated that there are seven structures, namely P1, P2(1), P2(1)2(1)2(1), P2(1)/c, Pna2(1), Pbca, and C2/c. The most stable space structure is likely to be Pna2(1) and the corresponding cell parameters are Z = 4, a = 8.69 angstrom, b = 9.07 angstrom, c = 9.65 angstrom, and alpha = beta = gamma = 90.0 degrees. To further study the intermolecular interactions of TNTA, a series of theoretical analyses were employed, including Hirshfeld surface analysis and fingerprint plots. The pyrolysis mechanism and properties show that high temperatures can promote decomposition. The systematic search approach can be a new strategy to identify structures effectively and has the potential to provide systematic theoretical guidance for the synthesis of TNTA.",2022
A novel electrochemical sensor based on phosphate-stabilized poly-caffeic acid film in combination with graphene nanosheets for sensitive determination of nitro-aromatic energetic materials,"This work offers a novel approach and sensor electrode for electrocatalytic reduction of nitro-aromatic explosives (NAEs). This sensor was created by combining electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets (GNSs)-through cyclic voltammetric reduction of a graphene oxide colloidal solution-with phosphate-stabilized poly-caffeic acid (pCAF) film-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The poly-caffeic acid-modified nonconductive electrode was stabilized with a H2PO4-/HPO42-phosphate buffer at pH 7 and made conductive. The novel electrode, called phosphate stabilized-GC/GNSs/pCAF, was characterized by electrochemical methods and scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM). The sensor exhibited high performance for trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection with a linear response between 50 and 500 mu g L-1 and a detection limit of 6 mu g L-1. In addition to TNT, precise determinations of NAEs such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), tetryl (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl methyl nitramine), trinitro phenol (TNP or picric acid; PA), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and 4-amino dinitrotoluene (4A-DNT, an aerobic bacterial degradation product of TNT) were made using the developed sensor electrode and DPV technique. Simultaneous quantification of TNT and DNT was performed with the aid of a computational technique known as multiple linear regression (MLR). The optimized electrode was resistant to interference effects. Satisfactory results on real samples were obtained by applying the modified electrode to the determination of TNT, tetryl, and TNP in contaminated soil. The validation of the proposed method was made against a literature LC-MS/MS method. A statistical comparison of the obtained results was provided using F-and Student's t-tests.",2024
"A THEORETICAL STUDY OF ENERGETIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HIGH TEMPERATURE MOLTEN MATERIALS AND A LOW TEMPERATURE FLUID (FUEL-COOLANT, INTERACTION, VAPOR EXPLOSION, HEAVY WATER NUCLEAR REACTOR)","Analytical models have been developed to predict the hydrodynamic transients resulting from the energetic interactions between a high temperature molten material and a low temperature liquid coolant. Initially, the molten material at high temperature and pressure is separated from the low temperature fluid by a solid metal barrier. Upon contact between the molten material and solid barrier, thermal attack occurs eventually resulting in a loss of barrier integrity. Subsequently, the molten material is injected into the liquid pool resulting in energetic interactions. The analytical models have integrated a wide variety of potentially mutually-interacting transport phenomena which dominate the transient process into a deterministic scheme to predict the hydrodynamic transient process. The model calculations have been compared with the existing experimental results to show its engineering accuracy and adequacy in predicting such energetic interactions. In addition, sensitivity analyses have been performed for the models by varying the values of the major parameters to justify the values of parameters assumed in the numerical calculations. Two models have been formulated to bracket the transport of molten material to the rupture site for the reactor system. The ""stratified"" model minimized the rate of transport of material to the break location while the ""dispersed"" model maximized such transport. These two models have been applied to a reference pressure tube reactor to evaluate the pressure transients and the potential structural damages as a result of a postulated severe primary coolant blockage in a power channel. The results of the analyses indicated the following: (1) up to 12 adjacent pressure tubes could be permanently deflected, (2) up to all of the calandria tubes could be collapsed onto their associated pressure tubes, (3) the calandria vessel integrity would not be threatened by the hydrodynamic transient.",1984
A facile synthesis of nano-layer structured g-C,"The construction of a high-performance g-C3N4 photocatalyst through a facile and green synthesis method remains a great challenge for H-2 production and organic pollutants degradation. In this work, we developed a nano-layer structured g-C3N4 (NL-CN) photo-catalyst with a 230 m(2)/g surface area via the thermal polymerization method using melaminium dinitrate (MDN), which is one of the more energetic materials, as the precursor. The energy coming from the drastic decomposition of nitrate anions in MDN caused the thick layers of bulk CN to be exfoliated to produce many much-thinner nano-layers when at 500 degrees C for 2 h, which obviously elevated the surface area of the g-C3N4. The resultant NL-CN displays a superior visible-light H-2-generation and rhodamine B (RhB) photo-degradation efficiency (lambda > 420 nm) compared to those of bulk g-C3N4 (CN) prepared through heating melamine because of the nano-layered structures, which lead to higher specific surface areas, a rapid charge transfer efficiency and a higher redox potential. These results demonstrate that the utilization of MDN as a starting material provides a new opportunity for the facile and green synthesis of high-efficiency nanostructured g-C3N4 photocatalysts with lower energy consumption and environmental pollution levels.

Recent Advances in the Study of the Initiation of Energetic Materials Using the Characteristics of Their Thermal Decomposition Part II. Using Simple Differential Thermal Analysis,"Simple Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), with evaluation of its output by the Kissinger method, was used in the case of emulsion explosives and, as an advanced application, for several plastic bonded explosives (PBXs). In both of these kinds of explosive the square of their detonation velocities, D-2, is used as their performance characteristic. A relationship between the slope of the Kissinger equation, EaT-1, and the D-2 values makes it possible to formulate a possible mechanism for the initiation of emulsion explosives. Regarding PBXs, it would seem possible to postulate a change in the detonation chemistry of plastic bonded nitramines, depending on the pressure and temperature in the zone of the detonation wave, particularly in the case of CL-20 fillers. Binders with aromatic building units in their macromolecular structure seem to be less-favoured in terms of their thermal reactivity and performance than the final PBXs. These findings document the advantages of the above-mentioned application of simple DTA.",2014
"Reliable prediction of crystal density of high nitrogen-containing organic compounds as powerful, less sensitive, eco-friendly energetic materials for dependable assessment of their performance","Many efforts have been done in recent years to seek more powerful, less sensitive, eco-friendly high nitrogen -containing organic compounds (HNCOCs). It is essential to have reliable methods for the prediction of crystal density of the new proposed HNCOCs because increasing density is associated with increased performance. This work uses structural parameters of HNCOCs and semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations using the PM6 method for reliable prediction of their densities at or near room temperature. A core correlation is introduced for the calculation of the density of HNCOCs based on the number of functional groups -NH2, >NH, -OH, and -N3 as well as the calculated density from the PM6 method. The reliability of the core correlation is improved by considering two non-additive correcting functions, which can increase or decrease the predicted values of core density. The reported densities of 137 HNCOCs as training (117 compounds) and test (20 chemicals) sets are used to establish the new model. High reliability of the core and improved models are compared with the computed results of the best available molecular surface electrostatic potential (MESP)-based method. The values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the improved model and comparative MESP-based method are 0.0472 and 0.0951 g/cm3, respectively. High reliability of the new method was also confirmed as compared to four MESP-based models for 32 compounds of external test data set where RMSE of the improved model (0.0674 g/cm3) is smaller than four MSPE-based methods, i.e. 0.126, 0.276, 0.0716, and 0.0703 g/cm3.",2023
"New Roles for 1,1-Diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7): Halogenated FOX-7 and Azo-bis(diahaloFOX) as Energetic Materials and Oxidizers","The syntheses and full characterization of two new halogenated 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) compounds and three halogenated azo-bridged FOX-7 derivatives are described. Some of these new structures demonstrate properties that approach those of the commonly used secondary explosive RDX (cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine). All the compounds display hypergolic properties with common hydrazine-based fuels and primary aliphatic amines (ignition delay times of 2-53 ms). This is a new role that has yet to be reported for FOX-7 and its derivatives. Their physical and energetic properties have been investigated. All compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, elemental analysis, infrared spectra, and differential scanning calorimetry. These new molecules as energetic materials and hypergolic oxidizers contribute to the expansion of the chemistry of FOX-7.",2013

They were characterized by IR and multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction are given. The X-ray structures show that in the title compound, the hydrogen atom is bonded to the nitrogen in the pyrazine ring; however, in the salts, the negative charge is associated with the triazole nitrogen. Heats of formation for all compounds were calculated with the G2 method and then combined with experimentally determined densities to obtain detonation pressures (P) and velocities (D) by using EXPLO5 program. These new materials exhibit good densities and thermal stabilities, high heats of formation, acceptable detonation properties, and are insensitive to impact.",2014
Unraveling the influence of surface functionalities on gas Physisorption: A comprehensive study on SBA-15 nanoporous material from Monte Carlo simulation for improved Textural-Energetic characterization,"In this study, we conducted experimental and Monte Carlo simulation studies in the grand canonical ensemble (GCMC) to investigate the role of molecular orientation and surface heterogeneity on the adsorption of N 2 at 77 K. Our research focused on a series of ordered nanoporous materials (SBA -15) with varying degrees of oxygen functionalities. Specifically, we examined the effects of surface heterogeneity on the calculation of pore size distribution (PSD) and the BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) area of porous materials. To provide a comprehensive perspective, we compared our results with three levels of surface oxidation, including a pristine case without any surface oxidation. The results from both our experimental and simulation data reveal the importance of chemical heterogeneity in determining equilibrium properties such as molecular packing within the pores, differential enthalpies of adsorption, and N 2 orientation distribution. Our findings suggest that accurate characterization of surface heterogeneity is crucial for understanding gas adsorption in nanoporous materials and for developing better models for predicting their performance in various applications. Moreover, our simulations revealed substantial changes in the molecular orientation of adsorbate particles with increasing surface heterogeneity. This insight provides valuable information about the behavior of molecules within the nanoporous materials, further enhancing our understanding of the complex adsorption processes in these systems.",2024
3-,"As an environmentally friendly energetic group, the azide group can not only control the melting point but also increase the energy of the compound. Therefore, the design and synthesis of energetic compounds with azido groups have long been a focus of research in the field of energetic materials. 3-R-4-(5-methyleneazide-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)furazan energetic materials were synthesized and fully characterized. Using computational chemistry methods, the interactions of some compounds were studied, and the physical and chemical properties of all of compounds were examined. The results show that 3-amino-4-(5-methyleneazide-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)furazan (2) has a melting point similar to that of TNT and can be a potential carrier for molten-cast explosives. Hydroxylamine salt (4) has an excellent detonation velocity and detonation pressure of 9090 m s(-1) and 35.76 GPa, respectively, and its energy is significantly higher than that of RDX, enabling replacement of RDX as a high-energy explosive. Although the detonation performance of compound 4 is slightly lower than that of HMX, its sensitivity is better than that of HMX, which shows that compound 4 still has a high application value. Non-covalent interactions (NCIs) and Hirshfeld surface models indicate that hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions are the key factors that reduce the sensitivity of compounds. Therefore, our results for 3-R-4-(5-methyleneazide-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)furazan energetic materials suggest that it may be competitive for application in both molten-cast explosives and high-energy explosives.",2021
"5,6-Di(2-fluoro-2,2-dinitroethoxy)furazano[3,4-","5,6-Di(2-fluoro-2,2-dinitroethoxy)furazano[3,4-b] pyrazine was synthesized in a three-step process starting from 3,4-diaminofurazan (DAF) including a significant nucleophilic substitution reaction under the catalytic effect of trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate. Characterization of this molecule indicates that it possesses a higher crystal density than that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) at ambient temperature with acceptable melting-point and energetic properties approaching those of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) but with a higher thermal stability and lower sensitivity towards impact and friction.

"From van der Waals interactions to structures and properties of 3,3′-dinitro-5,5′-bis-1,2,4-triazole-1,1′-diolate based energetic materials","As a continuation for the search of precise correlation between performance and sensitivity of high energy density materials (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2018, 20, 29693), we present structure analysis and quantum mechanical calculations for similar energetic Ionic salts (EIS) based on 3,3'-dinitro-5,5'-bis-1,2,4-triazole-1,1-diolate anion with ammonium (DA-DNBTO) and hydrazinium (DH-DNBTO) cations. The geometry optimization demonstrate the importance of van der Waals correction when studying the structure and properties of EIS, and highlights the significance of DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme in reproducing the experimental crystal structures of energetic salts. The IR spectrum of DA-DNBTO contains more number of intense peaks in the high frequency range (above 2850 cm(-1)) compared to DH-DNBTO. Especially, the electronic band gap of DNBTO salts obtained using the HSE06 hybrid functional are reduced to 50% when compared with that of BTO based energetic salts due to NO2 group attached to the DNBTO anion. Besides, we find that the O center dot center dot center dot O contacts that generally exist in most of the energetic materials do not show much impact in both the studied energetic salts. The strong intermolecular interactions of DA-DNBTO represents its inferiority in molecular stability, which is in good agreement with the experimentally measured impact sensitivity (>40 J) and friction sensitivity (360 N) values and also explains why it has highest stability compared to DH-DNBTO. Our calculations re-verifies the importance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the construction of high performance and low sensitive energetic materials.",2020
"Effect of quality of separately collected glass, paper plus cardboard and lightweight packaging waste on environmental, energetic and economic sustainability of the material recovery facility operations","Low-quality materials contained in separately collected (SC) packaging waste generate environmental and economic burdens associated to both sorting operations of Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) and landfilling of non-recyclable materials. In this study, based on quantification of both impurities and recyclable fractions, the quality of SC municipal packaging waste streams was determined by compositional analysis of the waste entering a MRF throughout a year. Foreign materials (% w/w) found in the monitored SC glass, paper plus cardboard and lightweight packaging waste, were on average 5.0, 14.7 and 23.0, respectively, while landfilled materials (% w/ w) after MRF sorting operations were on average 4.3, 10.3 and 22.0, respectively. A Life Cycle Assessment study was conducted to determine the environmental impact of SC packaging waste streams quality of three different scenarios: current situation (CS), better (BS) and ideal (IS) scenario with reduced presence and absence, respectively, of improper materials in the three examined SC packaging waste streams.

The role of microstructure in the impact induced temperature rise in hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) energetic materials using the cohesive finite element method,"In this work, microstructure dependent impact-induced failure of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-cyclo-tetra-methylene-tetra-nitramine (HMX) energetic material samples is studied using the cohesive finite element method (CFEM). The CFEM model incorporates experimentally measured viscoplastic constitutive behavior, experimentally measured interface level separation properties, and phenomenological temperature increase due to mechanical impact based on viscoplastic and frictional energy dissipation. Nanoscale dynamic impact experiments were used to obtain parameters for a strain-rate dependent power law viscoplastic constitutive model in the case of bulk HTPB and HMX as well as the HTPB-HMX interfaces. An in situ mechanical Raman spectroscopy (MRS) setup was used to obtain bilinear cohesive zone model parameters to simulate interface separation. During analyses, the impact-induced viscoplastic energy dissipation and the frictional contact dissipation at the failed HTPB-HMX interfaces is found to have a significant contribution toward local temperature rise. Microstructures having circular HMX particles show a higher local temperature rise as compared to those with diamond or irregularly shaped HMX particles with sharp edges indicating that the specific particle surface area has a higher role in temperature rise than particle shape and sharp edges. Regions within the analyzed microstructures near the HTPB-HMX interfaces with a high-volume fraction of HMX particles were found to have the maximum temperature increase.",2020
"Some molecular/crystalline factors that affect the sensitivities of energetic materials: molecular surface electrostatic potentials, lattice free space and maximum heat of detonation per unit volume","We discuss three molecular/crystalline properties that we believe to be among the factors that influence the impact/shock sensitivities of energetic materials (i.e., their vulnerabilities to unintended detonation due to impact or shock). These properties are (a) the anomalously strong positive electrostatic potentials in the central regions of their molecular surfaces, (b) the free space per molecule in their crystal lattices, and (c) their maximum heats of detonation per unit volume. Overall, sensitivity tends to become greater as these properties increase; however these are general trends, not correlations. Nitramines are exceptions in that their sensitivities show little or no variation with free space in the lattice and heat of detonation per unit volume. We outline some of the events involved in detonation initiation and show how the three properties are related to different ones of these events.",2015
New directions in the science and technology of advanced sheet explosive formulations and the key energetic materials used in the processing of sheet explosives: Emerging trends,"This review presents the work carried out by the international community in the area of sheet explosive formulations and its applications in various systems. The sheet explosive is also named as PBXs and is a composite material in which solid explosive particles like RDX, HMX or PETN are dispersed in a polymeric matrix, forms a flexible material that can be rolled/cut into sheet form which can be applied to any complex contour. The designed sheet explosive must possess characteristic properties such as flexible, cuttable, water proof, easily initiable, and safe handling. The sheet explosives are being used for protecting tanks (ERA), light combat vehicle and futuristic infantry carrier vehicle from different attacking war heads etc. Besides, sheet explosives find wide applications in demolition of bridges, ships, cutting and metal cladding. This review also covers the aspects such as risks and hazard analysis during the processing of sheet explosive formulations, effect of ageing on sheet explosives, detection and analysis of sheet explosive ingredients and the R&D efforts of Indian researchers in the development of sheet explosive formulations.

"Synthesis and Characterization of 2,2′-Dinitramino-5,5′-bi(1-oxa-3,4-diazole) and Derivatives as Economic and Highly Dense Energetic Materials","2,2'-Dinitramino-5,5'-bi(1-oxa-3,4-diazole) (2) is a new highly energetic material with superior calculated detonation performance in comparison to cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene- 2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX) and penta-erythritoltetranitrate (PETN) and can be prepared by an economical and practical two-step synthesis.

"Very thermostable energetic materials based on a fused-triazole: 3,6-diamino-1","3,6-Diamino-1H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazole (1) and its energetic salts (2-9) were designed and synthesized based on a fused-triazole backbone with two C-amino groups as substituents. Their physicochemical and energetic properties were measured or calculated. Among them, compound 1 exhibits superior thermostability (T-d (onset): 261 degrees C), surpassing its analogues 3,7-diamino-7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazole (DATT, 219 degrees C) and 3,6,7-triamino-7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4]triazole (TATOT, 245 degrees C). The differences in thermal stabilities were further investigated by determining the lowest bond dissociation energies (BDE) where a positive correlation between the stability of the molecules and the lowest BDE values is observed. The results show that 1 with the highest value for the lowest BDE has a superior thermostability in comparison to DATT and TATOT. The energetic salts (2-9) also exhibit remarkable thermal stabilities as well as low impact and friction sensitivities.

"Reversible Hydrogen Transfer as New Sensitivity Mechanism for Energetic Materials against External Stimuli: A Case of the Insensitive 2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide","2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-l-oxide (LLM-105) was first synthesized about 20 years ago and is regarded as a representative of the new generation of low-sensitivity energetic materials (EMs). Nevertheless, its thermal decay detail still remains lacking; in particular, the atomistic details of the decomposition of its condensed phase are absent. Thus, this work presents a quantum chemistry based study to reveal the details. Four pathways are found to initiate the primary molecular fission, including the intramolecular H transfer from a NH2 group to its neighboring acyl O atom, the NO2 partition, the acyl O partition, and the O partition from a NO2 group. The dominance of these pathways is strongly temperature-dependent, i.e., the intramolecular H transfer and the NO2 partition govern the initial steps at relatively low and high temperatures, respectively, and both the O partitions each occur once only at high temperature. Furthermore, we find that the intramolecular H transfer takes place always with a low energy barrier, and the H transferred product can also return back to the original molecules with a low barrier too, exhibiting the reversibility of the transfer. More importantly, such reversibility can partly be responsible for the low sensitivity of LLM-10.5, as the reversible H transfer can buffer the external stimuli with an energy transfer and a slight structural variation only, while without disastrous and irretrievable consequence of a series of spontaneous reactions to final products. This work verifies that the reversible H transfer can take place not only intermolecularly in energetic ionic salts but also intramolecularly in neutral energetic molecules to buffer against external stimuli to facilitate low-impact sensitivity.",2018
"Interaction between cis-2 bis(benzofuro)[60]fullerene derivative and gas molecules of energetic materials (NO, NO","To investigate the antioxidant properties of cis-2 bis(benzofuro)[60]fullerene derivative, 42 fully optimized structures on potential energy surface of cis-2 bis(benzofuro)[60]fullerene derivative and gas molecules interaction system have been obtained by adopting the dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) method.

Besides, the adsorption between gas molecules and cis-2 bis (benzofuro)[60]fullerene derivative is stronger than their adsorption with [60]fullerene, so the antioxidant performance of [60]fullerene can be improved by the chemical modification.",2022
"Cocrystal of 4,5′-dinitro-3′","Improving stability is one of the pursuits of exploring energetic materials, and co-crystallization technology is one of the research approaches to achieve this goal.

"Anisotropic shock sensitivity for β-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine energetic material under compressive-shear loading from ReaxFF-","We report here the predictions on anisotropy of shock sensitivity and of chemical process initiation in single crystal beta-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (beta-HMX) using compressive shear reactive dynamics (CS-RD) model with ReaxFF-lg reactive force field. Analysis of resolved shear stress induced by uniaxial compression along three shock directions normal to (110), (011), and (010) planes leads to identify eight slip systems as candidates for shear deformation. For each of the eight slip systems, non-equilibrium reactive dynamics simulations were carried out to determine thermal, mechanical, and chemical responses to shear deformation. Shock direction normal to (010) plane exhibits large shear stress barriers arising from steric hindrance between molecules of adjacent layers leading to local dramatic energy and temperature increases under shear flow that in turn accelerate chemical bond breaking and initial product formation processes, promoting further molecular decomposition and eventually transition to detonation. This suggests that single crystal beta-HMX is sensitive to shocks in direction normal to (010) plane. Shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes reveal significantly less steric hindrance, leading to more modest energy and temperature increases followed by slower chemical reaction initiation. Thus, shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes are less sensitive than shock direction normal to (010) plane, which agree with interpretations from currently available plate impact experiments on HMX. This validation of CS-RD and ReaxFF for characterizing sensitivity of single crystal energetic materials indicates that these methods can be applied to study sensitivity for more complex polymer bonded explosives and solid composite propellants having complex microstructures, corrugated interfaces, as well as defects.

"Effects of pressure on structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of nitrogen-rich energetic material: 6-azido-8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-7-amine (3at)","Context and results6-Azido-8-nitrotetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-7-amine (3at) is a promising green energetic material, which meets the development requirements of environment-friendly explosives. By discussing the relationship between lattice parameters and pressure, it is found that the compression ratio indicates anisotropy of compressibility. And bond lengths get shorter under pressure, resulting in stronger intermolecular bonds. The N-3 group rotates under pressure. And then, the optical properties basically change regularly with the change of pressure. As the pressure increases, the absorption range widens. In the low energy interval, it shows transparency, and then with the increase of energy and pressure, it shows better optical activity. With the increase of pressure and energy, the absorption coefficient increases, representing that the optical activity becomes high. Finally, according to the analysis of mechanical properties, 3at exhibited brittle behavior at 0 GPa and 100 GPa, while at 10 to 90 GPa, the values of nu and B/G are malleable.Computational and theoretical techniquesBased on density functional theory, the crystal parameters, electronic properties, optical properties, and elastic and mechanical properties of 3at under different pressures were studied theoretically.

The relationship between intermolecular interaction and sensitivity as well as thermal stability of the title compound was investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis and fingerprint plot. Its thermodynamic properties were studied by non-isothermal kinetic methods based on the results of differential scanning calorimeter. It is interesting that apparent activation energy (E-a) at T-p1 (210.89-214.17kJmol(-1)) is higher than those at T-p2 (133.90-134.87kJmol(-1)).

"Fabrication of micro/nano spherulitic hierarchical energetic materials via noncrystallographic branching induced by polymer additives: A case study of 2,2?,4,4?,6,6?-hexanitrostilbene (HNS)","In this work, the micro/nano spherulitic hierarchical 2,2 ',4,4 ',6,6 '-hexanitrostilbene (HNS) with the excellent specific surface area was prepared for the first time, which was expected to overcome the agglomeration problems of nanoscale HNS. In detail, poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), polysuccinimide (PSI), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were selected as additives to induce forming spherulitic HNS. Leaflike crystals were obtained in the presence of PNIPAM, while spherulitic HNS could be fabricated in the presence of PSI or PVP. And the prepared spherulitic HNS owned nearly 6 times the specific surface area of the raw HNS, with decreased impact sensitivity and advanced melting and decomposition temperatures, demonstrating a good desensitization effect, and a favorable energy release of the hierarchical structure. Moreover, morphological changes under the effect of the molecular weight and concentration of PVP were explored. The approximated morphological evolution of spherulitic HNS was consistent with the classical spherulitic growth by noncrystallographic branching. Furthermore, it was verified that preferential adsorption of PVP and PSI on the HNS inhibits the growth steps of the (200) face and introduces stress to generate crystal defects, which triggers noncrystallo-graphic branching and further spherulitic growth. Overall, the strategy of fabricating micro/nano spherulitic hierarchical energetic materials via polymer-additive induced noncrystallographic branching is promising to solve the problems of nanoscale energetic materials in agglomeration and microscale bulk crystals in low activity.",2023

On-demand microwave growth of porosity within a granular composite energetic material: Void formation via a dielectric loss phase change binder additive for propellant burning rate control,"This study demonstrates, for the first time ever, the ability to grow, in an on-command fashion, porosity within a granular composite energetic material to effect a change in energy output rate. Specifically, the study investigates the change in burning rates of ammonium perchlorate composite propellants as a result of porosity created in situ via microwave field-driven volatilization of the low boiling point binder additive, ethylene glycol. Theoretical mass densities were measured before and after microwave irradiation finding that the maximum observed %TMD change for tested propellants is 6 %. Propellants were burned at 1.72 MPa to 6.89 MPa pressures, finding that for all propellants, microwave irradiation produced a change in ballistic characteristics. Most propellant formulations demonstrate acceptable burning rate parameters for use within rocket motors; some exhibited a large change in their pressure exponent as well as slope breaks attributed to the onset of convective burning, while microwave irradiation produced no change in burning rate or density in reference propellants without the additive. Microwave heating simulation results are presented to gain insight into the thermal environment of the propellant during microwave irradiation. These results provide valuable insight into propellant formulations that can have their burning rates (and thus the thrust profile for motor grains) altered after casting via microwave irradiation.",2024

Numerical Modeling and Experimental Validation by Calorimetric Detection of Energetic Materials Using Thermal Bimorph Microcantilever Array: A Case Study on Sensing Vapors of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),"Bi-layer (Au-Si3N4) microcantilevers fabricated in an array were used to detect vapors of energetic materials such as explosives under ambient conditions. The changes in the bending response of each thermal bimorph (i.e., microcantilever) with changes in actuation currents were experimentally monitored by measuring the angle of the reflected ray from a laser source used to illuminate the gold nanocoating on the surface of silicon nitride microcantilevers in the absence and presence of a designated combustible species. Experiments were performed to determine the signature response of this nano-calorimeter platform for each explosive material considered for this study. Numerical modeling was performed to predict the bending response of the microcantilevers for various explosive materials, species concentrations, and actuation currents. The experimental validation of the numerical predictions demonstrated that in the presence of different explosive or combustible materials, the microcantilevers exhibited unique trends in their bending responses with increasing values of the actuation current.",2015

"Coupling Effect of Shock, Heat, and Defect on the Decay of Energetic Materials: A Case of Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations on 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane","Multiple types of external stimuli are usually loaded on an energetic material (EM) simultaneously, and thus they have a coupled effect on its decay. Meanwhile, the structures of the EM essentially influence the decay. Thereby, the coupling effects of these stimuli and structures should be considered in assessing the decay and further the safety of EMs. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to clarify the atomistic/molecular details of the coupling effects on the decay and safety mechanisms. In the present work, we perform reactive molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the multiscale shock technique to reveal a shock preheating dislocation coupling effect on the decay mechanism of an energetic representative, 1,3,S-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). That is, three factors including shock velocity, preheating temperature, and edge dislocation are accounted as variables for the simulations. Increasing shock velocity and preheating temperature and presenting edge dislocation in crystal both promote the RDX decay. Preheating enhances the shock sensitivity as ascertained experimentally, and the sensitivity enhancement is caused by the elevated potential energy of the RDX molecules because of preheating. Moreover, interestingly, two different shock-preheating dislocation couplings can possess an equivalent effect on the RDX decay, as they can lead to almost same evolutions of major chemical species, temperature, pressure, and potential energy. All these findings are expected to deepen the insight into the response mechanisms for the EMs against external stimuli, particularly in the case of multiple factors coupled.",2018

Remediation of Surface Soils Contaminated with Energetic Materials by Thermal Processes,"As a result of military training, many range and training areas are contaminated with energetic material.

Effect of Bi,"An effective strategy involving a suitable carrier is needed to improve the dispersion, combustion and catalytic performances of catalyst nanoparticles. Herein, a Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 composite employing g-C3N4 as the catalyst carrier was prepared by a one-step in situ hydrothermal method, which was used as the combustion catalyst of solid propellants. The catalyst's structure, morphology and its catalytic decomposition on several energetic materials were characterized by a series of analyses. The optimal ratio of g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6 was systematically determined. The results demonstrate that Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 (4:6) composite can diminish the decomposition temperatures of ammonium perchlorate (AP), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), dihydroxylammonium 5,5'-bistetrazole-1,1'-diolate (TIOC-50) and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine + nitrocellulose (RDX + NC) by 25.0, 5.2, 24.0 and 1.2 (4.9) degrees C, and reduce their apparent activation energy by 59.5, 116.7, 11.6 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Moreover, the laser ignition tests indicate that Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 can effectively promote the ignition performance of RDX and RDX + NC. A possible mechanism of Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 on AP was proposed. The g-C3N4 catalyst carrier is superior to GO carrier due to its low cost, simple synthesis process, improved combustion and catalytic performances, as well as high N content.

The synthesis of DPT was carried out by the nitration of hexamine based on the lines of reported method with minor modification. DPT was characterized by elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Thermal stability of DPT was studied using thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal analysis studies revealed that DPT undergoes decomposition at 211 degrees C. Decomposition of DPT using TG-FTIR indicated the evolution of carbon dioxide, water and oxides of nitrogen as main gaseous products. The electrochemical behavior of DPT was studied using cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies. The experimentally determined sensitivity parameters indicated the insensitive nature of DPT towards external stimuli. The performance parameters of DPT, RDX and HMX have been computed using Linear Output Thermodynamic User Friendly Software for Energetic Systems (LOTUSES) code.

Superior thermally robust energetic materials featuring ,"A novel nitrogen-rich energetic material, namely 3,5-bis(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazole)-1H-pyrazole, was synthesized via a one-step reaction from commercially available reagents and its single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that the conformational isomerism of this new energetic material was associated with the configuration of pyrazole (trans or cis) as a cation in the presence of two Hofmeister anions. Their structures were fully determined via H-1, C-13 NMR, and infrared spectroscopies as well as elementary analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was employed for characterizing their crystal structures. It is worth noting that the detonation velocity and sensitivity (D: 9275 m s(-1), IS > 40 J, FS = 360 N) of 3,5-bis(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazole)-1H-pyrazole (EM3) are superior to those of RDX. Meanwhile, 3,5-bis(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazole)-1H-pyrazole and its supramolecular assembly energetic materials (EM3-EM5) exhibit great thermal stability (T-d: 280-358 degrees C), suggesting that they are also heat-resistant energetic materials. The above-mentioned energetic performances show that they are insensitive and have further potential applications as metal-free detonating substances.",2020
Lithium-Promoted Formation of M-2AZTO-Li (M=N2H5+or NH3OH+and AZTO = Anion of 1-Hydroxytetrazole-5-hydrazide)-Type ?Quaternary? Complexes with Nitrogen-Rich Characteristics: Construction of Novel Insensitive Energetic Materials,"tant research objects in the field of high-energy materials. However, the weak coordination abilities of lithium ions relative to those of other metal ions with greater atomic numbers have hindered their applications in the field of nitrogen-rich complexes. Herein, we successfully prepared novel lithium-based nitrogen-rich complexes (N2H5-2AZTO-Li and NH3OH-2AZTO-Li) by exploiting the structural properties of 1-hydroxytetrazolium-5hydrazine (HAZTO). Both N2H5-2AZTO-Li and NH3OH2AZTO-Li were found to exhibit physicochemical parameters (including the density, stability, and energetic properties) that were intermediate between those of the simple ionic compounds (3 and 4) and the complexes (5) that formed them, enabling a favorable balance between high energy, high stability, and environmental friendliness (for N2H5-2AZTO-Li: detonation velocity (D) = 9005 m s-1, detonation pressure (P) = 35.5 GPa, decomposition temperature (Tdec) = 238.1 degrees C, impact sensitivity (IS) = 24 J, friction sensitivity (FS) = 210 N, and detonation product (DP) (CO) < 2%; for NH3OH-2AZTO-Li: D = 9028 m s-1, P = 35.7 GPa, Tdec = 211.2 degrees C, IS = 20 J, FS = 180 N, and DP (CO) < 2%). This study transcends the conventional structural forms of nitrogenrich complexes, opening new horizons for the design of novel insensitive energetic materials.",2023
"Macro-scale sensitivity through meso-scale hotspot dynamics in porous energetic materials: Comparing the shock response of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX)","The sensitivity of an energetic material is strongly influenced by its microstructure. This work distinguishes the roles played by the microstructure (i.e., the meso-scale) in the macro-scale shock sensitivity of two different materials: TATB and HMX. To quantify sensitivity, we develop a meso-informed energy deposition model for a porous TATB material, following procedures from the previous work on HMX. Simulations of reactive void collapse in TATB are employed to calculate the rate of initiation and growth of hotspots. These rates are expressed as surrogate models, expressing meso-scale (hotspot) quantities of interest as functions of shock strength P s and void size D v o i d. The hotspot ignition and growth rate surrogates for TATB are compared with those for HMX, providing insights into meso-scale physics underlying shock sensitivity of these two energetic materials. The surrogate models are then used in a meso-informed ignition and growth (MES-IG) model to close macro-scale simulations of the shock response of porous TATB. We also obtain the run-to-detonation distances and generate Pop-plots to quantify macro-scale sensitivity. It is shown that Pop-plots for HMX-based energetic materials accord with behavior observed in experimental studies; however, there is a significant discrepancy between MES-IG predictions and experiments for TATB; the causes for this difference between HMX and TATB are discussed, pointing to areas for future work.",2020
"Host-guest energetic materials: a promising strategy of incorporating small insensitive molecule into the lattice cavities of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane to enhance the safety on the premise of maintaining the excellent energy density","Crystal density is one of the crucial properties that should be pursued in developing novel high energy density materials (HEDMs) since it can obviously affect the detonation performance of energetic materials. However, the dense packing of sensitive HEDM molecules can seriously increase the unpleasant mechanical sensitivity. Here, the host-guest intermolecular explosives showed a promising potential to resolve this inherent contradiction of famous high explosive 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW) by self-assembly with insensitive methanoic acid (MA) under environmental conditions. Based on the perfect space matching between MA and lattice cavities of HNIW, the crystallographic density of HNIW-MA has exceeded the gold standard regarding the density of HEDMs and was determined to be 2.003 g cm(-3) at 296 K. More importantly, the safety performance of HNIW-MA was improved while maintaining high crystal density due to the regulation by a small amount of insensitive guest molecules. Experimental results have shown the H-50 of HNIW-MA was 20.8 cm, which is significantly higher than that of alpha-HNIW of 14.8 cm and epsilon-HNIW of <14.1 cm.",2022
"Theoretical Screening of Novel 5-picrylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrazole (PAT) and 5,5-styphnylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrazole (SAT) Derivatives: A New Molecular Design Strategy of Multi-Nitrogen Energetic Materials by Introducing Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds and - Stacking Interactions","On the basis of a design strategy that results in the introduction of intramolecular hydrogen-bonds and - stacking interactions leading to low-sensitive and high-energy materials (LSHMs), -NH2/-NO2 fused derivatives of 5-picrylamino- 1,2,3,4-tetrazole (PAT) and 5,5-styphnylamino- 1,2,3,4-tetrazole (SAT) were designed and investigated theoretically. Density functional theory has been explored to investigate the geometric, electronic structures, band gaps, and heats of formation. The detonation performance was evaluated by using Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on the calculated densities and enthalpy of formation (EOF). The thermal stability of these compounds was studied by calculating bond dissociation energies and energy gaps. Proper numbers of 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT) moieties can enhance the EOFs of explosives, further improving the detonation performance as well as nitro group. Though introducing more nitro-groups into TATB frameworks, NH-moieties can retain the intramolecular hydrogen-bond, which can enhance the crystal-packing and physico-chemical stability. Meanwhile, noncovalent interaction (NCI) plots reflects that intermolecular interaction also has a crucial influence on the mechanical sensitivity for the designed derivatives, except for the energy gap (E) and bond dissociation energy (BDE). UV/Vis spectra and N-15 isotropic magnetic shielding were further computed for characterizing and predicting the molecular structure and reaction mechanism towards the future experiments. The predicted performance implies that the designed molecules are expected to be promising candidates for multi-nitrogen energetic materials.",2017
"Prediction of structures and properties of 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO) and 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO3N) green energetic materials from DFT and ReaxFF molecular modeling","2,4,6-Triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO) and 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO3N) were suggested by Klapotke et al. as candidates for green high energy density materials (HEDM), but a successful synthesis has not yet been reported. In order to predict the properties of these systems, we used quantum mechanics (PBE flavor of density functional theory) to predict the most stable conformations of MTO and MTO3N and their optimum packing into the most stable crystal structures. We found that MTO has the P2(1) space-group with a density of rho = 1.92 g cm(3) while MTO3N has the P21/c space-group with a density of rho = 2.10 g cm(-3). The heats of reaction (DHrxn) were computed to be 1036 kcal kg(-1) for MTO, 1412 kcal kg(-1) for MTO3N, and 1653 kcal kg(-1) for a mixture of them. These properties are comparable to those of such other useful energetic materials as RDX (rho = 1.80 g cm(-3), Delta H-rxn - 1266 kcal kg(-1)), HMX, and PETN, making MTO and MTO3N excellent candidates for environmentally friendly HEDMs. In addition, we predicted the stability of -NH2, -NO, and -NO2 groups in water solution. We also show that the ReaxFF-lg reactive FF leads to an accurate description of the structural properties of MTO and MTO3N crystals making it practical to carry out large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations practical for these systems to determine the sensitivity and performance (CJ point calculation and velocity) under shear, shock, and thermal loads.",2016
"Reaction mechanism from quantum molecular dynamics for the initial thermal decomposition of 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO) and 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO3N), promising green energetic materials","Klapotke and co-workers recently designed two new materials, 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO) and 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-trioxide (MTO3N), envisioned as candidates for green high-energy materials. However, all attempts at synthesis have failed. In order to validate the expected properties for these systems and to determine why these materials are too unstable to synthesize, we used the PBE flavor of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict the crystal structures for MTO and MTO3N and then we carried out DFT molecular dynamics simulations (DFT-MD) to determine the initial reaction mechanisms for decomposition. Klapotke estimated that MTO would have a density of rho = 1.859 g cm(-3) with an estimated detonation velocity (D-v) of 8.979 km s(-1), making it comparable to RDX (rho = 1.82 g cm(-3), D-v = 8.75 km s(-1)) and beta-HMX (rho = 1.91 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.10 km s(-1)). His estimated impact sensitivity >30 J, make it much better than HMX (7 J) and RDX (7.5 J). Our predicted crystal structure for MTO (P2((1)) space group) leads to rho = 1.859 g cm(-3), in good agreement with expectations. Our DFT-MD studies find that the first step in the decomposition of MTO is intermolecular hydrogen-transfer reaction (barrier 3.0 kcal mol(-1)) which is followed quickly by H2O and NO release with reaction barriers of 46.5 and 35.5 kcal mol(-1). In contrast for MTO3N (P2((1))/(c) predicted space group), we find that the first steps are a bimolecular decomposition to release NO2 (Delta H = 44.1 kcal mol(-1), Delta G = 54.7 kcal mol(-1)) simultaneous with unimolecular NO2 cleavage (Delta H = 59.9 and Delta G = 58.2 kcal mol(-1)) a unique initial reaction among EMs. These results suggest that MTO3N would be significantly more thermally stabile (barrier > 6.0 kcal mol(-1) higher) than RDX and HMX, making it an excellent candidate to be insensitive new green energetic materials. However we find that MTO leads to very favorable hydrogen transfer reactions that may complicate synthesis and crystallization, making MTO3N the more promising system.",2015
Theoretical investigation of reactive burn in a highly cracked energetic material,"While energetic material reactive burn processes such as the buildup to detonation are well understood for energetic materials like PBX 9501 that contain small amounts of porosity, the same is not true for highly cracked energetic materials. This work addresses this shortcoming by performing theoretical reactive burn calculations where thin submillimeter thick cracks permeating a PBX 9501 system are explicitly modeled. We use the Scaled Uniform Reactive Flow (SURF) model for the reactive burn calculations. Before considering highly cracked structures, we first show that SURF closely reproduces reactive burn experiments done on pristine and single air gap PBX 9501. For all cases of this investigation, a highpressure shock is introduced by way of a high velocity impact to initiate a detonation in our cracked PBX 9501 structures. Using fully three-dimensional simulations and the physics code PAGOSA, we investigate the reactive burn process in cracked structures that have a propensity to have cracks either aligned with or orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation. While each crack structure has the same net crack porosity, we demonstrate that the reactive burn produced differs for the two cases. We also provide crack structure metrics, beyond porosity, that characterize the average crack orientation relative to the direction of wave propagation. Simulation results are provided for several variants of cracked structures. At the highest crack porosity studied here we observed the breakdown of stable detonation propagation. This high porosity case was achieved by doubling the average crack width, leaving all other features of the crack network unchanged. We conclude with a synthesis of our simulation observations to make general comments regarding how crack networks can affect points on the PBX 9501 detonation pop plot.

"Quest for Green Energetic Materials, Green Rocket Fuels and Polyiodo Biocides","The design of more powerful and greener explosives is an ongoing major concern in the energetic materials community. After examining azoles from pyrazole to pentazole as a basis for new energetic materials, the tetrazole ring seems to be a good compromise between high performance and low sensitivity. Keeping this in mind, we synthesized a family of new nitrogen-rich energetic tetrazoles, di(1 H -tetrazol-5-yl)methanoneoxime and 5,5’-(hydrazonomethylene)bis(1 H -tetrazole), in very good yields from inexpensive starting materials. By taking advantage of the acidity of these compounds, syntheses of nitrogen-rich energetic salts was possible. Hypergolic ionic liquids tend to have low volatilities and high thermal and chemical stabilities, and often exhibit wide liquid ranges which could allow the use of these substances as bipropellant fuels under a variety of conditions. Borohydride ionic liquids are known for their short ignition delay times and wide liquid ranges; however, previously they were often synthesized by using toxic and expensive liquid ammonia and additionally, they are also sensitive to moisture. Now, we synthesized eight tetrahydroborate compounds using an efficient synthetic method which does not require liquid ammonia and which leads to improved hydrolytic stability of the borohydride compounds by an imaginative construction of the imidazolium cation. Current methods for the iodination of pyrazoles suffer from a variety of difficulties such as requiring use of large quantities of reactants yielding mixtures of compounds in low yields. Because of the lack of good synthetic routes, the chemistry and properties of polyiodopyrazoles have not been studied widely. Now we report an efficient synthetic route to polyiodopyrazoles employing trifluoroperacetic acid. A variety of polyiodo compounds including 3,4,5-triiodopyrazole was synthesized in good yields. The decomposition products of these materials were determined by employing Cheetah 6 calculations. Trifluoroperacetic acid-mediated electrophillic iodination was also utilized with benzimidazoles. The new polyiodo benzimidazoles proved to be very good starting materials in the preparation of novel energetic materials. Among the two triazole isomers, i.e., 1,2,3-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole, the former has favorable energy content for construction of energetic molecules. Therefore, we explored mono and diiodo 1,2,3-triazoles for their biocidal promise.",2016

The achievable contrast and spatial resolutions are considered, with arguments relating to destructive and non-destructive methods of acquiring data. The eventual use of this work will be in computational modelling.",2012
"Polynitro-1,2,4-triazole Energetic Materials with ","Trinitromethyl and N-amino groups were innovatively incorporated into the framework of 1,2,4-triazole, resulting in 1-amino-5-nitro-3-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazole (2). Ammonium and hydrazinium salts of 1-amino-5-nitro-3-(dinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazole were synthesized by acidification, extraction, and neutralization with bases from the potassium salt. All of the newly prepared energetic compounds were comprehensively characterized by using infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 2 exhibits favorable properties such as positive oxygen balance (OBCO2 = 5.8%), high density (1.88 g cm-1), good detonation performances (vD = 8937 m s-1, P = 35.5 GPa), and appropriate friction sensitivity (FS = 144 N). The potassium salt 3 demonstrates good thermal decomposition temperature (181 °C) and high density (1.98 g cm-1), while the ammonium salt and hydrazinium salt also display good thermal decomposition temperatures of 183 and 176 °C, respectively. Among these compounds, the ammonium salt exhibits the lowest mechanical sensitivities (FS = 144 N, IS = 6 J).",p-18
Modelling multi-scale material growth and erosion under energetic atomic deposition,"We study crystalline surface evolution in extreme environments, where high-energy atoms impinge on a crystalline surface to cause sputtering, growth and surface roughening. For our model system, we study the evolution of the Ni(111) surface under Ni atom bombardment, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and a Sutton-Chen force field, where the uppermost surface layers are free to move, supported by thermostatically controlled layers above a rigid template. The MD statistics of sputtering and sticking are used to aid the development of a computationally efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) code. Comparisons between the simulation surface morphologies are used to tune the KMC growth rules so that the key statistical features of the MD structures are captured by the KMC model. This model is then employed to explore the predicted behaviour over length and times scales much larger than those accessible to MD. While the MD-KMC approach is well known, this application to the complex surface growth encountered in energetic atomic bombardment illuminates the complexities of relating atomistic events to morphological evolution. The work shows how simulation methodology can be extended to provide predictive capabilities, paving the way for design tools for engineering processes such as plasma deposition film growth.",2022

Application of Twin Screw Extrusion for Continuous Processing of Energetic Materials,"Continuous processing of energetic materials using a twin screw extruder is gaining importance as it is a safe and cost-effective alternative to conventional batch processing. The continuous process based on a twin screw extruder combines the capabilities of intensive mixing and high pressure extrusion. It is used for processing a variety of energetic materials, such as gun and rocket propellants, plastic bonded explosives, pyrotechnics, thermo-baric explosives, etc. The twin screw extruder process demands various safety features for the processing of energetic materials. Therefore, exhaustive characterisation of the energetic materials in terms of safety and rheology, coupled with characterisation of the mechanical components of the extruder, are essential for designing a safe continuous process. In this article, a technological overview of continuous processing for energetic materials is presented, along with its various features, process design methodology and safety issues.",2015
The Outlook for the Use of Pseudopolymorphic Solvates in Energetic Materials,"An analysis of the ballistic characteristics of propellants based on energetic pseudopolymorphic solvates has been performed. It is shown that the ballistic efficiency of solid composite propellants containing gamma-HMX or alpha-CL-20 can be improved considerably by means of the introduction of small molecules into the structural cavities present in the crystal structures of these polymorphs. This effect may appear when small molecules (e.g. water, hydrazine, ethanol) enter into the crystal structure of the main component with no changes in the lattice parameters of the latter.",2014

Exchange of the sulphate and chloride anions in compounds 1 and 2 by energetic anions yielded to the formation of energetic salts based on the 2,2-dimethyltriazanium cation [(CH3)(2)N(NH2)(2)](+) on one hand and azide (5), 5-aminotetrazolate (6), 5-nitrotetrazolate (7) and 5,5'-azobistetrazolate (8) anions on the other hand.

Computational survey of representative energetic materials as propellants for microthruster applications,"Microthrusters are critical for the development of terrestrial micromissiles and nano air vehicles for reconnaissance, surveillance, and sensor emplacement. With the maturation of MEMS manufacturing technology, the physical components of the thrusters can be readily fabricated. The thruster type that is the most straightforward is chemical combustion of a propellant that is ignited by a heating element giving a single shot thrust. Arrays of MEMS manufactured thrusters can be ganged to give multiple firings. The basic model for such a system is a solid rocket motor. The desired elements for the propellant of a chemical thruster are high specific impulse (I-sp), high temperature and pressure, and low molecular weight combustion gases. Since the combustion chamber of a microthruster is extremely small, the propellant material must be able to ignite, sustain and complete its bum inside the chamber. The propellant can be either a solid or a liquid. There are a large number of energetic materials available as candidates for a propellant for microthrusters. There has been no systematic evaluation of the available energetic materials as propellant candidates for microthrusters. This report summarizes computations done on a series of energetic materials to address their suitabilities as microthruster propellants.",2007
An Alternative Approach for Predicting the Shelf Life of Energetic Materials,"The shelf life of energetic materials (EMs) is directly associated with safety and functionality. Therefore, a priori knowledge of this parameter is essential. The standard approach for predicting the shelf life of EMs is tremendously time and money consuming. It involves massive accelerated aging tests at temperatures typically between 40 and 80 & DEG;C for relatively long time periods-from months to years-with different aging time intervals, followed by analysis of the aging-induced changes. A subsequent kinetic analysis with Arrhenius evaluation provides the effective activation energy for calculating shelf life at lower storage temperatures. In this work, a much less time- and resource-intensive approach based on the kinetic analysis of decomposition data gathered by using thermal analysis techniques is discussed as a possible alternative for the shelf life prediction of EMs. The discussion is placed in the context of the few but promising works of literature on the subject that provide evidence and examples. On the path towards the practical application of this approach, the definition of procedures that allow for a realistic simulation of storage conditions not only in the accelerated aging tests-still needed but limited to the validation of the decomposition kinetics-but also in the thermal analysis experiments is highlighted as one of the main issues to be addressed.",2023
Characterization of Inkjet Printed High Nitrogen Energetic Materials and Bilayer Nanothermite,"This thesis presents work on two major areas of research. The first area of research involves the use of a dual-nozzle piezoelectric inkjet printing system to print bilayer aluminum bismuth (III) oxide nanothermite samples. The combinatorial printing method allows for separate fuel and oxidizer inks to be printed adjacent to each other at prescribed offset distances. The effect of the bilayer thickness on the burning rate of the samples is investigated using high-speed imaging. Analysis of the burning rate data revealed that there is no statistically significant relationship between these two parameters. This result was used to determine the dominant processes that control the propagation rate in nanothermite systems. It was concluded that convective processes dominate the burning rate rather than diffusive processes. The second area of research involved synthesizing inks suitable for inkjet printing using two promising high nitrogen energetic materials called BTATz and DAATO3.5. The performance of the developed inks was characterized using four experiments. The thermal stability and exothermic behavior of the inks were determined using DSC and TGA analysis. The results revealed that the inks are more thermally stable than the base materials. The inks were used to print lines that were subsequently used to determine burning rates. DAATO3.5 samples were determined to have faster burning rates than BTATz. Closed pressure bomb experiments were conducted to determine the gas producing capability of the high nitrogen inks. BTATz samples showed better performance in terms of peak static pressures and pressurization rates. 3D printed microthrusters were developed to test the thrust performance of the inks. Peak thrust, total impulse, and specific impulse values are reported and were determined to be suitable for use with Class 1 micro-spacecraft. Finally, a microthruster array prototype was developed to demonstrate the capability to use additive manufacturing to create high packing density arrays.",2019
On AlO Emission Spectroscopy as a Diagnostic in Energetic Materials Testing,"The emission of AlO is commonly observed in tests involving aluminum combustion in propellants and explosives. Such emission has been used as a signature of combustion, as a tool for measuring ignition and reaction times, and as a thermometer. This paper provides a critical review of methodologies exploiting AlO emission spectroscopy as a quantitative tool in energetics testing. Controlled tests involving aluminized explosives, as well as those using added alumina, are conducted, in which AlO emission is quantified and compared to total oxidation in the final residue. Experimental parameters such as optical depth and fireball confinement are systematically varied to examine the effect on AlO emission. We find that thermometry using AlO remains valid, and a new approach to using low resolution spectra is proposed. However, AlO emission spectroscopy or photometry can be quantitatively correlated to ignition and burning time, or used to infer the presence or absence of aluminum combustion, only under a limited set of circumstances. Factors that limit the ability to use AlO emission quantitatively are discussed in depth.",2013
The Art of Framework Construction: Core-Shell Structured Micro-Energetic Materials,"Weak interfacial interactions remain a bottleneck for composite materials due to their weakened performance and restricted applications. The development of core-shell engineering shed light on the preparation of compact and intact composites with improved interfacial interactions. This review addresses how core-shell engineering has been applied to energetic materials, with emphasis upon how micro-energetic materials, the most widely used particles in the military field, can be generated in a rational way. The preparation methods of core-shell structured explosives (CSEs) developed in the past few decades are summarized herein. Case studies on polymer-, explosive- and novel materials-based CSEs are presented in terms of their compositions and physical properties (e.g., thermal stability, mechanical properties and sensitivity). The mechanisms behind the dramatic and divergent properties of CSEs are also clarified. A glimpse of the future in this area is given to show the potential for CSEs and some suggestions regarding the future research directions are proposed.",2021
High-substitute nitrochitosan used as energetic materials: Preparation and detonation properties,"In order to develop new high-energy materials utilizing natural products, a high-substitute nitrochitosan was prepared with different methods. Prepared processes and detonation properties of the nitrochitosan samples were systematically studied. The nitration substitute degree, nitrogen content, exothermic decomposition enthalpy, heat of combustion, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity and detonation pressure of the prepared highsubstitute nitrochitosan were 2.01, 16.67 %, -2226 J g(-1),- 7831.6 +/- 116.3 J g(-1), > 14.2 J, 7.81 km s(-1) , and 24.03 GPa, respectively. Compared with nitrocellulose (NC), the nitrogen content, impact sensitivity and detonation properties of the prepared nitrochitosan were significantly improved. Nitrochitosan and RDX can form a uniform composite in acetone. With the increase of RDX content, the impact sensitivity of composite increased, but the composite was more stable and not easy to decompose. High-substitute nitrochitosan presents a potential application in solid propellants.",2020
Amino-tetrazole functionalized fused triazolo-triazine and tetrazolo-triazine energetic materials,"The synthesis of two fused high-nitrogen compounds and their energetic salts is presented. All new compounds were well characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and elemental analysis. Some of them (5-8, and 11) were further determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. With high nitrogen contents (59.6-76.8%) and tremendous ring-strain energy, these fused compounds exhibit high positive heats of formation ranging from 2.35 to 4.23 kJ g(-1), much higher than those of RDX (0.32 kJ g(-1)) and HMX (0.25 kJ g(-1)). The high enthalpies and extensive noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interaction) impart them with promising detonation performance. Their energetic performance was evaluated using EXPLO5. Among them, compounds 7, 10, and 11 exhibit high densities, good detonation properties, and excellent mechanical stabilities, thereby highlighting their potential applications as new insensitive energetic materials.",2019
Trigger bond analysis of nitroaromatic energetic materials using wiberg bond indices,"The identification of trigger bonds, bonds that break to initiate explosive decomposition, using computational methods could help direct the development of novel, green and efficient high energy density materials (HEDMs). Comparing bond densities in energetic materials to reference molecules using Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) provides a relative scale for bond activation (%WBIs) to assign trigger bonds in a set of 63 nitroaromatic conventional energetic molecules. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions enhance contributions of resonance structures that strengthen, or deactivate, the CNO2 trigger bonds and reduce the sensitivity of nitroaniline-based HEDMs. In contrast, unidirectional hydrogen bonding in nitrophenols strengthens the bond to the hydrogen bond acceptor, but the phenol lone pairs repel and activate an adjacent nitro group. Steric effects, electron withdrawing groups and greater nitro dihedral angles also activate the CNO2 trigger bonds. %WBIs indicate that nitro groups within an energetic molecule are not all necessarily equally activated to contribute to initiation. %WBIs generally correlate well with impact sensitivity, especially for HEDMs with intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and are a better measure of trigger bond strength than bond dissociation energies (BDEs). However, the method is less effective for HEDMs with significant secondary effects in the solid state. Assignment of trigger bonds using %WBIs could contribute to understanding the effect of intramolecular interactions on energetic properties. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018
Applying machine learning techniques to predict the properties of energetic materials,"We present a proof of concept that machine learning techniques can be used to predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now, candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods - sum over bonds, custom descriptors, Coulomb matrices, Bag of Bonds, and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum over bonds ( bond counting), and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set, we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosive energy, heat of formation, density, and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with approximate to 300 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower, although the convergence with number of molecules is slow. Our work paves the way for future applications of machine learning in this domain, including automated lead generation and interpreting machine learning models to obtain novel chemical insights.",2018
Modeling of Controlled Combustion of High-Energetic Materials on Structured Catalysts,"A mathematical model of combustion of high-energetic materials on structured catalysts is developed. Numerical studies are performed for combustion of a typical material: aminoguanidine nitrate. An increase in catalytic activity, as well as an increase in the thermal conductivity of the catalyst, is found to expand the range of real-time controlling of the burning rate of the condensed substance.",2008
Viscous shear flow and heating of impact-extruded composite energetic materials,"Investigating the macroscopic deformation and localized heating behaviors of high-ductility composite energetic material (CEM) under impact extrusion is crucial to understand the accidental ignition phenomenon of CEM charged weapon systems with structural defects and design the advanced safe munitions. In this study, the rapid viscous shear flow and ignition responses of impact-extruded CEM are first experimentally studied and then simulated using a physically based thermomechanical model. The experimental results show that CEM sample impacted by a 6 kg and -2 m/s falling drop-weight could be extruded into the narrow crack with a high flow speed (-20 m/s) and ignited. A thermomechanical model is developed to describe the continuum viscoelasticplastic deformation and localized heating due to viscoplastic deformation in solid material, viscous flow in melted liquid and chemical reaction. By simulation, a semicircular extrusion region with a shear concentration is formed in CEM sample above the crack, and high shear stress and strain rate at this region contributes to the localized viscous shear heating and ignition of CEM. The effects of the diameter ratio between crack and sample (0.1-0.4) on dynamic responses of CEM are further investigated. The simulated main features of CEM sample, including flow history into the crack, ignition time and location, are consistent with the experimental observations.",2023
Solid Energetic Material Based on Aluminum Micropowder Modified by Microwave Radiation,"The paper discusses the application of pulsed microwave radiation for the modification of crystalline components of a high-energy material (HEsM). The model aluminized mixture with increased heat of combustion was studied. The mixture contained 15 wt.% aluminum micron powder, which was modified by microwave irradiation. It was found that the HEM thermogram has an exo-effect with the maximum at 364.3 degrees C. The use of a modified powder in the HEM composition increased the energy release during combustion by 11% from 5.6 kJ/g to 6.2 kJ/g. The reason for this effect is the increase in the reactivity of aluminum powder after microwave irradiation. In this research, we confirmed that the powders do not lose the stored energy, even as part of the HEM produced on their basis. A laser projection imaging system with brightness amplification was used to estimate the speed of combustion front propagation over the material surface. Measurement of the burning rate revealed a slight difference in the burning rates of HEMs based on irradiated and non-irradiated aluminum micropowders. This property can be demanded in practice, allowing a greater release of energy while maintaining the volume of energetic material.",2022
"Solubility Determination of Raw Energetic Materials in Molten 2,4-Dinitroanisole","2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN) is an ingredient used in several insensitive munition formulations that have recently been qualified by the US Army. A phenomenon known as irreversible growth is found to occur during conditioning cycles of insensitive munitions (IM) that contain DNAN. A possible cause of the irreversible growth maybe the potential solubility of energetic components formulated with melted DNAN. This report documents methods development and procedures used to determine the solubility of energetic constituents in molten DNAN at 100 degrees C. High performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography were used for quantitation. Solubilities (given as g energetic per 100 g DNAN) of RDX, HMX, NTO, NQ, and AP were found as 13.7, 3.02, 0.222, 0.448, and 0.088, respectively.",2014
Characterization of the Energetic Impact of Electrosprayed Nanodroplets on Inert Materials,"The energetic bombardment of covalently bonded materials by electrosprayed nanodroplets causes sputtering, topographic changes and amorphization of the target's surface. The goal of this thesis is to investigate these phenomena using a variety of semiconductor materials and dielectric liquids. The electrosprays are characterized via time-of-flight spectrometry to determine the nanodroplet charge-to-mass ratio which, together with the acceleration voltage, yield the impact velocity, stagnation pressure, and kinetic energy of the projectiles. The damage caused by the beams on the surfaces of single-crystal targets such as Si, SiC, InAs, InP, Ge, GaAs, GaSb and GaN is characterized with different tools including a mechanical profilometer, an atomic force microscope, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, measuring the sputtering yield (ejected atoms per projectile's molecule), sputtering rate, surface roughness, and the morphology of the surface affected by the beam. These figures of merit are quantified in terms of the projectile's size, molecular mass and kinetic energy. Nanodroplets are efficient sputtering projectiles, with maximum sputtering yields of 11.5 and 25.1 for the technological important but difficult to etch SiC and GaN. The maximum sputtering rates for SiC, GaN and GaSb are 720, 1750 and 2380nm/min. The surface roughness and sputtering yields typically increase with the projectile's kinetic energy for all targets, and exhibit sharp maxima for nanodroplets with high molecular mass. The very different sputtering by droplets that are macroscopically similar, and the strong dependence of the impact phenomenology on molecular mass, indicate that nanodroplet sputtering is intrinsically a molecular scale phenomenon, dominated by the transfer of energy under non equilibrium conditions, and hence not amenable to modeling with a continuum formulation. For the case of single-crystal silicon the influence of the projectile's velocity on amorphization is studied. The impacts of nanodroplets on a single-crystal silicon wafer at kinetic energies exceeding a threshold amorphatize a thin superficial layer, of thickness comparable to the droplet diameter. This thesis contributes to develop a new generation of energetic projectile sources in a previously unavailable particle size range, producing beams which can be electrostatically focused into submicrometric spots, similar to focused ion beams, or multiplexed for broad-beam batch fabrication.",2014
Rapid-heating of energetic materials using a micro-differential scanning calorimeter,"A micro-differential scanning calorimeter (mu-DSC) was employed to study the thermal decomposition of organic energetic materials at high heating rates. Heating rates from 1900 to 65,000 K/s were explored, which are many orders of magnitude higher than traditional DSC, but much closer to the conditions these materials would experience in their application. Temperature calibration was done by heating Sn. KNO3, and KClO4 at the desired heating rates to determine the temperature profile at each rate. The samples studied were 5-amino-1H-tetrazole, 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-tetrazolium dinitramide, 1,5-diamino-4-methyl-1H-tetrazolium dinitramide, and 1,5-diamino-4-methyl-1H-tetrazolium azide, which comprise a new class of high-nitrogen containing energetic materials. Activation energies determined using the Kissinger method, are much lower than those reported for the same materials under low heating rates indicating that other decomposition mechanisms are in play at high heating rates.

Energetic Performance of Natural Building Materials: Numerical Simulation and Experimental Evaluation,"The current goal of the European Commission, which aims to reduce CO2 by 90% compared to values estimated in 1980, and the ever-increasing sensitivity to environmental sustainability, fully involve the construction sector, which, according to the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development) is responsible for over one-third of the world's energy requirement. In this frame, numerous researchers and companies are focusing on ecologically sustainable building materials, to be used in new and existing buildings, that are able to simultaneously fulfill the constructive function and improve the energy behavior of the building envelope. The goal of the present paper is the analysis of the energy performance of some innovative locally produced natural building materials (timber, sheep wool, rammed earth, lime-based plaster, natural fibers) used in multilayer vertical closures, compared to that of more common building materials (bricks, concrete, synthetic insulation). First, the physical-mechanical characterization of the local natural materials was carried out, then the model of a building was implemented, whose energetic performance was simulated by varying the type of stratigraphy of the walls, including the use of both innovative and common materials. The building chosen for the simulation consists of one of the BESTEST ANSI/ASHRAE reported in the 140-2017 standard using the climatic data of the Mediterranean area. The results of the simulation have been presented and discussed.",2024
Enhancing the Ignition and Combustion Performance of Metal-based Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials consisting of a fuel and oxidizer are capable of rapidly releasing large amounts of energy through their redox reaction. These materials have a broad range of applications ranging from solid rocket propellants and explosives to heat generators. Metal (e.g., silicon (Si), boron (B), and aluminum (Al))-based energetic materials are attractive due to their high volumetric and gravimetric energy densities. However, these materials exhibit slow energy release rates and are difficult to ignite, preventing them from being leveraged for their superior energy densities in these applications. In this dissertation, three approaches are developed for lowering the ignition threshold and improving the energy release rates of metal-based energetic materials. One approach utilizes the optical flash ignition method which can achieve distributed ignition of energetic materials to reduce ignition threshold and enhance energy release rates. Another approach is to add a metal oxide that supplies additional oxygen to improve oxygen diffusion rates to the fuel so to enhance energy release rates. Finally, creating a unique core/shell nanostructure increases intimate contact, along with a modified micro-emulsion method reduces particle agglomeration, increasing the energy release rates of metal-based energetic materials. First, the optical flash ignition of Si particles is examined, and complementary experimental and numerical studies unveil the impact of particle size and porosity on the ignition properties. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is presented, which details the role of the porosity of the Si particle bed in reducing the minimum radiant fluence for ignition. Five common metal oxides (CuO, Bi2O 3 , MoO 3 , Co 3 O4, and Fe 2 O 3 ) are then surveyed as candidate oxidizers for improving the combustion characteristics of Boron particles, and it is found that binary oxide mixtures (CuO + Bi2O 3 ) are more effective at promoting combustion characteristics of B particles than a single metal oxide. Though these metal oxide mixtures substantially improve the combustion performance of metal fuels, challenges in obtaining homogeneous mixtures and interfacial contact between fuels and oxidizers are prevalent. As a potential solution, we report synthesis and ignition studies of fuel and metal oxide systems (Si/Fe 2 O 3 ) with a unique core/shell structure, which drastically lowers the ignition threshold compared to the traditionally mechanically mixed Si/Fe 2 O 3 . Finally, a modified micro-emulsion method is detailed here, which incorporates particle surface functionalization and pre-dispersion to achieve uniform distribution and contact between an aluminum fuel and polyvinylidene fluoride oxidizer (Al/PVDF). The fluoro-based oxidizer provides an advantage of higher oxidation potential, but Al fuel typically suffers from substantial agglomeration within fluoro-based oxidizers. The novel modified micro-emulsion method was found to reduce ignition delay and improve combustion efficiency. These approaches are applicable in preparing diverse metal-based energetic materials to improve their ignition and combustion properties.",2019
Weight-Based Evaluation of the Explosive Power of New Energetic Materials,"Accurately evaluating the explosive performance of newly developed energetic materials is important for the design of high-energy warheads. Different energetic materials have distinct effects in terms of thermal damage and damage caused by the pressure of the shock wave. In this study, the authors seek to quantitatively evaluate the explosive power of new energetic materials on the basis of the above factors. We consider single-parameter models for the evaluation of both the pressure of the shock wave and the thermal dose and use them to propose a comprehensive method to assess the explosive effects of new energetic materials based on their weight distribution. We first build a test system to obtain the thermal dose corresponding to the typical proportional distance based on the typical peak pressure. We then construct a normalized model of the surface-reflected pressure and the thermal dose by using the proportional distance related to a typical shock wave. Finally, we calculate the specific equivalent of new energetic materials relative to trinitrotoluene (TNT) and use it to quantitatively evaluate its explosive power. The results of experiments to assess the performance of the proposed method show that it is applicable and can be used to assess the explosive effects of new energetic materials.",2023
An investigation of the hot spot formation mechanism for energetic material,"The shock-induced pore collapsing and hot spot formation processes of plastic bonded explosives are simulated by molecular dynamics. After shock loading, the temperature field, pressure field, particle velocity field, energy field, plastic work field, and plastic temperature field are calculated by using the virtual grid method. A set of microscopic parameters about the hot spot are evaluated, including the pore collapsing time, pore collapsing speed, plastic work, and hot spot radius. The physical models to describe the energy dissipation and temperature relaxation behaviors of the hot spot are developed. We find that the hot spot formation consists of three steps: pore collapsing, work-heat transition, and temperature relaxation. The pore collapsing speed is proportional to the piston speed, and the temperature relaxation time is proportional to the square of the hot spot radius. Published by AIP Publishing.",2017
Solvent-reagent effect in chemical detection of energetic materials type contaminants,"Present study extended the list of solvent and reagents appropriate to use for the colorimetric detection and semi quantitative analysis of various energetic compounds. The new reagents used in this study include DMSO as solvent/reagent, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide for the generation of a basic medium. The advantages of these reagents vs. older procedures are discussed in this paper. Also, a standardized procedure for the analysis of several classes of energetic compounds has been developed, allowing an excellent practical application of the recommended method. The influence of different solvents on the changes in the UV/VIS spectra were evaluated and an attempt to interpret the resulting absorption UV spectra based on quantum-chemical calculations has been done.",2009
Maize Straw as a Valuable Energetic Material for Biogas Plant Feeding,"Maize has great potential, especially as a substrate for biofuels production. The aim of this paper is to analyze the possibility of usage in methane fermentation maize straw harvested in different weather conditions, which had an influence on different physical parameters, mainly the dry mass content. The research has shown that maize straw harvested in Central-Eastern Europe can have a broad spectrum of dry mass content, which is related to diverse weather conditions during autumn. However, independently from moisture content, maize straw can be a good (for more wet material) or very good (for more dried straw) substrate for the biogas plant. With the methane productivity reaching 201-207 m(3)/Mg of fresh mass, this material is a significantly better substrate than that typically used in Europe maize silage (approximately 105 m(3)/Mg FM). It was noted that the retention time for maize straw (36-42 days) is longer than in the case of maize silage (less than 30 days). However, this difference is quite small and can be accepted by the biogas plant operators.",2019
Zwitterionic fused pyrazolo-triazole based high performing energetic materials,"A series of nitrogen-rich fused energetic materials were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive starting materials and fully characterized using H-1 and C-13 NMR, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and DSC. The structure of zwitterionic compound 2 was supported by SCXRD data. Among all, 3 and 4 possess excellent detonation velocity (8956 and 9163 m s(-1)) and are insensitive towards friction (>360 N) and impact (10 J), having moderate to excellent thermal stability (171-262 degrees C). It is worth mentioning that the zwitterionic fused pyrazolo-triazole compound 2 and its energetic salts offer remarkable performance as new-generation thermally stable energetic materials.",2024
Nanodiamond-based energetic core-shell composites: The route towards safer materials,"This work proposes to determine how diamond has an influence on the structure (core-shell morphology or not) as well as on the desensitization of ND-RDX (Nanodiamond - cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) mixtures. RDX is one of the most used high performance explosives worldwide for military and civil applications. ND-RDX composite core-shell particles are obtained by Spray Flash Evaporation (SFE), a patented process developed in the laboratory. The characteristics and pyrotechnical properties of the resulting core-shell compounds are then compared to those of composite materials prepared by other means like slow evaporation and physical mixing. Further investigation of the sample morphology and the core-shell architecture are also discussed in the light of XPS and BET measurements. Finally, the interest of the nanodiamond properties to elaborate an energetic material that combines high energetic performance with desensitization to impact and friction in order to ensure safer handling is outlined hereinafter.",2019
Additive Manufacturing of Energetic Materials and Its Uses in Various Applications,"The work discussed in this document seeks to utilize traditional additive manufacturing techniques to selectively deposit energetic materials. The goal was to gain a fundamental understanding of how to use commonplace 2D inkjet printing and 3D fused deposition technology to selectively deposit reactive materials. Doing so provides the ability to manipulate the geometry, as well as composition, of the energetic material during the manufacturing process. Achieving this level manipulation and control has shown to be nontrivial, if not impossible, using traditional manufacturing methods. The ability to change the geometry of the energetic material at will greatly increases the ability of these energetic materials to be integrated with a wide range of systems, such as transient electronics. To create a transient electronic device, a destruction mechanism and an initiation system need to be integrated with electronic components. Experiments in this document investigate nanothermites for their ability to serve as this destruction mechanism. Nanothermites were prepared at various equivalence ratios and syringe deposited onto silicon substrates. The resultant destruction was shown to vary with the equivalence ratio of the material. A wide range of substrate destruction was demonstrated, varying from disintegration to only charring the wafer. Materials prepared near stoichiometric conditions were shown to disintegrate the silicon substrates completely. As the equivalence ratio was raised, less severe destruction was observed. The ability inkjet print these nanothermites provides the geometric control necessary to incorporate them into electronic components. An ink formulation process was explored in an attempt to create a fuel and an oxidizer ink, which could be inkjet printed simultaneously to create a nanothermite. Separate inks allow for the equivalence ratio, and therefore the resultant destruction, to be selectively tuned during the additive manufacturing process. Additionally, this gives the advantage of only needing two largely inert, shelf stable inks, instead of having to develop a new ink for every desired destruction level. Various candidate inks were formulated using different loadings and combinations of surfactants. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was shown to be the surfactant best suited for holding both aluminum and copper (II) oxide nanoparticles in suspension over time. These inks both showed reasonable shelf stability as well as viable reactivity when stoichiometric nanothermite samples were prepared using on-chip mixing. With respect to 3D printed energetic materials, fused deposition methods were used to print a fluoropolymer based energetic material which could be used as a multifunctional reactive structure. A reactive filament comprising of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with 20\% mass loading of aluminum (Al) was prepared using a commercial filament extruder and printed using a Makerbot Replicator 2X. The printing performance of the energetic samples was compared with standard 3D printing materials using metrics such as bead-to-bead adhesion and the surface quality of the printed samples. The reactivity and burning rates of the filaments and the printed samples were shown to be comparable. This result is imperative for fused deposition modeling to be used as a viable manufacturing method of energetic materials. In total, this document lays some of the groundwork necessary for additive manufacturing to be adopted as a viable method for the selective deposition of energetic materials. Going forward these methods can be used to integrate energetic materials in a manner not possible using traditional manufacturing methods.",2017
Geometric and Energetic Properties of Defects at Complementary Soft Material Interfaces,"Surface architecture can influence mechanical properties, such as adhesion and friction, in many natural systems. The careful study of these systems elucidates understanding of the many biological roles these properties serve and the mechanisms by which they occur. One means of controlling surface mechanical properties is through shape complementarity. Predicated on some natural systems’ surface architectural design, shape complementarity can be used to enhance selectively between synthetic elastomeric surfaces. Complementary arrays of surface structures, such as 1D ridges or fibrils arranged in a 2D lattice, can inter-digitate to achieve adhesion enhancement controlled by shape recognition. It has been shown that relative misorientation (twist) is accommodated by defects that are mesoscale screw dislocations. The arrangement of such dislocations plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties of the interface. The objective of our work is to increase the understanding of adhesive and frictional enhancement mechanisms through the study of complementary surface pattern interactions of precisely designed soft elastomeric materials. Here we study the geometric properties of one-dimensional (ridge/channel) and two-dimensional (arrays of pillars) shape-complementary interfaces in the presence of relative misorientation and difference in lattice spacing. Relative misorientation without difference in lattice period spacing is accommodated by arrays of screw dislocations. Differences in lattice spacing without misorientation is accommodated by arrays of edge dislocations. In general, we observe arrays of dislocations with mixed screw and edge character. The spacing, orientation, and potential mechanical properties of these arrays can be predicted using the geometry of Moiré patterns. More broadly, we show that soft materials with shape-complementary patterns can be used to generate dislocations of arbitrary edge and screw character at the mesolength scale of tens of microns. Because these dislocations are easily observed and occur periodically, Moiré pattern information is used to study relationships between dislocations, parameter selection, and surface mechanical properties. We extend the studies further by examining and taking advantage of the translational symmetry of fibrillar lattice structures for our experiments. We use typical 2D Bravais lattice structures patterned by microfibrils on the surfaces of a soft material and attempt to understand the roles of periodicity, fibril size, and density on surface mechanical properties. We develop a means of interpreting these results systematically based on pattern misorientation that is applicable to soft materials, thereby bridging crystallography with 2D soft material interactions. The increased understanding and interdisciplinary impact of these surface interfacial interactions can be used in many fields of study including soft material substrate tissue and graft engineering, mechanical engineering and mechanics scale up studies, and various industrial applications.",2016
Synthesis and Optical Ignition of Aluminum and Silicon-based Energetic Materials,"Energetic materials, aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si), due to their large volumetric energy densities, earth abundance, and low cost, have broad applications in propulsion, thermal batteries, waste disposal and power generation for microsystems. The energetic materials are commonly prepared by mixing fuel and oxidizer powders, however, the energy release rates are slow and difficult to ignite. Furthermore, the large portion of the reactants remains unburned due to the formation of the oxide layer during the reaction. Optimized energetic materials would have the reactive components mixed on a scale as fine as possible to reduce the mass transport distance and facilitate the ignition. This leads to the idea of reducing the sizes of energetic materials down to nanoscale to increase the surface area and contact area between the fuel and oxidizer. In this study, we investigated two new areas: 1) the effects of the nanostructured morphology on the exothermic reaction of Al and CuO, 2) demonstrate and understand the flash ignition of Al nanoparticles (NPs), and extending the flash ignition to Al microparticles (MPs) and porous Si. First, it remains a challenge to create energetic materials, a mixture of Al and metal oxides, with nanoscale uniformity. Here, we report synthesis and ignition studies on thermites (mixtures of Al and metal oxides) with unique nanostructures, i.e., CuO/Al core/shell nanowires (NWs) and Al/CuO core/shell micro and nano particles. The CuO NW cores were synthesized by the thermal annealing of copper films and served as templates for the deposition of Al shells by subsequent sputtering. Similarly, for core/shell particles, the Al particles were coated with a very thin CuO shell using a solution phase method. The advantage of such core/shell structures are that CuO and Al are uniformly mixed at the nanoscale with no aggregation. The onset temperatures of the exothermic reaction of the core/shell NWs were similar to those of nanoparticle NP-based thermites in terms of magnitude, and insensitivity to equivalence ratios. Moreover, the core/shell NW thermites, compared to NP-based thermites, exhibit greatly improved mixing uniformity and reduced activation energy for the thermite reaction. For Al/CuO core/shell particles, in comparison to mixtures of Al particles and CuO NPs, have better chemical homogeneity and physical contact between Al and CuO, so that the core/shell particles exhibit much larger burning rates. The core/shell structure is a general and effective structure to tailor the combustion performance of energetic materials. Second, nonintrusive optical flash ignition is attractive for many applications due to its simplicity, and flexibility in controlling the area exposed to the flash. However, the oxidation mechanism of Al NPs at large heating rates remains inconclusive due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. We studied the oxidation mechanism of Al NPs under large heating rate (on the order of 106 K/s or higher) by a simple flash ignition method, which uses a xenon flash to ignite Al NPs. The flash ignition occurs when the Al NPs have suitable diameters and sufficient packing density to increase the temperature above their ignition temperatures. We then extended the flash ignition to Al MPs. Flash ignition of Al MPs is challenging due to their higher minimum flash ignition energy, which originates from weaker light absorption and higher ignition temperature compared to Al NPs. By the addition of WO3 NPs to Al MPs, the minimum flash ignition energy of Al MPs was reduced and we studied the roles of WO3 NPs upon flash ignition. Finally, we demonstrate that freestanding porous Si films can also be optically ignited in ambient air by a xenon flash. Our complementary experimental and numerical studies reveal that the minimum flash ignition energy increases with increasing the thickness due to heat loss through the porous Si layer. The minimum flash ignition energy is lower for higher porosity Si",2013
Infrared measurements of energy transfer from energetic materials to steel substrates,Energy transfer from reacting thermites placed on a v-notch steel target was evaluated for two thermite compositions which were Boron with Iron (III) Oxide (B-Fe2O3) and Aluminum with Iron (III) Oxide (Al-Fe2O3). A high-speed infrared camera captured a temporally evolving temperature distribution on the substrate as the thermite reaction self propagated. Results quantified the percent of the overall energy available from the chemical reaction that was transferred into the substrate and lost via other heat transfer modes. Results showed the B-Fe2O3 reaction transferred 53% of its heat of reaction into the steel substrate compared to 11% for Al-Fe2O3. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved,2010
New correlations for predicting thermodynamic and physical properties of energetic materials,"Some new correlations have been recently developed to predict thermodynamic and physical properties of energetic compounds. These properties include solid and gas phase heat of formation, heat of detonation, detonation temperature, crystalline density and melting point. Different approaches have been used to predict mentioned properties by simple methods. Prediction of performance and thermochemical properties of energetic materials before their laboratory synthesis are problems of utmost importance to chemists because these methods can help them to eliminate any poor candidate. In this work, it will be shown that how new models can be used to describe thermodynamic and physical properties of energetic compounds.",2007
Nitrogen-rich polycyclic pentazolate salts as promising energetic materials: theoretical investigating,"Pentazolate (cyclo-N-5(-)) salts are nitrogen-rich compounds with great development potential as energetic materials due to their full nitrogen anion. However, the densities of available N-5(-) salts are generally low, which seriously lowers their performances. It is necessary to screen out cyclo-N-5(-) salts with high density. To this end, eight new non-metallic cyclo-N(5)(- )salts based on fused heterocycle were designed. -NH2, -NO2, and -O- groups were introduced into the compounds to adjust and improve the detonation performance and impact sensitivity of cyclo-N-5(-) salts. By theoretical calculations and Hirshfeld surface analyses, the densities, heats of formation, detonation performance, sensitivities, and crystal structures of the title compounds were predicted, and the contribution of hydrogen bond as well as pi-pi stacking to the stability of cyclo-N-5(-) salt was revealed. The results indicate that the densities of title compounds are higher than 1.85 g cm(-3), and the sensitivities of these compounds are predicted to be lower than that of HMX. The detonation properties of a (D = 9.47 km s(-1), P = 41 .21 GPa) and d (D = 9.44 km s(-1), P = 40.26 GPa) are better than those of HMX. These mean that using fused ring as a cation and introducing proper substituents are an effective method to improve cyclo-N-5(-) salt's density and balance the detonation performance and sensitivity.",2022
Preparation and Characterization of Al/HTPB Composite for High Energetic Materials,"Nanosized Al (nAl) powders offer increased reactivity than the conventional micron-sized counterpart, thanks to their reduced size and increased specific surface area. While desirable from the combustion viewpoint, this high reactivity comes at the cost of difficult handling and implementation of the nanosized powders in preparations. The coating with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is proposed to improve powder handling and ease of use of nAl and to limit its sensitivity to aging. The nAl/HTPB composite can be an intermediate product for the subsequent manufacturing of mixed high-energy materials while maintaining the qualities and advantages of nAl. In this work, experimental studies of the high-energy mixture nAl/HTPB are carried out. The investigated materials include two composites: nAl (90 wt.%) + HTPB (10 wt.%) and nAl (80 wt.%) + HTPB (20 wt.%). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is performed from 30 to 1000 degrees C at slow heating rate (10 degrees C/min) in inert (Ar) and oxidizing (air) environment. The combustion characteristics of propellant formulations loaded with conventional and HTPB-coated nAl are analyzed and discussed. Results show the increased burning rate performance of nAl/HTPB-loaded propellants over the counterpart loaded with micron-sized Al.",2020
Microwave Enhancement of Energetic Materials Combustion Through Gas-Phase Flame Interactions,"Traditionally, energetic materials’ energy output has been limited to being controlled via formulations and, once an energetic material is manufactured, dynamic change of energy output during combustion is difficult. These limitations are specific to all types of energetic materials, including propellants and pyrotechnics. Thus, a new robust method is needed to control energetic materials' energy release. This work explores microwave interactions with energetic material multiphase flames through interaction with the gas-phase of an energetic material to address these limitations. This dissertation discusses three studies on microwave enhancement of combustion of both composite solid propellants and Mg-based pyrotechnics. First, solid propellant flames were studied in microwave fields at atmospheric pressure. Through doping of the composite solid propellant with alkali metal (i.e., sodium nitrate, NaNO 3 ), flame ionization and free-electron population were able to be enhanced, allowing more efficient collisional microwave energy transfer to the flame and higher steady-state propellant burning rate enhancement of up to 60%. The second study examined the use of microwave energy to modulate the light emission intensity and/or light emission color of a pyrotechnic flame. Microwave field interaction with pyrotechnics comprised of magnesium (Mg) fuel and an oxidizer (alkali-nitrate of sodium, potassium, or cesium) is studied. Light emission enhancement of up to 120 % in the visible range is demonstrated, which has little effect on flame emission chromaticity. The third investigation area explored the color-shifting abilities of an Mg/PTFE pyrotechnic with low free-electron populations. Color shifting was demonstrated in the diffusion flame of the pyrotechnics, where this emission enhancement primarily occurs from excitation of molecular electronic transitions and continuum emission. Gray body continuum temperature fits showed an increase in flame temperatures of ~100-300 K. These studies illustrate the many different mechanisms through which microwave energy can interact with the multiphase flame environment of energetic material and several different useful combustion responses produced from microwave illumination.",2020
-Trinitroethyl-substituted azoxyfurazan: high detonation performance energetic materials,"Azoxyfurazan derivatives based on the trinitroethyl functionality were synthesized. These energetic N-trinitroethyl-substituted azoxyfurazans were fully characterized by using H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, IR, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction, and, in the case of N-trinitroethylamino azoxyfurazan 4, with N-15 NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, compound 4 and nitramine 5 have been tested for their responses to impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge. The detonation pressures and velocities of the azoxyfurazan derivatives were calculated, ranging from 35.8 GPa to 41.2 GPa and 8861 m s(-1) to 9458 m s(-1), respectively. Additionally, compound 5 having an oxygen balance of near zero (+2.5%), exhibits a favorable measured density (1.92 g cm(-3)) and excellent detonation property (Delta H-f(m), 962.1 kJ mol(-1); P, 41.2 GPa; D, 9458 m s(-1)). Thus, these compounds could be potential high detonation performance energetic materials.",2015
Deep learning for synthetic microstructure generation in a materials-by-design framework for heterogeneous energetic materials,"The sensitivity of heterogeneous energetic (HE) materials (propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics) is critically dependent on their microstructure. Initiation of chemical reactions occurs at hot spots due to energy localization at sites of porosities and other defects. Emerging multi-scale predictive models of HE response to loads account for the physics at the meso-scale, i.e. at the scale of statistically representative clusters of particles and other features in the microstructure. Meso-scale physics is infused in machine-learned closure models informed by resolved meso-scale simulations. Since microstructures are stochastic, ensembles of meso-scale simulations are required to quantify hot spot ignition and growth and to develop models for microstructure-dependent energy deposition rates. We propose utilizing generative adversarial networks (GAN) to spawn ensembles of synthetic heterogeneous energetic material microstructures. The method generates qualitatively and quantitatively realistic microstructures by learning from images of HE microstructures. We show that the proposed GAN method also permits the generation of new morphologies, where the porosity distribution can be controlled and spatially manipulated. Such control paves the way for the design of novel microstructures to engineer HE materials for targeted performance in a materials-by-design framework.",2020
"The skeleton of 5,7-fused bicyclic imidazole-diazepine for heat-resistant energetic materials","In light of the low yields and complex reaction routes of some well-known 5,5-fused and 5,6-fused bicyclic compounds, a series of 5,7-fused bicyclic imidazole-diazepine compounds were developed with high yields by only two efficient steps. Significantly, the seven-membered heterocyclic ring has a stable energetic skeleton with multiple modifiable sites. However, the 5,7-fused bicyclic energetic compounds were rarely reported in the area of energetic materials. Three neutral compounds 1, 2 and 4 were synthesized in this work. To improve the detonation performances of the 5,7-fused neutral compounds, corresponding perchlorate 1a and 2a were further developed. The physicochemical and energetic performances of all newly developed compounds were experimentally determined. All newly prepared energetic compounds exhibit high decomposition temperatures (T-d: 243.8-336 degrees C) and low mechanical sensitivities (IS: >15 J, FS: >280 N). Among them, the velocities performances of 1a (D-v = 7651 m/s) and 4 (D-v = 7600 m/s) are comparable to that of typical heat-resistant energetic material HNS (D-v = 7612 m/s). Meanwhile, the high decomposition temperature and low mechanical sensitivities (T-d = 336 degrees C; IS = 32 J; FS > 353 N) of 4 are superior to that of HNS (T-d = 318 degrees C; IS = 5 J; FS = 250 N). Hence, the 5,7-fused bicyclic compounds with high thermostability, low sensitivities and adjustable detonation performance have a clear tendency to open up a new space for the development of heat-resistant energetic materials.(c) 2022 China Ordnance Society.

Prediction of low-velocity-impact ignition threshold of energetic materials by shear-band mesoscale simulations,"When energetic materials are subjected to a low-velocity impact, they can develop viscoplastic localization, also known as an adiabatic shear band (ASB), leading to unwanted ignition. In this work, the simulation of shear band formation at mesoscale resolution has been incorporated in an ignition model. The simulation results suggest that a low-velocity impact induces the formation of an ASB, leading to ignition. Good agreement was found between the ignition model predictions and available impact test data. The ability of the model to predict the ignition threshold solely on the basis of mesoscale simulations demonstrates its superiority over existing empirical models.",2018
Experimental and theoretical studies of the decomposition of new imidazole based energetic materials: Model systems,"Decomposition of three imidazole based model energetic systems (2-nitroimidazole, 4-nitroimidazole, and 1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The initial decomposition mechanism for these three nitroimidazoles is explored with nanosecond energy resolved spectroscopy, and quantum chemical theory at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level. The NO molecule is observed as an initial decomposition product from these three nitroimidazoles subsequent to UV excitation. A unique, excitation wavelength independent dissociation channel is observed for these three nitroimidazoles that generates the NO product with a rotationally cold (similar to 50 K) and a vibrationally mildly hot (similar to 800 K) distribution. Potential energy surface calculations at the CASSCF/6-31G(d) level of theory illustrate that conical intersections play an important and essential role in the decomposition mechanism. Electronically excited S-2 nitroimidazole molecules relax to the S-1 state through the (S-2/S-1) CI conical intersection, and undergo a nitro-nitrite isomerization to generate the NO product from the S-1 potential energy surface. Nevertheless, NO2 elimination and nitro-nitrite isomerization are expected to be competitive reaction mechanisms for the decomposition of these molecules on the ground state potential energy surface from the Franck-Condon equilibrium geometry through thermal dissociation.

Polynitro-N-aryl-C-nitro-pyrazole/imidazole Derivatives: Thermally Stable-Insensitive Energetic Materials,A wide array of methoxy-substituted-polynitro-aryl-pyrazole/imidazoles with readily oxidizable -NH2/NO2/ NHNO2/diazo functional groups is synthesized. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the molecular structure of the compounds.

Energetic ions during plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition and their role in tailoring material properties,"Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) has obtained a prominent position in the synthesis of nanoscale films with precise growth control. Apart from the well-established contribution of highly reactive neutral radicals towards film growth in PEALD, the ions generated by the plasma can also play a significant role. In this work, we report on the measurements of ion energy and flux characteristics on grounded and biased substrates during plasma exposure to investigate their role in tailoring material properties. Insights from such measurements are essential toward understanding how a given PEALD process at different operating conditions can be influenced by energetic ions. Ion flux-energy distribution functions (IFEDFs) of reactive plasmas typically used for PEALD (O-2, H-2, N-2) were measured in a commercial 200 mm remote inductively coupled plasma ALD system equipped with RF substrate biasing. IFEDFs were obtained using a gridded retarding field energy analyzer and the effect of varying ICP power, pressure and bias conditions on the ion energy and flux characteristics of the three reactive plasmas were investigated. The properties of three material examples-TiOx, HfNx and SiNx-deposited using these plasmas were investigated on the basis of the energy and flux parameters derived from IFEDFs. Material properties were analyzed in terms of the total ion energy dose delivered to a growing film in every ALD cycle, which is a product of the mean ion energy, total ion flux and plasma exposure time. The properties responded differently to the ion energy dose depending on whether it was controlled with RF substrate biasing where ion energy was enhanced, or without any biasing where plasma exposure time was increased. This indicated that material properties were influenced by whether or not ion energies exceeded energy barriers related to physical atom displacement or activation of ion-induced chemical reactions during PEALD. Furthermore, once ion energies were enhanced beyond these threshold barriers with RF substrate biasing, material properties became a function of both the enhanced ion energy and the duration for which the ion energy was enhanced during plasma exposure. These results have led to a better insight into the relation between energetic ions and the ensuing material properties, e.g. by providing energy maps of material properties in terms of the ion energy dose during PEALD. It serves to demonstrate how the measurement and control of ion energy and flux characteristics during PEALD can provide a platform for synthesizing nanoscale films with the desired material properties.",2019
QSPR modeling of detonation parameters and sensitivity of some energetic materials: DFT vs. PM3 calculations,The quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodology was applied to describe and seek the relationship between the structures and energetic properties (and sensitivity) for some common energy compounds. An extended series of structural and energetic descriptors was obtained with density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP and semi-empirical PM3 approaches. Results indicate that QSPR model constructed using quantum descriptors can be applied to verify the confidence of calculation results compared with experimental data. It can be extended to predict the properties of similar compounds.,2017

Resilience to Conformational Fluctuations Controls Energetic Disorder in Conjugated Polymer Materials: Insights from Atomistic Simulations,"Increasing the crystallinity of thin films in concert with the planarization of the conjugated backbones has long been considered as the key for success in the design of polymer materials with optimized charge transport properties. Recently, this general belief had to be revisited with the emergence of a new class of disordered or even seemingly amorphous donor- acceptor conjugated polymers that exhibit charge mobilities larger than 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). By combining all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to electronic structure calculations on three representative polymers, we demonstrate that high crystallinity and planar conjugated backbones are not mandatory to reach low-energetic-disorder materials. It is rather the resilience to thermal fluctuations of the torsions along the conjugated backbones within and between structural domains and the bulkiness of the alkyl side chains that control the energy landscape.",2019
Reversible intramolecular hydrogen transfer: a completely new mechanism for low impact sensitivity of energetic materials,"The intramolecular H transfer of energetic NO2-compounds has been recognized as a possible primary step in triggering molecular decomposition for a long time. Nevertheless, studies on H transfer in different complex situations are limited, lacking a comprehensive understanding of its role in NO2-compounds. In this work, twenty intramolecular H transfer reactions are studied for eighteen nitro compounds and compared with the NO2 partition in thermodynamics and kinetics. Three factors, including the high planarity of molecules, the short transfer distance between the target H and O atoms and the high protonation of the H atom are identified to facilitate H transfer. If H transfer is more kinetically favorable than NO2 partition, and if a reverse H transfer occurs with a barrier less than 30 kcal mol(-1), we define it as a reversible one. In our study, for those impact insensitive nitro compounds with H-50 larger than that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, all of them are found to be accompanied with reversible H transfer, while the impact sensitive compounds are not. Accordingly, we propose that the reversible H transfer can effectively buffer the external stimuli against the molecular decomposition through chemical energy absorption/release. Beyond the conventional understanding that H transfer triggers molecular decomposition, this work builds a new correlation between reversible H transfer and the low impact sensitivity of energetic nitro-compounds.",2019
Dynamic calibration and analysis of crack tip propagation in energetic materials using real-time radiography,"Crack propagation in a solid rocket motor environment is difficult to measure directly. This experimental and analytical study evaluated the viability of real-time radiography for detecting bore regression and propellant crack propagation speed. The scope included the quantitative interpretation of crack tip velocity from simulated radiographic images of a burning, center-perforated grain and actual real-time radiographs taken on a rapid-prototyped model that dynamically produced the surface movements modeled in the simulation. The simplified motor simulation portrayed a bore crack that propagated radially at a speed that was 10 times the burning rate of the bore. Comparing the experimental image interpretation with the calibrated surface inputs, measurement accuracies were quantified. The average measurements of the bore radius were within 3% of the calibrated values with a maximum error of 7%. The crack tip speed could be characterized with image processing algorithms, but not with the dynamic calibration data. The laboratory data revealed that noise in the transmitted X-Ray intensity makes sensing the crack tip propagation using changes in the centerline transmitted intensity level impractical using the algorithms employed.",2015

Polynitro-Functionalized Azopyrazole with High Performance and Low Sensitivity as Novel Energetic Materials,"The development of energetic materials is still facing a huge challenge because the relationship between energy and sensitivity is usually contradictory: high energy is always accompanied with low sensitivity. Here, a high-energy, low-sensitivity energetic polynitro-functionalized azopyrazole (TNAP) and its energetic salts have been synthesized. The structural characterization of these compounds was analyzed by elemental analysis, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies, and infrared spectroscopy. The single-crystal structure of compounds K(2)TNAP, TNAP, 5, and 6 was obtained by X-ray diffraction, and K(2)TNAP is a novel energetic metal-organic framework. The calculated detonation properties of TNAP (9040 m s(-1) and 36.0 GPa) are superior to that of RDX (8796 m s(-1) and 33.6 GPa). In addition, TNAP also has lower mechanical sensitivity (IS > 40 J, FS = 244 N) and higher decomposition temperature (T-d = 221 degrees C) than RDX (IS = 7.4 J, FS = 120 N, and Td = 204 degrees C). These experimental results suggest that TNAP may become a new candidate for secondary explosives.",2022
Machine Learning-Assisted High-Throughput Virtual Screening for On-Demand Customization of Advanced Energetic Materials,"Finding energetic materials with tailored properties is always a significant challenge due to low research efficiency in trial and error. Herein, a methodology combining domain knowledge, a machine learning algorithm, and experiments is presented for accelerating the discovery of novel energetic materials.

Energetic Materials Based on W/PTFE/Al: Thermal and Shock-Wave Initiation of Exothermic Reactions,"The parameters of combustion synthesis and shock-wave initiation of reactive W/PTFE/Al compacts are investigated. Preliminary thermodynamic calculations showed the possibility of combustion of the W/PTFE/Al system at high adiabatic temperatures (up to 2776 degrees C) and a large proportion of condensed combustion products. The effect of the Al content (5, 10, 20, and 30 wt%) in the W/PTFE/Al system on the ignition and development of exothermic reactions was determined. Ignition temperatures and combustion rates were measured in argon, air, and rarefied air. A correlation between the gas medium, rate, and temperature of combustion was found. The shock initiation in W/PTFE/Al compacts with different Al content was examined. The extent of reaction in all compacts was studied by X-ray diffraction. The compositions with 10 and 20 wt% Al showed the highest completeness of synthesis after combustion and shock-wave initiation.",2021
Carbon addition lowers initiation and iodine release temperatures from iodine oxide-based biocidal energetic materials,"Iodine oxides are of significant interest as strong oxidizers in energetic formulation that also operate as iodine release agents for neutralization of spores using strong thermal pulses. In this paper incorporation of carbon black (CB) as the main fuel or additive into iodine oxides-based energetic materials are shown to lower both initiation and iodine release temperatures compared to those of Al/iodine oxides and Ta/iodine oxides thermites. Those lowering effects were triggered by a condensed phase CB-iodine oxides reaction explored by high heating rate time-resolved temperature-jump time-of-flight mass spectrometry and low heating rate thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry results. We observe that other carbon allotropes, such as carbon nanotubes and functionalized graphene sheets, also feature the similar effect as CB. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis shows that the presence of CB lowered the bond energy of iodine oxide on the surface to trigger the CB-iodine oxide initiation at a relatively lower temperature.

A Market-Basket Approach to Predict the Acute Aquatic Toxicity of Munitions and Energetic Materials,"An ongoing challenge in chemical production, including the production of insensitive munitions and energetics, is the ability to make predictions about potential environmental hazards early in the process. To address this challenge, a quantitative structure activity relationship model was developed to predict acute fathead minnow toxicity of insensitive munitions and energetic materials. Computational predictive toxicology models like this one may be used to identify and prioritize environmentally safer materials early in their development. The developed model is based on the Apriori market-basket/frequent itemset mining approach to identify probabilistic prediction rules using chemical atom-pairs and the lethality data for 57 compounds from a fathead minnow acute toxicity assay. Lethality data were discretized into four categories based on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Apriori identified toxicophores for categories two and three. The model classified 32 of the 57 compounds correctly, with a fivefold cross-validation classification rate of 74 %. A structure-based surrogate approach classified the remaining 25 chemicals correctly at 48 %. This result is unsurprising as these 25 chemicals were fairly unique within the larger set.",2016
"Compatibility Study of 2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyridine-1-oxide with Some Energetic Materials","For the application of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyridine-1-oxide (ANPyO) in composite explosives, the compatibility of ANPyO with some energetic materials was studied by the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), where the energetic materials were cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX), 3,4-dinitrofurazanfuroxan (DNTF), hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TATB), 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO), 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), 5-amino-1H-tetrazole nitrate (5-ATEZN), ammonium perchlorate (AP), potassium perchlorate (KP), aluminum powder (Al), boron powder (B), magnesium hydride (MgH2) and magnesium borohydride (Mg(BH4)(2)). The results showed that the binary systems of ANPyO/CL-20, ANPyO/NTO, ANPyO/5-ATEZN, ANPyO/Al, ANPyO/B, ANPyO/MgH2 and ANPyO/Mg(BH4)(2) are compatible, and that the systems of ANPyO with RDX, LLM-105, HMX, AP and KP are sensitive, and with DNTF, TNT and TATB are incompatible.",2016
The Right Tool for the Job: Microcalorimetry in Energetic Materials Research and Runaway Reaction Evaluation,"Accurate knowledge of modem calorimetric techniques and proper calorimetric testing strategies are essential for the successful operation of energetic materials and process safety testing laboratories. Although many tools and techniques have been introduced in open literature, there is still a lack of practical and sound strategy of safety testing protocols for both academic and industrial labs. This presentation will review the modern calorimetric techniques and scenario-based testing protocol for energetic materials/reactive chemicals hazard assessment. Emphasis will be given on the issues of calorimeter applicability and data scalability. The examples of use and misuse of calorimetric tools and data will be demonstrated. Since instrument developments in calorimetry science are usually not reported in primary literature and calorimetric experiments are not always performed with appropriate instruments, a guide for choosing the best calorimeter for a given task will be described. Case studies illustrate the practical values of various modem calorimetric devices on the market for energetic materials research, chemical process safety, and reaction kinetic studies.",2011
Polyiodo Azole-Based Metal-Organic Framework Energetic Biocidal Material for Synergetic Sterilization Applications,"Biological hazards caused by bacteria, viruses, and toxins have become a major survival and development issue facing the international community. However, the traditional method of disinfection and sterilization is helpless in dealing with viruses that spread quickly and are highly infectious. Metal-organic framework (MOF) biocidal materials hold promise as superior alternatives to traditional sterilization materials because of their stable framework structures and unique properties. Now, we demonstrate for the first time the synthesis of a MOF (TIBT-Cu) containing Cu metal centers and tetraiodo-4,4'-bi-1,2,4-triazole as the main ligand.

New green energetic materials based on unsymmetrically substituted pyrazole-tetrazines and their hydroperchlorates,"Five novel nitrogen-rich energetic materials were synthesized using 3,6-bis(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazole-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (BT) and 3,6-bis(pyrazole-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine as raw materials. The materials were comprehensively characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, mass spectra and elemental analysis. The synthesized compounds show good experimental densities, ranging from 1.59 to 1.70 g cm(-3). DSC technology was used for analyzing the thermal stability. The decomposition temperatures of the five energetic materials ranged from 204.0 to 276.5 degrees C. Non-isothermal kinetic parameters and formation enthalpy values were computed. In addition, friction sensitivity measurements were performed according to BAM methods, and the results showed that the five compounds can be classified as insensitive energetic materials. For a better understanding of the electronic structural characteristics, the electrostatic potential (ESP) and natural bond orbitals (NBOs) of compounds 1 and 2 were further computed. The detonation parameters were obtained via EXPLO5 V6.04. The detonation velocities of the five energetic materials were found to be in the range of 6436 m s(-1) to 7759 m s(-1), and their detonation pressures are between 15.8 GPa and 24.6 GPa.

"3-Nitro, 1-Amino Guanidine and 5-Hydrazino-1","The synthesis of 3-amino-1-nitroguanidine (3-ANQ) and 5-hydrazino tetrazole (5-HT) derivatives as new energetic materials are described. Reaction of 3-ANQ with triethyl orthoformate leads to the formation of 3-nitramino triazole while no reaction was observed whit 5-HT. Addition of NaN3 to a mixture of 3-ANQ and triethyl orthoformate, afforded 1-nitroguanidyl tetrazole in excellent yield. On the other hand, these compounds showed different reactivity toward dicyandiamide. Cyclization of 5-HT with dicyandiamide in EtOH/Water reflux caused formation of 3,5-Diamino-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole in good yield, nitration of which afforded 3,5-Dinitramino-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole as a potentially new high energetic molecule. No reaction was observed between 3-ANQ and dicyandiamide. The reaction of 3-ANQ and 5-HT were exanimated with trichloro triazine (TCT). 5-HT gave mixture of products while no reaction between 3-ANQ and TCT was detected. Unusual hydrazone condensation was observed between 3-ANQ and acetone, when acetone/water mixture used as solvent at 0 degrees C.",2015
Photo-responsive behaviors and structural evolution of carbon-nanotube-supported energetic materials under a photoflash,"The photo-responsive behaviors of energetic materials (metal/oxidant) supported by CNTs were investigated under a common photoflash. The remarkable ignition (and/or combustion) was observed in the metal/oxidant/CNT composite with an appropriate ratio, while no obvious change was found in the absence of CNT under the identical flash conditions. The structural characterization indicated that the metallic Zr was oxidized into the corresponding metal oxide (ZrO2) after ignition due to high temperature and the exposure to air ambient. The CNTs showed increased structural defects, indicated by HRTEM and Raman spectra. The enhanced photo-response can be attributed to the absorption capability of CNTs to flash energy and high thermal conductivity, leading to a rapid increase in the internal temperature of composite materials up to ignition temperature within a very short time.

Comparative Quantum Chemistry Study on the Unimolecular Decomposition Channels of Pyrazole and Imidazole Energetic Materials,"The difference in the initial decomposition step of pyrazoles and imidazoles was explored using the M062X method for optimization and G4-MP2 and approximated CCSD(T) methods for energies. Laplacian bond order analysis was used to study the effect of the nitro group on the bond strength and predict the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the ring. Thermochemistry results show that the most possible decay channel of 1H-pyrazole and 3-nitropyrazole is the N-2 elimination, while the preferred initial step of 1H-imidazole is the CHN elimination. However, the nitro-nitrite isomerization dominates the decomposition of other nitro derivatives of 1H-pyrazole and 1H-imidazole. As for the formation of HO and HONO, the high energy barrier makes it difficult to take place. Based on the analysis of the lowest energy barrier and the BDE of NO2 loss, it can be concluded that imidazoles are more stable than pyrazoles. This work contributes to revealing the difference in the initial step of energetic isomers and the understanding of the decomposition mechanism of energetic azoles.",2021
Experimental and Theoretical Study on the Stability of CL-20-Based Host-Guest Energetic Materials,"CL-20-based host-guest complexes are promising energetic materials, which are prepared by embedding small molecules into the crystal lattice cavity of anhydrous CL-20. The structure, interaction, stability, and detonation performance of a series of host-guest complexes were investigated by the combination method of density functional theory and experiment. Both the crystal structure of alpha-CL-20/H2O and alpha-CL-20/N2O revealed by powder X-ray diffraction and the thermal stability order of alpha-CL-20/N2O, alpha-CL-20/CO2, alpha-CL-20/H2O, and alpha-CL-20/H2O2 measured using a differential scanning calorimeter show excellent accordance between experimental results and simulative predication. Thus, the reliability of the calculation method can be judged by the result of this comparison. The stability of different host-guest structures was compared under vacuum, and the influence of intermolecular interactions on the structural stability was discussed. In view of the various factors affecting the performance of high-energy explosives, such as detonation performance, thermal stability, and density, we conclude that alpha-CL-20/O-3 could be regarded as a potential target high-energetic compound. On the basis of the above results, this calculation method can provide a theoretical basis for the preparation of CL-20-based host-guest energetic compounds.",2020
"1,3,4-Oxadiazole based thermostable energetic materials: synthesis and structure-property relationship","The increasing demands from both military and civilian applications inspired us to explore novel energetic materials with improved safety and energetic performance. Here, a class of C-C bond bridged polyazole energetic materials (based on 1,3,4-oxadiazole bridged polynitropyrazoles) were synthesized and fully characterized. A prediction model (two-dimensional (2D)-fingerprint and relevant Hirshfeld surfaces) was proposed to study the correlations between structures and physicochemical properties. Additionally, their energetic properties including detonation velocity, detonation pressure, sensitivity and thermal stability were fully characterized. Of these, compounds 3a and 3b possess excellent thermal stabilities (3a: T-dec = 338 degrees C and 3b: T-dec = 368 degrees C), desirable sensitivities (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N) and higher energetic properties (3a: D-v = 8099 m s(-1), P = 27.14 GPa and 3b: D-v = 8054 m s(-1), P = 26.53 GPa) than hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (a typical heat resistant explosive: T-dec = 318 degrees C; D-v = 7612 m s(-1), P = 24.30 GPa; IS = 5 J, FS = 240 N). Compound 6b exhibits high decomposition temperatures (T-dec = 265 degrees C), low sensitivities (IS = 30 J; FS = 360 N) and comparable detonation properties (D-v = 8710 m s(-1), P = 32.75 GPa) to RDX. Considering their desirable energetic properties, they could be applied in different classes of energetic materials such as heat resistant explosives (3a, 3b) and secondary explosives (6b), respectively.",2020
High density assembly of energetic molecules under the constraint of defected 2D materials,"High energy density is always a key goal in the development of energy storage or energetic materials (EMs). Apart from exploring novel EMs with high chemical energy, it is also desirable for traditional EMs to be assembled at a higher density. It has been shown that a molecular level compression effect occurs due to the stacking of 2D triaminoguanidine-glyoxal polymer (TAGP) layers, resulting in a higher density packing of HMX molecules with changed conformation (qy-HMX). The qy-HMX crystal formed under compression in the solvent has a unit cell parameter very close to that of a reported system observed under a pressure of 0.2 GPa. This shows that the qy-HMX molecules are trapped in the TAGP layers, resulting in a higher density (e.g. 2.13 g cm(-3)), heat of formation and better stability. Certain types of constrained qy-HMX crystals are free from defects, where no polymorphic transition and melting point are observed upon heating. Experiments and relevant calculations show that the best resulted hybrid HMX crystal has a detonation velocity of 10.40 km s(-1) and pressure of 53.9 GPa, respectively. Its ground specific impulse reaches about 292 s, much better than that of CL-20, making it a promising propellant component for use in future space explorations.",2019
A DFT study of five-membered nitrogen-containing fused heterocycles for insensitive highly energetic materials,"A series of molecules with conjugated backbones combined with two five-membered nitrogen-containing rings is suggested for the design of new energetic compounds. With the participation of both -NH2 and -NO2, seven planar derivatives were characterized with aromaticity and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The geometrical and electronic structures, gas and condensed-phase heats of formation (HOFs) and strengths of the hydrogen bonds were studied using density functional theory methods. The crystal structures of these compounds were predicted using molecular packing calculations. The bond dissociation energies (BDEs) were investigated to understand their stabilities. Our calculated results indicate that these compounds are promising candidates for energetic materials. Among them, two compounds with a B4 backbone, B4-1 and B4-2, possess high densities, great HOFs and detonation properties. B4-2 has not only a high density of 2.263 g cm(-3), heat of formation of 106.91 kcal mol(-1), detonation velocity of 9.74 km s(-1) and pressure of 47.79 GPa, but also a high BDE of 62.72 kcal mol(-1) and layered crystal packing, and can be considered as a potential candidate for high energetic materials with great insensitivity.",2016
Experimental analysis of rheological behaviour of a multi-base energetic material during non-continuous mixing,"The present work is focused on the experimental analysis of one of the main processes involved in manufacturing of energetic materials, such as the stage of non-continuous mixing, in which the solid and fluid initial elements are subject to plastic flow until the occurrence of gelation of the initial mixture and the achievement of expected mechanical properties. Non-continuous mixing of multi-base propellants is a really complex forming process of crucial relevance in production of these highly viscous special materials, because it defines the behavior that propellant doughs will present during their later extrusion and it also affects the physical, geometrical and ballistic properties of final products. In this work, the effect of mixing time, mixing energy and chemical formulation on rheological moduli of a triple-base propellant is analyzed, and some technical guidelines are proposed for optimization of mixing stage in propellant production.

High-Density Energetic Materials with Low Mechanical Sensitivity and Twinning Derived from Nitroimidazole Fused Ring,"The innovative synthesis of 3,8-dibromo-2,9-dinitro-5,6-dihydrodiimidazo [1,2-a:2 ',1 '-c]pyrazine and 3,9-dibromo-2,10-dinitro-6,7-dihydro-5H-diimidazo [1,2-a:2 ',1 '-c][1,4]diazepine is described in this study. The tricyclic fused molecular structures are formed by the respective amalgamation of piperazine and homopiperazine with the imidazole ring containing nitro. Compound  1  and  2  possess excellent high-density physical properties (rho(1) = 2.49 g/cm(3), rho(2) = 2.35 g/cm(3)) due to the presence of a fused ring structure and Br atom. In addition to their high density, they have high decomposition temperatures (T-d > 290 degrees C) which means that they have excellent thermal stability and can be used as potential heat-resistant explosives. Low mechanical sensitivities (IS > 40 J, FS > 360 N) are observed. The twinning structure of 2 was resolved by X-ray diffraction. Non-covalent interaction analysis, Hirshfeld surfaces, 2D fingerprint plot, and Electrostatic potential analysis were used to understand the intramolecular interactions in relation to physicochemical properties. The unique structures of this type of compound provide new potential for the evolution of energetic materials.",2024
Synthetic manifestation of trinitro-pyrazolo-2,"This study showcases the design and development of a facile method for synthesizing trinitro-pyrazolo-triazole (TNPT) and its derivatives. The synthesized compounds are analysed using multinuclear NMR [H-1, C-13, and N-15] and HRMS analyses. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction studies confirm the structure of some TNPT derivatives. Notably, compounds  8 ,  9 ,  11 , and  12  exhibit good thermal stability with a decomposition threshold above 250 degrees C, and show a high level of insensitivity towards impact and friction [impact sensitivity (IS) is more than 25 J and friction sensitivity (FS) is above 180 N]. Compound  12 , in particular, displays excellent performance characteristics [density 1.76 g cc(-1) (at 298 K), a high detonation velocity (D-v = 8550 m s(-1)), and good thermal stability (T-d = 280 degrees C), with high insensitivity towards impact and friction (IS = 35 J; FS = 180 N)].

Multi-Material Aerosol Jet Printing of Al/Cuo Nanothermites for Versatile Fabrication of Energetic Antennas,"In the present study, a nanoscale Al/CuO thermite system is patterned using a multi-material aerosol jet printing technology. Morphological analysis of samples manufactured with different printing configurations reveal a strong effect of the printhead design on microstructure and degree of mixing between the constituent materials, providing insight on fundamental mechanisms of inline aerosol-phase mixing during printing. The high-resolution patterning capability of aerosol jet printing is leveraged to fabricate both blended nanoscale Al/CuO thermites and antennas containing the nanothermite, which exhibit rapid and low-energy ignition upon exposure to a 2.45 GHz free space electromagnetic field, characterized by an ignition delay of & AP;130 ms and ignition energy of & AP;216 J. Moreover, the versatility of this approach is demonstrated by manufacturing compositionally graded samples, establishing multi-material aerosol jet printing as a compelling and versatile platform for microscale energetic device fabrication with broader utility for graded materials. This work shows promise for use of the technique for in situ manufacturing of standalone and integrated energetics and electromagnetic devices.",2023
Characterization of the Thermal Response of Energetic Materials in Storage Exposed to Harsh Thermal Environments,"The exposure of munitions to harsh thermal environments impacts their reliability, effectiveness, and safety. Specifically, the risk of energetic degradation and resulting consumption of propellant stabilizer poses a significant safety concern. Monitoring this exposure solely through testing is cost prohibitive and time consuming while related computational studies have not been reported. The two main objectives of this research are: (1) to develop and validate computational models needed to characterize the thermal response of munitions in storage and exposed to harsh thermal environments, and (2) to contribute to the state-of-the-art research in transient multi-mode heat transfer in enclosures with distributed internal thermal storage and exposed to external thermal radiation and wind-driven forced convection. The development of numerical models specific to munitions and munitions lifecycle scenarios provides a capability to generate thermal exposure data based on storage history and tabulated weather data needed to enhance understanding of the thermal behavior of packaged munitions in storage in several configurations. This work presents a methodology for characterizing thermal exposure and thermal interactions of munitions in storage. First, a fundamental model is developed which includes combined heat transfer by radiation, natural convection, and conduction in an enclosure and the model is validated against benchmark solutions. The results from the fundamental model indicate that some simplification of the detail of the packaging materials and the storage area walls in the numerical models is possible at higher Rayleigh numbers where the contribution to heat transfer of the thermal conductivity of the walls is reduced. Analytical model results follow the high-level trends in the experimental data and support the need for higher fidelity numerical models. From these general models, more specific models are developed for case studies involving interactions between a single type of munition and a storage structure. Each model is validated using experimental data. Building on a single type of munitions model, subsequent models are developed to characterize interactions between several categories of munitions, different types of packaging materials, and a variety of storage configurations. Additional models feature several characteristics including heat transfer between the enclosure and the packaged energetic materials by radiation, conduction, and natural convection, thermal conduction within the packaging, distributed thermal energy storage in packages, and external thermal radiation and wind-driven forced convection. While each scenario provides important information characterizing the thermal exposure of munitions, the ability to identify the harshest thermal exposure and related conditions that are most detrimental to munitions is particularly useful. The results show that the harshest thermal exposure occurs when the munition is unpackaged just before firing. This configuration results in the highest temperature gradients across a given munition and the largest temperature fluctuations over time. In igloo and ISO container storage scenarios, there is a narrow range of temperature variation based on location and packaging configuration while the temperature variation just before firing is much more pronounced. In the case of an ISO container, the factors that determine the severity of temperature exposure are primarily how close the munition is to the ceiling and the degree of obstruction from the ceiling and heated wall of the enclosure. For all scenarios having a wooden interior package is desired for reducing the temperature rise of a munition package and having a forest green painted metal exterior results in the greatest temperature change. Propellant stabilizer consumption is characterized and the percentage of consumption is reported for several scenarios. Stabilizer levels are found to vary non-uniformly across the volume and are a function of both temperature and time. Prevailing assumptions regarding the relation of the surface temperature of a propellant increment to the bulk temperature are accurate for limited thermal scenarios. This work shows that the thermal exposure of munitions can be effectively estimated through numerical simulation based on the storage area type, packaging type, and storage configuration. A user defined function specific to propellant degradation is developed to directly link exposure to degradation. This sets the foundation for further research such as characterization of propellant stabilizer depletion which contributes to the estimation of remaining useful life of munitions. Additional work can also be done to incorporate prototype packaging and munitions types. As new munition and packaging technologies emerge these computational models, as developed in the present research, can provide an understanding of the thermal response throughout the munitions lifecycle and contribute to producing high quality products.",2022
The effect of crystal anisotropy and plastic response on the dynamic fracture of energetic materials,"The thermomechanical behavior of solids includes dissipative processes such as plastic deformation and fracture. The relative importance of these processes on the response of energetic materials has been a subject of study for many decades due to their significance on ignition and reaction. However, a constitutive model to simulate the anisotropy of the crack patterns and the effect of plastic deformation due to slip in energetic materials is not yet available. Finite strain thermomechanical constitutive equations that couple crystal plasticity, an equation of state, and an anisotropic phase field damage model are presented. The model is implemented in a multiphysics finite element solver and used to simulate recent experiments on beta-HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) by Zaug et al. The simulations reproduce qualitatively the crack pattern and the crystal orientation dependence of the observed damage. Specifically, more damage is observed when the crystal is impacted in the (010) direction, while more plastic deformation is observed when the load is applied in the (110) direction. The present model represents a step forward to understand the interplay between plasticity and fracture in shocked beta-HMX single crystals. It can be used to gain insights into temperature increase and hot-spot formation under shock. Published under license by AIP Publishing.",2019
Combustion characterization and modeling of novel energetic materials: Si/PTFE/Viton and Al/PTFE/Viton,"The energetic materials Si/Polytetrafluoroethylene/Viton (SiTV) and Al/Poly\-tetra\-fluoro\-ethylene/Viton (AlTV) have drawn interest recently due to the increased availability and decreased cost of nano materials. The reactivity of aluminum based energetic materials is greatly enhanced with the use of nanometric reactants. Silicon sees order of magnitude increases in burning rate when nano silicon is used in place of micron sized silicon. A broad characterization of the combustion of these composites has been undertaken. Theoretical equilibrium calculations have been performed, as well as characterization of combustion in the instrumented burn tube at various mixture ratios, and pressed pellet burns at different mixture ratios and applied pressures. A comparison of two morphologically different Al materials was also carried out using the instrumented burn tube. Spectroscopic measurements were made of deflagrating SiTV and AlTV pellets. High-speed images were also recorded, and the synchronization of these with the emission spectra provided details the macro scale combustion behavior. Time dependent emission intensity was caused by growing product layers on the surface of the pellets. Temperatures for each mixture ratio were measured by emission spectroscopy and used as input to three simple combustion models. The Ward, Son, and Brewster model (WSB), the Koch model, and the Williams model were applied to AlTV combustion. The modeling results provided further support of the non constant pressure exponent theory, i.e., that AlTV burns in a transition region between a coupled flame and a condensed phase controlled reaction, resulting in pressure exponents that increase with pressure. Micron sized doped silicon powders were manufactured by ball milling commercially obtained doped silicon wafers. Four powders using different dopants and dopant concentrations were manufactured. These powders were characterized to determine their average particle size, specific surface area, crystalline content, and electrical and thermal properties. The effect of the doping on combustion was investigated by way of pressed pellet burning rate measurements. The burning rate was found to correlate with dopant concentration, regardless of the dopant type. It is proposed that the doping effect can be explained by increased electron mobility or increased lattice defects, both of which are proportional to dopant concentration.",2011
Adaptive residual convolutional neural network for compressive strength prediction of energetic materials using SEM images,"The microstructure of materials has a great influence on the macroscopic mechanical properties of materials, and the relationship between them is of great significance to the design of materials. With the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, many researchers have used convolutional neural networks (CNN) to correlate microscopic images with material properties, and achieved good results. However, for different types of material performance prediction tasks and datasets of different sizes, researchers need to design a special CNN network structure, and the adjustment steps of network structure parameters are cumbersome and time consuming. In this paper, an adaptive residual convolutional neural network with variable depth and width is proposed. We take the prediction error of the test dataset of the specific material performance prediction task as the evaluation index, and adaptively adjusts the network structure based on simulated annealing algorithm to find the best network structure. Finally, it is verified on the dataset composed of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and compressive strength of polymer explosive materials. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of our model is 1.3% and the goodness of fit ( R 2 ) is 0.943. Further, we use Grad-CAM to explore the correlation between material microstructure and material properties.",2024
Design and properties of a new family of bridged bis(nitraminotetrazoles) as promising energetic materials,"Density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed to design a new family of bridged bis(nitraminotetrazoles) based on the combination of bistetrazoles and the energetic nitramino as well as various linkage groups (tetrazine 1, alkoxy 2, methylene 3, carbonyl 4, tetrazene 5, amine 6, hydrazine 7 and azo 8). The optimized geometry, electronic properties, IR spectra and thermodynamics were calculated for investigating the molecular stability and chemical reactivity. Their energetic parameters including density, heats of formation, detonation properties, and impact sensitivity were extensively evaluated and the effects of linkage groups were investigated as well. These newly designed bridged bis(nitraminotetrazoles) exhibit acceptable oxygen balance, moderate impact sensitivities, high density, excellent heats of formation and good detonation performance, which in some cases (D = 9.33 km s(-1), P = 38.95 GPa) are comparable to that of the high-energy explosive HMX, making them promising candidates for new environmentally friendly HEDMs.",2019
Hydrothermal conversion of biomass (,"In the present study, the biomass was converted into liquid and solid residues by using hydrothermal liquefaction method at 250, 300 and 350 degrees C with (FeCl3, NaOH) and without catalyst. The resultant products were examined using GC-MS, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, SEM, and elemental analysis methods. According to the performed analyses, the highest liquid product yield (total bio-oil) was found to be 38.08% at 300 degrees C by using FeCl3 as catalyst. In the experiments carried out at 350 degrees C, the highest HHV value was found to be 32.35 MJ kg(-1) by using NaOH catalyst. The energy values of products obtained at the end of experiments were compared to the values obtained from pyrolysis and supercritical liquefaction method, and it was determined that the liquid products having higher level of energy value were achieved by using hydrothermal liquefaction method.",2018
Prediction of thermal explosion parameters for energetic materials on the basis of thermal analysis data,"Results obtained in calculations of thermal ignition delay periods in a wide temperature range are in good agreement with published data for octogene samples in the form of a sphere 12.7 mm in diameter and cylindrical NEPE propellant samples with diameters of 20 to 80 mm. The kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of materials, used in the calculations, were obtained by the DSC method with the use of hermetically sealed crucibles and crucibles with perforated covers under a nitrogen pressure of 10 MPa at heating rates of 0.1 to 1.0 deg min(-1).",2017
"2,4-Dinitrophenyl and Pentaerythrityltrinitrate as Explosophoric Units in the Synthesis of New Energetic Materials","Three novel energetic compounds were prepared from the common precursor 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene by using nucleophilic aromatic substitution as a key step with pentaerythritol, pentaerythritoltrinitrate, or glycidol. The thermal stability of 3-(2,4-dinitrophenoxy)-2,2-bis[(nitrooxy)methyl]propyl nitrate was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and its X-ray structure was determined.

"SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF LARGE GRADUAL SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLE EVENTS. I. FE, O, AND SEED MATERIAL","We have surveyed similar to 0.1-100 MeV nucleon(-1) O and Fe fluence spectra during 46 isolated, large gradual SEP events observed at ACE during solar cycles 23 and 24. Most SEP spectra are well represented by the four-parameter Band function with a normalization constant, low-energy spectral slope, high-energy spectral slope, and break energy. The O and Fe spectral slopes are similar and most spectra steepen above the break energy, probably due to common acceleration and transport processes affecting different ion species. SEP spectra above the break energies depend on the origin of the seed population; larger contributions of suprathermal flare material result in higher Fe/O ratios and flatter spectra at higher energies. SEP events with steeper O spectra at low energies and higher break energies are associated with slower coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while those associated with fast (>2000 km s(-1)) CMEs and ground level enhancements have harder or flatter spectra at low and high energies, and O break energies between similar to 1 and 10 MeV nucleon(-1). The latter events are enriched in He-3 and higher-energy Fe, and have Fe spectra that rollover at significantly lower energies compared with O, probably because Fe ions with smaller Q/M ratios can escape from the distant shock more easily than O ions with larger Q/M ratios. We conclude that SEP spectral properties result from many complex and competing effects, namely Q/M-dependent scattering, shock properties, and the origin of the seed populations, all of which must be taken into account to develop a comprehensive picture of CME-driven shock acceleration of large gradual SEP events.",2016
Energetic and structural analysis of N,"Here we have exposed the electronic structure, chemical bonding of the light-weight N2H4BH3 inorganic material for hydrogen storage applications and analyzed its hydrogen removal energetics using state-of-the-art first-principles method. The mechanism for the H-host bond weakening in this kind of solid has also been explored. It is shown that the electronic density of states of N(2)H(4)BH(3)d solid near the Fermi level is mainly contributed by the B p-states, H (B) s-states, and the end N p-states. The calculated smallest hydrogen removal energy of N2H4BH3 solid is 4.16 eV. One Li-modified structure has been obtained through ab initio relaxations and its hydrogen removal energies are found dramatically decreased by as much as 50% compared with those of pristine N2H4BH3 solid. The B-H bond weakening is attributed to the elongation of the bond length; for the N H bonds, the weakening is found to be due to the destabilization of N-H bonds before hydrogen removal and the stabilization of residual N-H bond after hydrogen removal. The weakening of these bonds is of great significance for the improvement of hydrogen desorption kinetics of the material. We propose this study should help to deepen understanding of properties of N2H4BH3 inorganic solid and its related materials for hydrogen storage applications and guide experimentalists and engineers to develop better candidate materials for the advance of the field.

"Trailblazing 3D MOFs Featuring 1,2,4-Dinitrimino Triazole: Redefining Energetic Materials and Iodine Encapsulation","The quest for high-performance energetic materials for defense and aerospace has intensified, focusing on balancing energy output and safety. This study presents the synthesis of 3D energetic metal-organic frameworks (EMOFs) [Na3(DNT)(H2O)]n (Na-MOF), [K2(DNT)2(H2O)]n (K-MOF), and [Cs2(DNT)]n (Cs-MOF) using 1,2,4-dinitrimino triazole (DNT) through a hydrothermal process. The synthesized EMOFs are characterized using infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, and structures confirmed via single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing 3D frameworks with crystal densities of 2.15, 2.16, and 2.86 g cm-3, respectively. Among them, Na-MOF exhibits excellent detonation performance (VOD = 8900 m s-1, DP = 26.21 GPa), high thermal stability (Td = 369 degrees C), and insensitivity to impact and friction (IS = 40 J, FS = 360 N). K-MOF displays balanced energetic and mechanical properties, while Cs-MOF, though moderate in energetic performance, shows significant potential in pyrotechnic applications, producing a bright red flame. Intermolecular interactions are analyzed through Hirshfeld surface, 2D fingerprint, and SEM analyses, enhancing the understanding of particle size and morphology. Na-MOF also demonstrates high iodine encapsulation capacity, positioning it as a potential replacement for traditional materials like RDX and heat-resistant explosives such as HNS, with comparability to PYX.

Electrical and thermal investigations of energetic material (n-C,"The thermal energy storage material, namely hexadecyl ammonium tetrachloro cadmate (n-C16H33NH3)(2)CdCl4, which belongs to the organic-inorganic hybrid layered compounds, was synthesized as an example of long-chain complexes of the series (n-CnH2n+1NH3)(2)CdCl4 (n=8-18). The ac conductivity sigma(ac)(omega, T) and the complex dielectric permittivity epsilon*(omega, T) were extensively investigated as a function of both frequency (5-100kHz) and temperature (100KT<400K). The general trend of the mentioned parameters indicates that the frequency dependent conductivity behaves according to the power law, namely sigma(ac)(omega, T)alpha omega(s(omega, T)) where s is the frequency exponent (0s<1). Furthermore, the differential scanning calorimetric chart and the differential thermal analysis thermogram were performed. The combination of thermal and electrical parameters confirms the existence of two main structural phase transitions of the first-order type at T approximate to 360.70K (minor) and at T approximate to 350.70K (major) in addition to two intermediate phases with a transition temperature at T approximate to 353.75K. (The major transition precedes the minor one.) Different conduction mechanisms and the universality of ac conduction were discussed. The nature of each detected phase transition has been explained on the basis of the most recent crystal structure and particularly the role of the N-H [GRAPHICS] Cl hydrogen bonding as a trigger force for phase transitions.",2015
Multiscale Approach to Shock to Detonation Transition in Energetic Materials,"In this work we present a multiscale approach for coupling the dynamics of void collapse at the microscale to simulations at the mesoscale. We solve the reactive Euler equations, with the energy equation augmented by a power deposition term. The reaction rate at the mesoscale is modelled using a pressure-dependent power law. The deposition term is based on previous simulations of void collapse, modelled at the mesoscale as hot-spots. The equation of state was previously calibrated for PBX 9501.

"5-Amino-3,4-dinitropyrazole as a Promising Energetic Material","The nitrogen-rich energetic compound 5-amino-3,4-dinitropyrazole (5-ADP) was investigated using complementary experimental techniques. X-ray diffraction indicates the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in 5-ADP crystals. Compound exhibits low impact sensitivity (23J) and insensitivity to friction. The activation energy of thermolysis determined to be 230 +/- 5kJmol(-1) from DSC measurements. Accelerating rate calorimetry indicates the lower thermal stability (173 degrees C) of 5-ADP than that of RDX, which is probably the main concern about using this compound. 5-ADP also exhibits good compatibility with common energetic materials (viz. TNT, RDX, ammonium perchlorate), including an active binder. The burning rate of 5-ADP monopropellant is higher than that of benchmark HMX, while the pressure exponent 0.51 +/- 0.04 is surprisingly low. Addition of ammonium perchlorate does not affect the pressure exponent of 5-ADP, while the burning rate increases. The 5-amino-3,4-dinitropyrazole exhibits a notable combination of combustion performance, low sensitivity, and good compatibility, which renders it as a promising energetic material.",2016
Probing intermolecular interactions of ZnO-nanoparticle-reinforced molten energetic material,"In this work, metal oxide nanoparticle ZnO was employed for the reinforcement of TNT.

A multi-objective modeling approach for energetic material evaluation decisions,"To develop ordnance for military applications requires a decision process of selecting materials. Once selected a performance evaluation of the material composite formulations energetic properties is required. Tailoring the composite materials for a particular ordnance application requires selecting reactants that seek ail optimized combination of economic costs and performance properties (e.g., energy release, temperature, and gas generation). A successful energetic material evaluation must identify reactants offering a good fit with performance requirements and an overall materials selection strategy. To aid energetic material users in making complex reactant selection decisions we introduce a modeling approach that combines the concepts of thermodynamics, economic costs, and goal programming. This study is unique in its application of goal programming in exploring this type of decision situation. A case study is used to illustrate the modeling approach. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for evaluating formulations where performance properties are important. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2009

Regulation of stability and density of energetic materials ,"Selective regulation of stability and density via isomerism is a promising strategy for developing energetic materials. In this work, we selectively introduced dinitromethyl groups at different positions of 4-nitro-1,2,3-triazole. The regional heterogeneity endows a high crystal density by virtue of the dense packing; on the other hand, it changes the charge distribution in the molecule, and reinforces the hydrogen bonding interactions, all of which stabilize the material. The resulting compounds exhibit excellent detonation properties and impact sensitivity that are comparable to those of HMX (D-v = 9250 m s(-1) and IS = 10 J).",2023

All complexes were characterized using low temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The magnetic properties of six of the complexes were investigated. Due to the energetic characters, the sensitivities towards impact and friction were investigated using the BAM drophammer and friction tester. The values range from ""very sensitive"", comparable to primary explosives, to ""insensitive"" depending on the amount of water or ammonia coordinated. Since Cu(II) salts can be used for colorants in pyrotechnics, the combustions and flame colors were discovered to be intensively green. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",2009
"Azo substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles as insensitive energetic materials","5,5'-Diamino-3,3'-azo-1,2,4-oxadiazole (3) was synthesized by reacting 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-oxadiazolewith potassium permanganate in the presence of an organic solvent. Nitration of 5-amino-3-azo-1,2,4-oxadiazole gave rise to the 1,2,4-oxadiazolone (4) directly rather than the nitramine compound. Energetic salts of oxadiazolone 4 were prepared by treating with amine bases. These high nitrogen compounds were fully characterized using IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and, in case of 3, with single crystal X-ray structuring. All the azo-substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are impact insensitive materials.",2014
